<file>decentralized-api-dapi.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>API services that are intrinsically interoperable with blockchain technology are known as decentralized application programming interfaces (dAPIs). This is an invention of the API3 protocol.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is  Decentralized API (dAPI)?</h2>
<div>APIs are the backbone of the new digital economy, serving as a fundamental component of digital solutions and the focal point of the API Economy. APIs have been centralized for a long time, however, many decentralized platforms use blockchain technology to provide completely decentralized APIs. A great example of it is decentralized apps (dApps) that work on a decentralized system, thanks to dAPIs. While dAPIs are comparable to conventional APIs in terms of functionality, legacy APIs are centralized and not inherently compliant with blockchain technology. </div>
<p>To understand decentralized APIs you have to understand what an API is:</p>
<div>An Application Programming Interface (API) is a well-defined and well-documented mechanism that allows web and mobile apps to communicate with one another by transferring data and services. Online companies can now provide their data and services as marketable service modules through an API, which developers can subsequently incorporate into their apps. This enhances the efficiency of software development in terms of both cost and time. When compared to the days when developers had to design every feature of their program from scratch, it is easy to see why APIs have become the most important building blocks in the digital world.</div>
<div>The difference between centralized and decentralized APIs is clearly identifiable.</div>
<div>The API gateway in a decentralized system redirects queries to other API endpoints, which may be the backend of an application or a public API of the app's trading partner. At runtime, the API gateway is in charge of handling the appropriate protocol, security, and data conversions.</div>
<div>The data is gathered in a central data store, which is part of the API platform, in a centralized arrangement. Through asynchronous connections, this central data store maintains near real-time bi-directional synchronization with the linked backend applications and business partners. The API queries are sent straight to the central data storage in this situation.</div>
<h2>The Oracle Problem</h2>
<div>The "oracle problem" refers to smart contracts' inability to obtain data that is not already available on the blockchain. This implies that the smart contracts driving these apps are unable to directly access APIs from the blockchain in which the contract is stored owing to the unique consensus-based security assurances gained from employing a decentralized network of nodes as the application platform. A solution is required that allows smart contracts to access API data while maintaining the underlying system's security assurances to the maximum extent possible without adding new attack surfaces. </div>
<div>Decentralized API services solve this problem by managing various data providers as they are blockchain-based. The difference between dAPIs and existing decentralized oracle solutions is that, unlike current solutions, dAPIs include the APIs that underpin the data feed in the context of the solution. In comparison to existing decentralized oracles, which do not regard the data source API in the scope of their solution, this allows them to deliver greater data transparency down to the true data source level.</div>

<title>Shielded Transaction</title>

<preview>A shielded transaction is essentially a transaction that is between two shielded addresses.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Shielded Transaction?</h2>
<p>Shielded addresses are ones that use zero-knowledge proofs to allow transaction data to be encrypted by remaining verifiable by network nodes. </p>
<p>A shielded transaction is essentially a transaction that is between two shielded addresses. This will essentially keep the addresses, transaction amount and the memo field shielded from the public, with an exception of migrating funds between Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses. </p>
<p>Senders to a shielded address can or can not include an encrypted memo, and the recipients of a shielded or deshielding transaction do not learn about the sender address through the transaction receipt in their wallet. The receivers can only learn the value which is sent to their address and if they receive to shielded addresses, any encrypted memo that has been included by the member.</p>
<p>Arguably the best implementation in terms of shielded transactions we have seen thus far is in Zcash. In Zcash, there are  two types of addresses, transparent addresses and shielded addresses. Transparent addresses on the Zcash protocol are equivalent to public addresses on the Bitcoin protocol for example, and function similarly as a result. All transparent addresses interact with the Transparent Value Pool and this is what publicly reveals transaction data and allows it to be viewed on the Zcash blockchain at any time by anyone. </p>
<p>On the flipside, shielded addresses encrypt the transaction data and require the generation of zkSNARKs in order to verify the transaction’s validity. These shielded addresses bring a new, higher level of privacy as well as security when we compare them to transparent addresses. So, a transparent address to a transparent address would result in an unshielded transaction, a transparent address to a shielded address would result in a shielded transaction, a shielded address to a shielded address would result in a shielded transaction, and a shielded address to a transparent address would result in an unshielded transaction.</p>

<title>0x Protocol</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/0x-protocol</url>
<file>0x-protocol.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>0x is an Ethereum-based open-source platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies. It allows for the creation of features in a decentralized exchange (DEX), a wallet or a marketplace.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the 0x Protocol?</h2>
<div>Built on the Ethereum blockchain, 0x is an open-source protocol that allows for the frictionless peer-to-peer exchange of cryptocurrencies. The team sees a future in which the Ethereum network will be used to tokenize all forms of assets.</div>
<div>For example, instead of going through a lengthy procedure involving attorneys and escrow agents when selling a home, the 0x protocol provides a comprehensive solution that can be used to tokenize the property and transfer ownership to the buyer via a smart contract. This eliminates the need for any costly intermediaries while also speeding up the whole process, thereby turning real estate into a liquid asset.</div>
<div>With the 0x Launch Kit, anybody can create their own decentralized exchange (DEX) on top of 0x and collect fees for their services. The 0x protocol is a standard message format for exchanges, comparable to SWIFT, which is the standard messaging system used by banks all over the globe to communicate about fiat currency transfers.</div>
<div>The 0x API (application programming interface) was also released, which combines liquidity throughout the network and allows customers to exchange assets at higher prices – at all times.</div>
<h2>How Does 0x Protocol Work?</h2>
<div>On the Ethereum blockchain, the 0x team has created a standard protocol that allows for the exchange of tokens and the construction of new decentralized apps (dApps). Because they keep an off-chain order book and can charge transactions fee (or other fees) for their services, these new initiatives built on top of the 0x protocol are known as relayers.</div>
<p>Augur, Status, district0x, Dharma, Blocknet, Request Network, and a slew of other projects have already opted to build atop 0x.</p>
<p>The 0x protocol, being a decentralized exchange, is free of the drawbacks that come with centralized exchanges. While centralized exchanges offer the ease of use, high-performance trading, and advanced tools, they also have a number of drawbacks, such as security failures (the middleman can be hacked, shut down, or run away with customers' funds), downtime (due to hikes or high traffic spikes), and various fees.</p>
<p>Decentralized exchanges, in this sense, eliminate the requirement for trust by allowing anyone to trade on the Ethereum blockchain without having to deposit money via a central entity.</p>
<p>Untrustworthy situations have their own set of difficulties and drawbacks. Decentralized exchanges have certain drawbacks, including the fact that every new transaction or alteration must be validated on the blockchain, which may be costly and time-consuming.</p>
<p>By integrating off-chain ordering relays with on-chain settlements, the 0x protocol tries to address these inefficiencies. This implies that users can push an order off the blockchain to be filled by another user, and only value orders are processed on-chain, saving users money on gas fees. It's just a more secure, less expensive, and faster way for consumers to exchange ERC20 tokens.</p>
<h2>What Makes 0x Protocol Unique?</h2>
<p>The message structure of the 0x protocol is made up of a number of data fields that contain crucial information including the digital asset or token to be exchanged, the transaction's price, the expiration time, and the stated identities of the transacting parties.</p>
<p>Smart contracts handle the business logic for creating, sending, receiving, and processing data related to trading activities. It also makes room for any necessary improvements in the future. If any adjustments are required to comply with the changed legislation or any alterations related to the Ethereum blockchain network's intrinsic operation, the provisions for upgrades are required.</p>
<p>Relayers, which operate as order aggregators and broadcast orders from specified market players to the marketplace or exchange, are also used in the system.</p>

<title>51% Attack</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/51-attack</url>
<file>51-attack.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>If more than half the computer power or mining hash rate on a network is run by a single person or a single group of people, then a 51% attack is in operation.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a &quot;51% Attack&quot;?</h2>
<p>A 51% attack refers to a malicious actor (or group acting in concert), controlling over 50% of the total mining power of the blockchain network and disrupting the integrity of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Due to the way blockchain functions, consensus is required for transactions to be confirmed or added. A bad actor who controls the majority of the hashing or mining power can theoretically &quot;form the majority&quot; in this consensus mechanism and disrupt the integrity of the blockchain by modifying the order of transactions, preventing transactions from being confirmed, or double spend.</p>
<p>The risk of a 51% attack is higher for blockchains with less hashing power, as it is easier for a malicious actor to procure the required majority computing power. The more miners and resources spent mining a blockchain, the safer the blockchain is. The Bitcoin network is recognized as the safest blockchain in existence as it has the largest amount of hashing power mining it.</p>
<div>An example of a 51% attack happened in January 2019 on the altcoin Ethereum Classic blockchain.</div>

<title>52-Week High/Low</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/52-week-high-low</url>
<file>52-week-high-low.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A 52-week high and low is the highest and lowest market price of a given asset over 52 weeks or one year.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a 52-Week High/Low?</h2>
<p>The 52-week high/low is the highest and the lowest price at which a crypto token or other asset has traded over 52 weeks. Investors use it to analyze an asset’s current price to predict its future price movements. A tradable asset often garners more attention from investors when it nears its 52-week high or low.</p>
<h2>How Do Investors Determine the 52-Week High/Low?</h2>
<p>The closing price of an asset determines the 52-week high/low. An asset may fluctuate above or below its 52-week record during a trading session. However, if the price does not close above or below this record, changes do not display as hitting a new high or low.</p>
<h2>Why Does the 52-Week High/Low Matter?</h2>
<p>Investors in the financial markets can use this 52-week high/low metric to set their entry or exit point for a given asset. In most cases, these fluctuations signal that the asset has reached its peak or low and may not rise or fall in the short term.</p>
<p>As a result, the 52-week high/low metric offers a level of resistance or support for a given tradable asset. Alternatively, suppose a stock pushes past its 52-week high and continues climbing. In that case, it could be an indicator that there are factors generating momentum to carry the price above the previous high. Investors believe this momentum will continue pushing prices in the same direction, making it a good time to buy. The same rationale can be applied to assets that dip below their 52-week low.</p>
<h2>52-Week High/Low Reversals</h2>
<div>A tradable asset that reaches a 52-week high intraday but closes negative that same day may have topped out. It means that the price might not go much higher soon. It can be determined if it forms a daily shooting star, which is when a security trades higher than its opening but starts dropping later in the day to close at or below the opening price. 52-week highs are often used to determine stop-loss levels to limit losses.</div>
<div>Given the upward bias inherent in the traditional markets, a 52-week high is a sign of bullish sentiment in the markets. There are usually many investors ready to give up some further price appreciation to lock some or all of the gains. Assets that hit the 52-week high are often the most susceptible to profit-taking, which leads to pullbacks and trend reversals.</div>
<p>The same applies when a stock hits a 52-week low but fails to register a new closing low. It is often an indication of a looming bottom. When that happens, short-sellers can start buying the asset to cover their positions.</p>
<p>Whether or not you believe in momentum when making investment choices, reviewing an asset’s 52-week highs and lows can help you make profitable decisions.</p>

<h2>How to Use 52-Week High/Low Metric in Crypto?</h2>
<div>Traders often use this metric within the crypto sector to provide fundamental market insight. It is offered on all exchanges, including FTX and Binance.</div>

<title>52-Week Range</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/52-week-range</url>
<file>52-week-range.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A 52-week range is a difference between an asset’s highest and lowest prices over the past 52 weeks.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a 52-Week Range?</h2>
<p>A 52-week range is the data point that includes the highest and lowest price at which an asset has traded in the past 52 weeks ( which is around one year). As a result, it is often also called the yearly range.</p>
<div>The 52-week range offers information on an asset's volatility and where its current price is relative to the highest and lows in the past year. If the difference is more significant, it indicates an asset has great volatility. However, this must be considered relatively. For instance, a $5 difference between the highs and lows for a $10 stock is not the same as that of a $100 stock. The former has price swings of around 50%, while the latter saw price swings of just 5%.</div>
<p>Checking the current price of an asset lets traders know whether an asset is vital (trading near its high) or weak (trading near its low).</p>
<p>The one-year period is arbitrary, and it may or may not hold importance to all traders. For day traders, the daily range is more important. For a long-term holder, the highs and lows over several years mean more than a single 52-week range.</p>
<h2>Strategies Used for the 52-Week Range</h2>
<div>The most straightforward trading strategy for the 52-week range is to focus on price relative to the highs and lows. Traders will be more likely to trade asset prices near the low end since the low often indicates a support level. Additionally, assets at the high end of the range may see more actions as they test resistance levels numerous times.</div>
<div>Most 52-week strategies require some technical analysis. Traders look for simple and complex patterns, open positions with stop losses, and target prices based on historical figures.</div>
<h2>Limitations of the 52-Week Range Strategy</h2>
<div>The 52-week range only tells you the past performance of an asset. It does not tell you about the factors driving such performance. For instance, if an asset loses 20% from its 52-week high and continues to drop, it is important to look at the news driving this trend. This information is not immediately apparent when looking at the 52-week highs/lows.</div>
<p>It is important to realize that the 52-week data cannot tell you anything about price relative to movement. You will need to investigate other metrics to get a clear picture. For instance, an asset that is trading way above its 52-week high cannot tell investors whether it is overvalued, undervalued or valued the right way. Just because it is above its 52-week high, it isn’t necessary that it is a good investment.</p>

<title>Abenomics</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/abenomics</url>
<file>abenomics.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Abenomics is the economic strategy implemented by Shinzo Abe of Japan and is comprised of three arrows: monetary policy, fiscal stimulus and structural reforms.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Abenomics?</h2>
<p>Abenomics is a set of economic policies implemented by Japan under the administration of Prime Minister Shinz Abe, which rescued the country from its deflationary slump. In an effort to extricate Japan from deflation, economic policies integrated with structural changes were adopted.</p>
<div>Abenomics is frequently perceived as aggressive measures affecting the country's monetary and fiscal status. It involves boosting fiscal and monetary stimulation through government expenditure and unusual central bank policy, respectively.</div>
<div>Abenomics, which was implemented in 2012, aimed to attain an inflation target of 2% to eliminate deflation and the near-stagnation of the Japanese economy since the 1990s. Its immediate objective was to increase domestic demand and GDP expansion.</div>
<h2>Condition of Japan Before Abenomics</h2>
<p>In 1996, the gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3%, signaling a rebound from the bursting of a large asset-price bubble in the early 1990s. In April 1997, the Japanese government increased the consumption tax from 3% to 5%, with the expectation of further hikes in 1998.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Thai Baht peg on 2 July 1997, there was a financial crisis in East and South-East Asia, which had extensive effects on the whole region. After the tax increase, nominal GDP growth stayed below zero for the majority of the subsequent five years. It even had an impact on the average yearly wage in the country, which increased between 1992 and 1997, but began to decline following the 1997 tax increase. Since 1997, wage declines have exceeded nominal GDP declines.</p>
<p>In order to balance the national budget, the Teikoku Gikai under former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda enacted a measure in 2012 to increase the consumption tax to 8% in 2014 and 10% in 2015; this tax rise was intended to discourage spending further.</p>
<h2>Did Abenomics Work?</h2>
<div>Monetary policy, one of the three arrows, is intended to reduce interest rates. This had a substantial impact on the devaluation of the Japanese yen. In 2013, it was suggested that the weakening of the yen may be beneficial for the Japanese economy since it could assist exports and encourage other currencies to purchase more Japanese-made goods. The greater the sales volume of manufacturers, the greater the corporate earnings, which would result in more company investment. Nonetheless, as of December 2017, the inflation rate was 1%, which was below the goal rate of 2%. However, one positive aspect of the recent expansion of the Japanese economy is the need for high-tech goods. Japan was able to resort to layout-saving technologies as a result of the three-arrow strategy, which has helped the economy overcome its labor shortage and increased productivity. There has been a rise in tourism, which has helped to bolster the economy.</div>
<h2>The Three Arrows of Abenomics </h2>
<p>Shinz Abe's tenure lasted from 2006 to 2007, but when he returned to the government in 2012 for a second term, he brought with him economic measures that would act as answers to Japan's deflation. To revitalize Japan's stagnating economy, he implemented Abenomics. Monetary policies, fiscal policies, and structural changes or growth plans are the three primary components of Abenomics. The monetary policy is centered on the injection of new money in the range of 60 to 70 trillion yen, and the second component is to enhance government expenditure, which would provide a fiscal stimulus. The third component of Abenomics needs Japan's industries and corporations to undergo considerable transformation.</p>

<title>Abnormal Return</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/abnormal-return</url>
<file>abnormal-return.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Abnormal return refers to the unusual profits from certain assets or securities over a specific time period.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Abnormal Return?</h2>
<p>Abnormal return refers to investment returns that are excessively high or low. In such instances, the performance of the investment or funds deviates from the normal and expected rate of return. The impacts of an abnormal return are temporary and may be the result of abnormal fundamentals or fraudulent activity on the part of the entity holding the money. </p>
<p>Abnormal return is distinct from Alpha and excess returns, which are attributable to the investment managers' performance. On the other hand, Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) is the sum of all abnormal returns and is used to monitor the effects of external threats on stock prices.</p>
<h2>Importance of Abnormal Returns</h2>
<div>When assessing a portfolio's performance relative to the wider market or benchmark index, abnormal return is crucial. It aids in assessing and recognizing the risk-adjustment expertise of a portfolio manager. It also indicates if investors have received compensation for the level of assumed investment risk. </div>
<p>Most importantly, an abnormal return is not the same as a negative return. It can be both positive and negative. The final number is a summary of the difference between actual and expected returns. Abnormal returns are a valuable evaluative metric for comparing returns to market performance.</p>
<h2>Abnormal Return as an Evaluation Metric</h2>
<p>With abnormal returns, you may determine a portfolio's risk-adjusted performance relative to market norms and benchmark indexes. You can thus determine if your investments adequately pay you for the risk you are incurring. A positive or negative abnormal return is calculated by subtracting actual returns from anticipated returns.</p>
<p>If a mutual fund with an expected annual return of 12% achieves a return of 26%, this indicates an abnormal return of 14%. In contrast, if it truly provided a return of 3%, you will receive a negative 9% abnormal return. </p>
<h2>What Is Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?</h2>
<p>The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) calculates the expected rate of return for a certain portfolio or investment. It describes the association between risk and expected return. After determining expected income, abnormal income may be determined by subtracting the expected yield from realized return rate. Abnormal returns are based on the performance of securities or portfolios.</p>
<h2>Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR)</h2>
<p>Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR), as previously mentioned, refers to the aggregate of abnormal returns over a specific time period. It enables investors to evaluate the performance of an asset or security over a given length of time, particularly since abnormal returns during short time frames tend to be skewed.</p>
<h2>Example of Abnormal Return</h2>
<p>In certain instances, stock prices vary in response to the social media activity of a company's team. Tesla's stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) was banned from trading for a few days in 2018 after CEO, Elon Musk, tweeted about turning the firm private at $420 per share.</p>
<p>Additionally, financial disclosures cause abnormal returns. For instance, in early February 2020, Spotify's (NASDAQ: SPOT) stock price declined following the revelation of a considerably larger-than-expected loss.</p>

<title>Absolute Advantage</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/absolute-advantage</url>
<file>absolute-advantage.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Absolute advantage is a situation in which a company can produce the same product as other companies using fewer resources.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Absolute Advantage?</h2>
<p>Absolute advantage is a concept in economics that describes a situation in which one firm is able to produce and distribute the same items as another company while using fewer resources. It is a measure of how much output an organization generates. When a corporation has access to extra resources, it might potentially improve the effectiveness of its design and production processes. One of the biggest benefits of absolute advantage is that it can be used to increase the efficiency of any company's production process. For example, if one company has a higher production level than another company, it can produce more goods at the same cost. The greater the advantage, the more efficient the production process will be. </p>
<h2>Adam Smith’s View on Absolute Advantage</h2>
<p>Adam Smith (1723-1790) proposed that countries should focus their production on the types of products at which they have a significant competitive edge. Mr. Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was also a pioneer in the field of political economy, is regarded as the father of modern economics.</p>
<p>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, written by Mr. Smith in 1776, was the first work in which the ideas of absolute advantage were outlined. He discussed it within the framework of international commerce.</p>
<p>When economies specialize in certain industries and engage in trade, they are able to expand outside their own markets. When an economy expands outside its borders, it opens itself up to the possibility of consuming a greater quantity of commodities.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Smith, it is not feasible for all economies to grow rich at the same time by adhering to the principles of mercantilism. This is because what one nation exports, another nation imports.</p>
<p>Instead, the open exchange of goods and services would benefit all nations simultaneously. Every nation ought to develop expertise in areas in which they hold a clear competitive advantage.</p>
<h2>Example of Absolute Advantage</h2>
<p>An example of absolute advantage is the position of the Canadian economy in the world market for agricultural commodities in comparison to that of the majority of other nations. This is due to the low prices as well as the comparatively high availability of land in Canada.</p>
<p>On the other hand, countries such as China, Thailand and Vietnam specialize in the production and export of low-cost manufactured products. Because of the significantly reduced unit labor costs they have, these three nations enjoy a significant competitive edge.</p>
<p>Italy's yearly wine production is approximately four billion gallons, which is more than double that of the United States' 700 million gallons. The United States uses more resources to manufacture a single bottle of wine than Italy does, giving Italy a significant competitive edge. The output of Italy is significantly higher than that of the United States throughout the same period of time.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Absolute Advantage and Comparative Advantage </h2>
<p>The concept of absolute advantage contrasts with the concept of comparative advantage. The following are two significant distinctions between them:</p>
<p>People or nations who possess an absolute advantage are in a better position to succeed than they would be if they possessed a comparative advantage. If a company has an absolute edge over its competitors, it will be able to develop the same asset much more swiftly. The ability of a company to produce an item at a lower opportunity cost is what is meant by the term &quot;comparative advantage.&quot;</p>
<p>For instance, a firm that specializes in technology may develop software for both mobile devices and PCs, but it is impossible for the company to work on both applications at the same time. The executives make the decision to concentrate first on mobile application development. The team has the capacity to create either four mobile programs or eight computer programs in a single year. As a result, the opportunity cost of producing either one mobile program or two computer programs is two computer programs or one mobile program, respectively. If the price is less than that of similar brands sold by competitors, then the technology business has a cost advantage.</p>
<p>One other distinction that can be made between absolute and comparative advantage is the reliance that each has on the other. The use of comparative advantage, in conjunction with absolute advantage, may be beneficial to a company's operations or to international trade. Imagine that a certain business or country enjoys a number of absolute advantages over its competitors. The parties engaged may concentrate on the relative advantage amongst themselves rather than depending on a single organization to offer assets to the rest of the globe.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Absolute Return?</h2>
<p>The return on an investment calculated over a predetermined amount of time is called absolute return. It is a measurement of the overall worth of an asset that has increased or decreased and is expressed as a percentage. It evaluates the overall profit or loss that resulted from the investment and can either be positive or negative.</p>
<h2>How to Calculate Absolute Return? </h2>
<div>To calculate an absolute return, you only need two variables: the current value of your asset/portfolio and the initial value of your asset/portfolio.</div>
<p>The formula of Absolute Return = </p>
<h2>What Is Annualized Return?</h2>
<p>Unlike absolute return, the annualized return is the annual return the investor will receive from their investment. An annualized return rate can be determined by using the compound annual growth rate. The compounding of returns over the course of time is referred to as the compound annual growth rate (CAGR). It provides potential investors an understanding of the results of an investment, but it doesn't inform them of how unpredictable the investment is.</p>
<p>Although it is straightforward to calculate an absolute return, it is not easy to translate this figure into terms that are applicable to other types of investments. A clearer picture may be obtained by comparing different types of mutual funds that have traded across a range of different time periods. This is only true if you continually reinvest the money you make from your business.</p>
<p>It is hard to determine which investment is the most profitable due to the varying time frames and rates of return. This problem is solved by using an annualized return that presents the returns using an expression equivalent to one year.</p>

<h2>What Is Abstract?</h2>
<p>An abstract is something that exists in thought as an idea, but doesn’t have physical or even concrete actuality. It can also be seen as a summary of points that are usually presented in skeletal form. An abstract can be something that can actually summarize or even concentrate the essential aspects of a larger thing or several things. </p>
<p>The abstract is actually a word that comes from a Latin word that means pulled away or detached, and the idea is that something is detached from physical, or concrete reality.</p>

<title>Accepting Risk (Acceptance)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/accepting-risk-acceptance</url>
<file>accepting-risk-acceptance.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Accepting risk, also known as risk acceptance, is a risk management strategy employed by companies to accept risks linked to certain events instead of investing resources to tackle them.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accepting Risk (Acceptance)?</h2>
<p>When a company or an individual says they accept risk, it indicates that they are prepared to deal with the risks that have been discovered, and they won't take any action since they are willing to bear the consequences. This component of risk management is also known as &quot;risk retention,&quot; and it is most frequently encountered in the business or investment sector. </p>
<p>Accepting risks, also known as risk acceptance, is used in situations where not taking any measures to tackle a problem turns out to be the most cost-effective choice. The company has a mindset that the risk is really low, and as a result, they are prepared to deal with the repercussions.</p>
<h2>Identification of Risks</h2>
<p>Different strategies are utilized by companies in order to mitigate the dangers connected to a particular transaction or economic activity, such as the operation of a factory. In order to monitor potential dangers and lessen their impact, a company must first determine what those dangers are, then determine how severe they are, and then rank them in order of priority. An improved risk management strategy is the driving force behind a prosperous company.</p>
<div>When it comes to risk management, companies need to be able to strike a balance between the expenses associated with risk management and the costs that result from the risk itself. Credit risk, project failures, uncertainty in financial markets, accidents, legal obligations, natural catastrophes and dangers from rivals are some of the most typical forms of hazards that businesses face.</div>
<h2>What Leads to Accepting Risk in a Company?</h2>
<p>The consequences of the risk and the expenses involved in mitigating the risk have to be weighed against one another. A company needs to decide which risks are most important to it and then allocate money to cover those risks. A company will purchase many types of insurance to protect itself against a variety of threats, including insurance for its employees, its stock, and its building.</p>
<p>It's possible for a company to take on risks that are out of proportion to its resources and capabilities, although these instances are rare. When a firm undergoes a merger or acquisition that results in the assumption of a higher debt than it is able to pay, this situation arises. Additionally, it's possible that the corporation won't be able to successfully manage the merged operation while still reaping the benefits of the synergies created by the merger.</p>
<h2>Alternatives to Accepting Risk</h2>
<p>An organization does not always go for accepting risk as a risk management strategy. After evaluating the numerous risks, organizations decide whether to accept the risks, avoid them, minimize them or transfer them. Accepting risk is a strategy that can be useful in a variety of contexts; however, there are also the following ways to risk management:</p>
<div>Risk transfer refers to the practice of transferring risks from one party to another through the use of a contract. In essence, one party is responsible for bearing the repercussions of the other party's risks. With this type of allocation, responsibility for risk is confirmed to be placed on a party that possesses the capacity to control it. This is a strategy that is frequently utilized by insurance firms.</div>
<div>Risk avoidance is the process of fleeing from situations that might result in a loss of some kind. This is the best choice when dealing with potentially catastrophic hazards. Any significant influence on the continued operation of the firm is prevented. </div>
<div>Risk mitigation is achieved by managers through the development of policies and procedures, the application of technology and the provision of training. This kind of risk management is effective in factories that run the risk of suffering significant financial losses should any of their assets fail.</div>
<div>Risk reduction is to be viewed as an absolute last resort. When the danger has already materialized or when the probability is extremely high, it is vital to place restrictions on the outcomes. An approach like this helps organizations get ready for the worst possible outcomes. Hedging is the most effective method for accomplishing this goal. When investors observe price swings that are not in their favor, they act in this manner.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Account?</h2>
<div>An account is essentially the record in an accounting system whose purpose is to track the financial activities of a specific asset, expense, revenue, equity or liability. All of these records can increase and decrease as specific events occur throughout the accounting period. Every individual account is stored in a general ledger, where it can be used to prepare the financial statements at the end of the accounting period.</div>
<p>In other words, accounts are these records or statements of financial expenditure and receipts that relate to a particular period or purpose.  </p>
<p>In the world of crypto, this is referred to as a cryptocurrency account. It gives you certain benefits, and it is a requirement in order to use just about any cryptocurrency exchange. A cryptocurrency account gives you access to hot wallets, which allow you to quickly buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies, and it gives you an identity or a way through which you can hold onto your public keys when it comes to the aforementioned process. </p>
<p>You can also receive certain promotions through your account, and it is generally used on your end to manage everything on the platform or exchange you choose to participate in. Your account is essentially your main command console where you can configure everything to your liking, from specific preferences to spending limits.</p>

<title>Account Balance</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/account-balance</url>
<file>account-balance.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Account balance refers to the amount in a bank/cryptocurrency account that can be accessed immediately. It also refers to the difference between all debit and credit transactions.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Account Balance?</h2>
<p>The total amount of money that may be withdrawn from a bank account or a crypto account is referred to as the &quot;account balance&quot; in the banking and finance industry. Accounts are used to enable transactions by people, corporations and enterprises alike. These accounts offer an alternative to the conventional methods of dealing with cash transactions. There are different kinds of crypto and bank accounts available that may be used by entities to store and transfer assets and send and receive payments.</p>
<h2>Accounting Cash Flow From Bank Accounts</h2>
<div>In banking, the account balance includes both deposits and withdrawals made from a bank account. However, any sum paid out of these accounts results in a negative cash flow. As a consequence of this, the total balance in the bank account decreases (and in some cases, it results in overdraft). These payments may also include the bank's costs or other fees. To be more specific, though, they often include cash withdrawals or payments made to third parties.</div>
<h2>Account Balance in Loan Accounts</h2>
<p>In some circumstances, a bank may also provide an entity with financing in the form of a loan. If this is the case, then they will also be given a bank account. On the other hand, the account balance won't be the same in certain circumstances. It will be used to refer to the amount that must be paid to the bank by the entity, rather than the cash that can be spent. However, this term does not apply to savings or checking accounts; it is only applicable to loan accounts.</p>
<p>In general, an account balance in banking refers to the entire amount of money that is held by an entity within its own bank account. As was previously stated, this may involve checking as well as savings accounts. After deducting all of the payments made from the receipts into the bank account, the remaining balance is shown. </p>
<h2>What Is Account Balance in Accounting?</h2>
<p>The term account balance is applicable to banking, crypto and accounting. In accounting, the difference between all of the transactions that have been debited from and credited to a ledger account is referred to as the account balance. These accounts might be for assets, liabilities, or even stock in the company. In each of these cases, the amount that is remaining in the account will have a distinct significance.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, account balances for assets are shown as debit balances. These things reflect an asset that is held or managed by an entity and has the potential to offer economic advantages in the future. In most cases, assets consist mostly of debit transactions rather than credit ones. As a result, they will be in a position to have a positive balance, presuming that the debit transactions had a beneficial impact.</p>
<p>Account balances often contain credit balances in case of liability and equity. When it comes to liabilities, these balances indicate the responsibilities that were incurred as a result of previous transactions that led to the loss of economic gains. When referring to an entity's equity, these amounts will be the sum that may be distributed to owners or shareholders from the operations of the business. </p>
<p>The aforementioned principles, when taken as a whole, are applicable to any and all assets, liabilities and equity balances that organizations may have. However, there are likely to be some deviations from these rules, such as the existence of counter accounts. In certain specific circumstances, the opposite treatment will be applied to each individual object. For example, counter asset accounts tend to build up credit balances instead of debit balances over time.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Available Balance and Current Balance</h2>
<p>The amount of balance that is accessible for spending is called available balance. The available balance in an account is used to determine whether or not the user has sufficient funds in their account to cover a transaction. The account's available balance is calculated using the deposits and withdrawals from the account as well as all pending transactions. Pending transactions include pre-authorized transfers, point-of-sale transactions and merchant payments.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may notice that your available balance is lower than your current. In these circumstances, the only money you have access to is the sum that is accessible to you (or a lesser amount if you have checks that are still outstanding), and the rest of the funds are being kept by the financial institution that you use. Your current balances take into account all of your money, including both the amounts that are currently accessible and those that are being held.</p>

<title>Account Number</title>

<preview>An account number is a string of numbers (and sometimes letters) that is used to identify a specific bank account and the account holder.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Account Number? </h2>
<p>An account number is a string of numbers (and sometimes letters) that is used to identify a specific bank account and account holder. In this manner, financial institutions are able to give access to the account in a secure manner so that customers may send and receive payments.</p>
<p>When you create an account with a bank, the very first piece of information that is provided to you is a unique account number. Either a checking account or a savings account can serve this purpose. Every single form of banking transaction necessitates the use of an account number, regardless of whether the transaction takes place within the same branch or between two different financial institutions.</p>
<p>In the past, social security numbers were assigned to serve this purpose. However, the prevalence of their use led to an increase in instances of fraud and theft of identity. As a result, financial institutions have steadily distanced themselves from the practice. Even though social security numbers are still in use, account numbers are required in order to conduct banking transactions nowadays.</p>
<p>In today's world, even though security precautions, such as multi-factor authentication, have helped reduce the number of instances of fraud and theft over the course of time, the numbers associated with bank accounts are still at risk of being stolen and put to harmful uses if account holders aren't careful enough to engage in secure online banking practices.</p>
<h2>What Is a Routing Number?</h2>
<div>A nine-digit number that specifies the financial institution (bank or credit union) where an account is stored is referred to as the routing number. These numbers are also known as ABA routing numbers, which is a reference to the American Bankers Association, the organization responsible for assigning them. A routing number is proof that a financial institution is chartered at either the federal or state level and has an account with the Federal Reserve. This is a number that is exclusively used within the United States.</div>
<h2>How to Find Your Bank Account Number and Routing Number?</h2>
<p>You may locate your account and routing numbers: </p>
<p>At the bottom left-hand side of the check that is associated with your checking account</p>
<p>By logging in to your online banking account, or </p>
<p>By asking a representative of the financial institution where you have your account.</p>
<p>Source: aba.com</p>
<p>Because the routing number associated with your financial institution is not linked solely to your account, it is possible that you can locate it online easily. If this is the case, you will need to ensure that the website you use is the one that is owned by your financial institution. It may be possible that other websites compile the routing number information for a number of different financial institutions in order to make things more convenient. However, it is preferable to obtain the number directly from the institution.</p>
<p>When you are ready to offer your bank's routing and account numbers for a transaction involving your bank, double-check the information you obtained from your sources to ensure that the numbers are accurate. Even if you're wrong by a single number, the transaction won't go through successfully. In certain circumstances, you might be asked to input your account number twice before the system will accept it. This is done to ensure that the information is accurate and to reduce the likelihood of mistakes.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Accountability is the requirement or readiness to assume responsibility for one's actions.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accountability?</h2>
<p>Accountability is the requirement or readiness to assume responsibility for one's actions. When someone accepts responsibility, they are making a commitment to achieving positive results. This commitment is what some people refer to as &quot;taking ownership&quot; of a situation. When you take responsibility for a certain function within a company, they are often required to fulfill certain requirements.</p>
<p>When people are responsible, it means that they are aware of and willing to take responsibility for the results of their activities in the domains over which they have been given authority. Work is done in an efficient and effective manner when responsibilities are defined and people are held accountable for their actions. When accountability is expected of everyone, it opens the door to opportunities for positive growth and development. </p>
<h2>Importance of Accountability</h2>
<p>Increased employee engagement is a direct result of increased accountability. It grants people the freedom to make decisions on their own and initiate actions that will lead to the outcomes they seek. Employees should be included in crucial decision-making processes. Organizations should address employee concerns and promote employee initiatives.</p>
<h2>Accountability in the Business Sector</h2>
<p>Responsibility is a crucial part of a business setting in order to have effective and open working relationships. It simply implies that an employee's actions should be assessed on a regular basis in order to offer them some feedback on how they may improve their performance on the job. This will allow the employee to work more efficiently. In addition, the practice of accountability seeks to eliminate instances of carelessness and misconduct in the workplace. </p>
<p>The responsibilities that an individual has at work have a direct bearing on their level of accountability. Any action taken by an employee that falls within the scope of their job responsibilities might result in disciplinary action and/or termination.</p>
<p>This indicates that a corporation is unable to hold a person accountable for engaging in behavior that was not mentioned in their job description. Because their actions have a greater effect on the organization as a whole, senior management has a greater responsibility to be accountable. This indicates that the activities of senior executives have to be evaluated in a more comprehensive manner in order to avoid misconduct and unintended repercussions resulting from erroneous judgments.</p>

<title>Accounting Conservatism</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/accounting-conservatism</url>
<file>accounting-conservatism.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Accounting conservatism is a principle that necessitates the recognition of future expenses and liabilities immediately in a volatile situation rather than future assets and revenues.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accounting Conservatism?</h2>
<p>In accounting, conservatism refers to the concept that in a highly uncertain situation, expenses and liabilities should be recorded immediately while revenues and assets should be recognized when there is a high degree of certainty that they will be obtained.</p>
<p>Conservatism, a principle set by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), does not instruct the accountant to be extremely conservative and bring down the company's revenue to lower levels. An accountant is expected to maintain impartiality and objectivity. However, the concept of conservatism states that transactions should be recorded in a manner that results in a lower amount of profit and assets and/or a higher amount of liabilities and expenses. This is because conservatism favors the less favorable outcome.</p>
<h2>Why Is Accounting Conservatism Used?</h2>
<p>This strategy is used by companies to avoid giving a false impression that they have good fiscal health or integrity. It's possible for accountants to apply accounting conservatism to multiple internal accounting processes. When it comes to fiscal gains, the criteria for recognizing a gain are far more stringent than those for recognizing a loss. </p>
<h2>Pros and Cons of Accounting Conservatism</h2>
<p>As is the case with any other type of accounting procedure, there are pros and cons to consider. Benefits offered by this principle are: </p>
<div>Conservatism lowers the negative impact of volatility significantly, hence improving the brand identity.</div>
<p>Access to funding is made easier by the firm since it provides a clear image of the financial status of the organization.</p>
<p>The accounting approach gives financial analysts the ability to make projections that are both impartial and accurate.</p>
<p>As is the case with all assets, there are some potential drawbacks as well:</p>
<p>It is possible that the projections may end up showing an inaccurate downtrend in terms of finances.</p>
<p>There is an asymmetry in the information.</p>
<p>It may offer an inaccurate future value of the organization.</p>
<h2>Example of Accounting Conservatism </h2>
<p>The rule requires reporting the inventory on the balance sheet at its cost or net realizable value (NRV), whichever is lower. Any related “loss” is reported in the current income statement. </p>
<p>For example, a company has inventory worth $10,000. The current market value of the inventory declined by $2,000. Therefore, it can be sold at $8,000, only if the company spends $3,000 more on the shipment of the goods. </p>
<p>The accountant is required to report the NRV (net realizable value) of $5,000 ($10,000 - $2,000 - $3,000) on the balance sheet and a write-down loss of $5,000 on the income statement (even if the goods have not been sold yet).</p>

<title>Accounting Method</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/accounting-method</url>
<file>accounting-method.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An accounting method is a system of rules applied to determine how and when revenue and expenses are recorded in an organization.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Accounting Method? </h2>
<p>An accounting method is a set of rules and guidelines set by a governing body. It discusses how an organization will record its business transactions in the books of accounts. The two methods available to organizations are cash and accrual methods. </p>
<h2>What Is Single-Entry Accounting/Cash-based Accounting?</h2>
<p>Cash-based accounting implies that a transaction of any revenue or expense will not be passed in the books until money has actually been received or paid. Many businesses prefer it for bookkeeping due to its simplicity. It contributes to the process of measuring the organization's real cash flow. However, in terms of the decision-making process for long-term projects, it does not play a significant part.</p>
<p>When it comes to paying taxes, cash accounting might be beneficial to some types of firms. You have complete control over the timing of transactions since revenue and costs are not recorded until the moment when money is actually transferred.</p>
<h2>What Is Double-Entry Accounting/Accrual Accounting?</h2>
<p>In the accrual method, revenue or expense transactions are recorded when accrued or incurred. It refers to the principles of accounting that are often adhered to by large organizations. </p>
<p>You employ more complex accounts, such as accounts payable, long-term liabilities, current assets and inventory. In this method, revenue is recorded at the moment the transaction takes place, regardless of whether or not the cash has actually been received at that time. You are also required to record all expenses when you receive the bill.</p>
<p>If you want to declare your income using the accrual method for tax reasons, you are required to do so in the year that you earn it, even if you have not yet received the money. In addition, you can deduct costs in the same year that you incurred them, regardless of whether or not you paid for the charges.</p>
<h2>How to Choose an Accounting Method?</h2>
<p>You may use both accounting methods to make a budget. Here are some other things to think about while choosing between the two accounting techniques:</p>
<p>Your bookkeeping requirements as a single company will differ significantly from those of a large corporation. When selecting an accounting technique for your company, bear that in mind.</p>
<p>Although you are running a small business today, do you have any ambitions to develop and expand? If this is the case, you could be better off selecting an accounting approach based on your business's future growth rather than its current size. The decision you make may also be affected by hiring personnel.</p>
<div>You must use accrual accounting if you are a large company or C corporation. It is likely that you are not a small firm if you're generating millions of dollars annually in revenue. The accrual accounting system must also be used by any firm that is publicly traded.</div>
<h2>What Is Modified Cash-Basis Accounting/Hybrid Accounting Method?</h2>
<p>Hybrid accounting, often referred to as modified cash-basis accounting combines elements of accrual-based and cash-based accounting. Typically, accrual is the most difficult technique, whereas cash-basis is considered the easiest one. The modified approach offers business owners who want elements of both cash and accrual accounting a happy medium.</p>
<p>A company may decide to employ the modified cash-basis accounting approach to get a more realistic financial image because other techniques have certain limitations.</p>
<p>The modified cash-basis technique can better balance short-term and long-term accounting information by including elements from both cash-basis and accrual. This way, you can track both short-term elements, like utility bills, and long-term assets, like property.</p>
<p>Double-entry accounting is also used in a modified cash-basis system. Every input into an account in double-entry accounting necessitates the creation of a comparable and opposing entry into a distinct account.</p>

<title>Accounting Token</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Accounting tokens are essentially tokenized credit or debit entries (IOU/UOM), just like any spreadsheet-based accounting system.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Accounting Token?</h2>
<div>Accounting tokens are best understood when you think of blockchain as a “distributed ledger.” They are an alternative to stablecoins, helping businesses to stay compliant. Stablecoins are a regulator's nightmare because they act like cash and can be used anonymously and globally. As a result, many jurisdictions treat stablecoins like the financial products they resemble, heavily regulating their use. </div>
<div>Accounting tokens are essentially tokenized credit or debit entries (IOU/UOM), just like any spreadsheet-based accounting system. They are only for accounting purposes, representing the amount of money owed by the token holder. It is not backed by FIAT like stablecoins, and so cannot be treated as a financial product. This solution works well with a limited number of settlement partners. In fact, with a small enough number, the entire process can be settled on the blockchain, using the token’s smart contract. These accounting tokens don’t have to only represent currency; they can also represent goods or services equaling the amount of the accounted value, not unlike a good old-fashioned coupon. Practically speaking, they work just like coupons. </div>
<div>Thanks to the nature of blockchain technology, this process is also very secure and compliant. Businesses can restrict possible token holders through implementing a KYC/AML process, adding documentation, and keeping the whole process transparent on a public blockchain since that is essentially what these tokens are – credit/debit entries on a distributed ledger. </div>

<title>Accredited Investors</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/accredited-investors</url>
<file>accredited-investors.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An accredited investor is a person or organization that is qualified to participate in financial opportunities that are not legally offered to regular investors.</preview>
<description>
<h2>Who Are Accredited Investors?</h2>
<div>Any person or entity authorized to make investments in securities that are not registered with financial regulatory bodies is considered an accredited investor. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary financial regulatory organization in the United States.</div>
<p>The word &quot;accredited&quot; is the root of the phrase. This suggests that in order to be such an investor, an entity must satisfy the necessary criteria. Investors are considered accredited according to standards based on asset size, net worth and income. The standards for corporate entities are also dependent on governance.</p>
<h2>How to Qualify as an Accredited Investor In the US?</h2>
<p>Different countries have different rules for what constitutes an accredited investor. The regional financial regulator sets the requirements. In the US, the rules are specified by the SEC.</p>
<p>The following criteria must be met in the US:</p>
<p>An individual must have earned more than $200,000 per year during the previous two years ($300,000 combined with the spouse’s earnings). The person must also anticipate receiving the same amount of income or more in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>An organization's assets must be worth at least $5 million for it to be accredited. If the entity's owners are accredited investors, the entity may also be regarded as an accredited investor.</p>
<p>A person must be at least $1 million in net worth at the time of purchase, either alone or jointly (if married). The value of the person's principal house is not factored into the computation of net worth. An accredited investor may also be a general partner, director, or executive officer of the company that issued the unregistered securities.</p>
<p>An organization is not permitted accredited status if it was created specifically to buy unregistered stocks. The US Congress amended the definition of an accredited investor in 2016 to include investment advisers and brokers.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Being An Accredited Investor</h2>
<p>Some benefits of being an accredited investor include:</p>
<p>When a company raises money privately instead of going for public capital markets, this is known as a private placement. They usually offer greater returns than the public markets. Being an authorized investor makes it much simpler to access higher-yield capital markets.</p>
<p>Accredited investors may help startups at any stage of growth, and seed-funding platforms link them with small enterprises whose goals coincide with theirs. </p>
<div>Investment portfolios with little alternatives for diversification stagnate when interest rates increase while just investing in the public markets. With a wider investment opportunity available to accredited investors, they are able to reduce systematic risk and exposure by investing in non-correlated alternative assets and debt instruments.</div>

<title>Accretion (of a Discount)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/accretion-of-a-discount</url>
<file>accretion-of-a-discount.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Accretion of a discount refers to the gain that is generated from the difference between the discounted purchase price and the face value of an asset.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accretion (of a Discount)?</h2>
<p>The gain an investor makes after purchasing assets at a discount is referred to as an accretion (of a discount). The investor progressively makes money on the difference between the discounted purchase price and the bond's face value by keeping the bond until it matures.</p>
<p>In corporate finance, accretion is the value that you produce when you merge with or acquire another company. The value of your stockholders' shares rises, as a result, raising your earnings per share (EPS).</p>
<h2>How to Calculate Accretion of a Discount?</h2>
<p>When you purchase a bond for a price less than its face value, it is known as accumulation and it puts more money in your pocket.</p>
<p>But how does it work?</p>
<p>Let’s assume you bought a discounted bond for $800 but its face value is $1,000. You keep the bond until the maturity date. When the bond matures, you receive interest on top of the difference between the face value and the discounted price. In other words, if you bought it only for $800, you gained $200. Additionally, you got the interest on the bond's $1,000 face value.</p>
<p>When a bond reaches maturity, interest is paid out either yearly or all at once. Either the straight-line technique or the constant-yield method can be used to determine the bond's accretion. Let's check out the two calculation techniques.</p>
<p>Let's assume that the maturity of your bond is after five years. The bond's face value was $500 more than what you paid for it.</p>
<p>There are 20 financial periods left till the bond matures because the bond issuer reports its financial standing every quarter. You may observe a $25 addition every quarter until the bond matures (if you divide the discount [$500] by the length of financial periods [20]). In other words, until the bond's maturity date, the value of your amount will rise by $25 every three months.</p>
<p>The bond's value rises as it gets closer to its maturity date using the constant yield approach. This implies that some financial periods, particularly those approaching the conclusion of the bond's life, will show greater benefits.</p>
<p>The accretion of discount can be calculated using the following formula: </p>
<p>Accretion Amount= Purchase Basis x (YTM/Accrual periods per year) - Coupon Interest.</p>
<p>Using this approach, you must first get the value of yield to maturity (YTM) in order to calculate the accretion of discount. The earnings on a bond that is held to maturity are known as YTM. Keep in mind that the profit's compounding frequency has a significant impact on YTM. </p>
<p>At the maturity date, both bond accretion computations will result in a profit for you. The constant yield strategy, however, enables the bond issuer to get additional time before they must raise the bond's value.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Accrual accounting is a method in which revenues and expenses are recorded in the year in which they occurred instead of when the payment is actually made.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accrual Accounting?</h2>
<div>Accrual accounting is a method in which a transaction - both revenue and expense - should be recorded when it occurs even if the cash hasn’t been received/paid. It means that revenue should be recorded when the goods or services are delivered even if the customer has not paid yet. It is done with the assumption that the customer will pay in the near future, and is recorded as an asset until the customer pays. Expenses are also recorded in the same way, which means that if the business consumes any good or service on an accrual basis, the business must record the transaction at the date of the purchase and not on the date of the payment. This is done due to the accounting concept of accruals as the transaction was carried out for the period when it occurred and not when the payment does, this results in the accounts representing an accurate and fair view.</div>
<h2>What Is an Accrued Revenue?</h2>
<div>Accrued revenue is commonly recorded when a customer makes a purchase and pays for the same on a later date. The accountant makes a debit entry in the receivables account on the date at which the goods or services are provided. In contrast, the sales account is credited. On the date when the payment is received, the accountant debits cash/bank account and credits the sales receivables account. </div>
<h2>What Is an Accrued Expense?</h2>
<p>An accrued expense usually occurs when a business purchases raw materials for the production of its goods on a credit basis. This is when the business receives the product before the payment. </p>
<p>On the day the raw materials are received, the business credits the trade payables account and debits the purchases account. When it pays for the raw materials, the trade payables account is debited to reduce the balance and the bank/cash account is credited.</p>

<file>accrue.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The accumulated interest, income or expenses over a period of time is known as an accrual.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accrue?</h2>
<p>In simple terms, an accrual is the accumulated amount built up to be paid or received, usually in the form of income, interest, or expense that occurred in the past. An example would be a business sending goods or services to a customer in the month of December but receiving payment in the month of February, thus the amount owed by the customer to the business is accrued. </p>
<p>An accrual generally occurs in a business when sales are made on a credit basis to customers or the raw material is purchased on credit from a supplier.</p>
<h2>Accruals in Accounting</h2>
<p>The accounting concept of accruals states that the revenues and expenses that business records should be recognized in the accounting period in which the transactions occur instead of when the payment is received or paid. </p>
<p>Let’s take an example of a business that just sold goods to a customer on a credit basis. This transaction should be recorded as a sale even though payment was not received immediately. When the payment is received, an entry to reduce trade receivables and increase the cash or bank balance will be made. Therefore, we record the sale as accrued on the date the customer received the goods or services instead of when the customer actually paid for the goods or services provided by the business. </p>
<h2>How Are Accruals Treated in Accounts?</h2>
<p>Accruals are treated as either an asset or a liability-</p>
<div>Assets: An accrual is treated as an asset when the business sells goods or services on credit to a customer and does not expect payment at the time of delivery. This is often seen in cases where clients’ liquidity is low and they cannot pay full amounts instantly and may require some time due to a slow receivable period. This is when the business adds the balance owed by the customer to the trade receivables account.</div>
<p>Liabilities: An accrual is recorded as a liability when the business purchases goods or services from its suppliers or even accrued rent for its premises. Such a transaction is an accrual when the business takes delivery of the goods or services but pays the suppliers on a later date. It records an accrued liability by adding the amount owed to the supplier to the trade payables account which is the account used when the business purchases goods or services related to their business activities.</p>
<p>When a transaction takes place, income or expense, it is recorded in the balance sheet as well as the income statement. The balance from the balance sheet is written off once the amount due is paid or received, according to the nature of the transaction.</p>

<title>Accrued Income</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/accrued-income</url>
<file>accrued-income.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Accrued income is the type of income that has been earned but is yet to be received, it is in accordance with the accrual method of accounting.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accrued Income?</h2>
<p>Accrued income falls under the accrual method of accounting because the income has been earned by the company on a particular date however it has not been received on the same date. Therefore, such income is treated in a different way than regular income. This method of accounting states that income earned in an accounting period should be realized in the same accounting period and not in a separate accounting period. This is done to match the costs with the incomes of the same period.</p>
<h2>Accounting Treatment</h2>
<p>Due to the fact that accrued income applies to the same accounting period it is earned in, we must record it in the same period. To do so, we debit the accrued income account and credit the income account. The balance from the accrued income account is written off once the income is actually received by debiting the bank or cash account and crediting the income accrued account.</p>
<h2>Accrued Income vs Accrued Revenue</h2>
<p>Accrued income and accrued revenue are often interpreted as the same, however, this is not the case as accrued income is often observed as the income earned through investing activities whilst accrued revenue is the amount generated from general business activities that involve selling goods or services.</p>

<title>Accrued Interest</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/accrued-interest</url>
<file>accrued-interest.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Accrued interest is the amount of interest owed by or owed to a company on a specified date on a debt or a financial obligation that is yet to be received or paid.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Accrued Interest?</h2>
<div>Accrued interest is the accumulated amount of interest that a company has yet to pay or receive, however, it has already been recorded in the books of accounts. When a company is a lender, it is known as interest income; when the company is the borrower, it is known as an interest expense. These items are recorded in the balance sheet as well as the income statement as interest payable or interest receivable. This approach is only followed under the accrual method of accounting.</div>
<div>Accrued interest is also commonly used while accounting for accumulated interest in bonds, the interest usually builds up between the two date interest payment dates by the issuer.</div>
<h2>Difference Between Accrued Interest and Regular Interest</h2>
<p>There is only one crucial differentiator between accrued and regular interest and that is the time of the interest payment. If the interest was paid immediately after it was incurred, it will be recorded normally in the books of accounts. However, if the borrower does not pay immediately then the interest will be accrued.</p>
<h2>Accounting Treatment for Accrued Interest</h2>
<p></p>
<div>When interest is not paid immediately the accounting treatment changes as the interest becomes an asset or liability depending on the scenario. For example, if a company owes interest, then there will be an entry into the interest payable account in the balance sheet as a liability. The company will also record it as an expense since the expense was for the period when it was incurred and not when it was paid. </div>
<p>When the interest is paid to the lender by the company, the amount will be reduced from the cash or bank balance and will set off the balance in the interest payable account.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Taking the same scenario as an example, the accounting treatment would the exact opposite if the company was the lender. On the date at which the interest income is to be received, an entry into the interest income would be carried out and the accumulated amount of the interest owed to the company will be recorded as an asset in the balance sheet under the interest receivable account.</p>
<div>The accounting treatment for regular interest received on the other hand is fairly simple, the bank or cash accounts get debited whilst the interest receivable account gets credited. If an interest expense occurs then the interest payable account gets debited whilst the cash or bank accounts get credited.</div>

<file>accrued-liabilities.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Accrued liabilities are financial obligations that have not been credited from the company's bank accounts as invoices for these obligations have not been received.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Accrued Liabilities?</h2>
<p>Accrued liabilities are incurred when a business purchases goods and services on credit due to which they do not receive invoices at the time of the purchase. They are expected to pay the amounts due in the future. When a company purchases goods or services on a credit basis, its bank or cash accounts do not get affected. The balance is allocated to the trade payables account which is reflected in the balance sheet. The purchase account is debited as it does in a normal cash purchase. </p>
<div>Accrued liabilities may also be caused because of accrued expenses, such as pending electricity bills. This is when the business has to record the expense for the period when it was incurred rather than the accounting period in which it was paid.</div>
<p>These transactions are usually recorded in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet and the balance is then written off once the company pays for the goods or services purchased.</p>
<p>The transaction is recorded on the date the goods or services are received as the company has reaped the benefits at the time of the purchase, thus the transaction must be recorded at the time the goods or services are received. This is done due to the accounting method of accruals which follows the matching concept.</p>
<h2>When Are the Accrued Liabilities Written Off?</h2>
<p>Accrued liabilities are only written off once the business pays the accrued balance. It is credited from the bank or cash balance and reduces the balance in the liability’s account. </p>
<h2>Types of Accrued Liabilities</h2>
<p>There are two types of accrued liabilities that a business can incur:</p>
<p>These liabilities are incurred due to a company's day-to-day activities such as purchasing raw materials. These are incurred multiple times in a year and are recorded in the trade payables account or other payables account. A few examples would be raw materials bought on credit or wages accrued to employees.</p>
<p>Non-routine liabilities occur on very few occasions. These liabilities are related to the non-operating duties of the company. </p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Accrued revenue rises when a business records sales without receiving payment for the goods or services sold as they do not invoice the customer at the time of the sale.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accrued Revenue?</h2>
<div>Accrued revenue in simple terms, is when a business sells its goods or services to the customer but does not expect payment at the time of delivery but in the near future. When an accrued revenue occurs, the company has to note two important dates - the first being the date at which the goods or services are provided to the customer. On this date, the business can record the sale in the sales account and can allocate the balance to the trade receivables account. Once the payment is received by the business, an entry in the cash/bank account is made and the amount previously added to the trade receivables account is then credited. </div>
<h2>Advantages of Accepting Accrued Sales</h2>
<div>Many businesses accept credit sales mainly due to the fact that they may lose out on a lot of potential sales as numerous businesses look to buy on credit. This is because they do not have to pay instantly and thus get to deploy their capital in other places. Moreover, in several industries, the payment period is generally slow due to a number of reasons, such as low liquidity. Therefore, many businesses prefer to purchase goods and services on credit and many companies have to offer credit sales so that they do not lose such customers. Accrued revenue also helps the business analyze the long-term growth and profitability. </div>
<h2>Accrued Revenue vs Regular Revenue</h2>
<p>The only difference between accrued revenue and regular revenue is if the payment by the customer was done immediately. If the payment was done immediately the accounting treatment would be fairly simple: The bank or cash account would be debited whilst the sales account would be credited. If the payment was not done immediately then there would be two entries:</p>
<p>The first entry would be done at the time of the sale. This is due to two accounting principles which are revenue recognition and matching principle. Therefore, trade receivables account is debited and the sales account is credited. The sales balance would be seen in the income statement whilst the trade receivable balance would be seen in the balance sheet as an asset.</p>
<p>The second entry would be recorded at the time of receiving payment from the customer. This is when the bank or cash account would be debited and the balance in the trade receivable account would be written off by crediting the account.</p>

<title>Accumulation Phase</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/accumulation-phase</url>
<file>accumulation-phase.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The accumulation phase is a stage in the market cycle right after a downtrend, where the institutional investors start buying in tranches, signaling a positive uptrend soon.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Accumulation Phase?</h2>
<div>The Accumulation phase is the stage at which the institutions anticipate great potential in undervalued security and start building up their position. They cannot buy their entire position in one single order as the volumes of the security would shoot up, resulting in the market noticing unusual activity. Therefore, they buy these securities in tranches to avoid getting detected by the market participants. At this stage, the security has been under a strong downtrend, triggering a bearish sentiment around it causing the institutions to be able to buy the security at a very attractive price.</div>
<h2>What Is a Market Cycle?</h2>
<p>Originally derived from the stock markets, market cycles are repetitive patterns or trends that are formed in financial markets.  There are four main stages that are part of a regular market cycle: accumulation, run-up, distribution and run-down. These four cycles are always seen in the same sequence, which is why traders aim to detect stocks in the accumulation phase to be able to buy the asset before it starts its uptrend. </p>
<div>During the accumulation phase, the selling volumes are almost flattened as the majority of the sellers have exited their positions. Due to the bearish sentiment, there is a lack of buyers that makes the asset trade sideways, and this is when institutional investors step in. They take advantage of the sideways trend and start accumulating the security in small loads without indicating to the market - it helps keep the price at a discounted level. </div>
<p>It is important to note that an accumulation phase can be mistaken for a distribution phase, which is seen right before the decline in a stock. This is why investors should be cautious and make sure they research properly and wait for a clear breakout as a confirmation.</p>
<h2>Trading the Accumulation Phase</h2>
<div>The accumulation phase tends to form clear swing highs and swing lows. The only downside of swing trading security in the accumulation phase is that the range might be too tight, causing the profits to be limited.</div>
<p>Check out our guide on scalping vs swing trading!</p>
<p> The accumulation phase has no set time period as to when it could break out and start the run-up phase. This attracts value investors as they have the patience that traders may not since the accumulation phase usually goes on for over a year!</p>
<p>Traders prefer to add securities that are in the accumulation phase to their watchlists as they would enter once a clear breakout occurs. They prefer doing so as securities may even spend multiple years in the accumulation phase. Therefore, rather than parking their capital in a sideways trend, traders look for better opportunities. </p>
<h2>Example of Accumulation Phase</h2>
<p>In the weekly chart of Spotify above, we can clearly see the accumulation phase.</p>
<p>The accumulation phase started after a strong downtrend, which took Spotify from $195 to $100 - the level where the market bottomed out. At this point, investors started accumulating their position in Spotify. </p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, the accumulation phase can last for a longer period as well which was the case for Spotify as it consolidated from 2019 to mid-2020. Traders would have stepped in once a breakout was seen in May 2020, however, they would have had to buy Spotify at a higher price of $200 as compared to value investors who got to accumulate near $100 to $140. </p>

<file>accumulation-distribution-indicator.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The accumulation/distribution indicator determines the supply and demand level of a stock/asset/cryptocurrency by multiplying the closing price of a specific period with volume.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Accumulation/Distribution Indicator?</h2>
<div>The accumulation/distribution indicator is a price and volume-based indicator that determines the (current &amp; future) trend of an asset. It does this by examining the relationship between the stock’s closing price and its volume flow. The term “accumulation” denotes the level of buying (demand), and “distribution” denotes the level of selling (supply) of an asset. </div>
<div>The accumulation/distribution indicator can be termed as a momentum indicator that is used by traders to spot tops and bottoms of asset charts to anticipate trend reversals.</div>
<div>It accomplishes this by displaying the relationship between an asset's price and the proportion of buyers and sellers in that market. Traders decide if the market is bullish (increasing) or bearish (decreasing). They do it by looking for a divergence in the price and the indicator.</div>
<div>After a sharp decline in the price of an asset, any increase might suggest that the demand is starting to increase, which means that sellers are losing influence and buyers are gaining power. The accumulation/distribution line will begin to move in the opposite direction of the price, indicating a possible reversal.</div>
<div>Here’s how you can calculate the accumulation/distribution indicator (A/D):</div>
<p>The formula for Money Flow multiplier:</p>
<div>(Closing Price - Low price of the period) - (High price of the period - Closing Price) / (High price of the period - Low price of the period)</div>
<div>Money Flow Volume = Money Flow Multiplier × Period Volume ​</div>
<div>A/D = Previous A/D + Money Flow Volume (current)</div>
<p>The accumulation/distribution line demonstrates how supply and demand influences pricing. Price fluctuations might cause the A/D line to move in the same way or the other direction.</p>
<div>The ADL is a tool that can be used to evaluate price patterns and possibly predict future reversals. When the price of an asset falls while the ADL rises, this indicates that purchasing pressure is there, and the price of the asset may reverse to the upside.</div>
<div>Trading gaps are not taken into account by the A/D line. As a result, when these gaps arise, they may not be taken into account at all by the A/D indicator. If a stock's price rises but then falls around the middle, the gap will be disregarded. The reason for this is that the A/D line is calculated using closing prices. It might be difficult to identify small variations in volume flows at times. A downtrend's pace of change may get slow, but this would be difficult to see until the ADL begins to rise.</div>

<title>Adaptive State Sharding</title>

<file>adaptive-state-sharding.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Used by Elrond, Adaptive State Sharding is an approach that combines all types of sharding into one to improve communication and performance.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Adaptive State Sharding?</h2>
<div>There are three types of sharding: state, transactions, and network. Elrond’s approach to Blockchain sharding involves the combination of all three types – and is given the name of adaptive state sharding. Combining the advantages of all three types of sharding results in an optimal mechanism. The result enables parallel processing – improves communication inside the shards – and eventually enhances performance.</div>
<div>The current problem in blockchain technology is that it fails to properly scale for certain applications, like banking, supply chain management, and big data analytics. Elrond’s adaptive state sharding gives a mechanism for blockchain that can improve its performance in terms of throughput and scalability.</div>
<p>To better understand adaptive state sharding, it’s essential to understand sharding first.</p>
<div>Sharding is a horizontal partitioning of data in a database or search engine. The word shard means split and refers to splitting data into smaller chunks that can be stored on different machines, allowing horizontal scaling. Like transaction processing and block processing, sharding has been possible for quite some time, but not at the scale it needs to be at for blockchain adoption. With the advent of blockchain technology and smart contracts, we have a real use case of sharding that can be used to break up transactions, blocks, and other relevant data into smaller pieces that can be processed by nodes with limited resources.</div>
<p>Adaptive sharding is a database partitioning technique that allows horizontal scaling of databases by automatically moving data across servers as the load on the system increases or decreases. </p>
<p>At the network level, sharding occurs to distribute nodes into segments. It happens at the transaction level while all nodes together retain the entirety of the blockchain. Another sharding that takes place is at the state level. This leads to the processing and verification of more transactions at the same time. </p>
<p>The dynamic adaptive state sharding model allows for adaptation to an increasing or decreasing number of nodes without compromising the decentralization and security of the network. </p>
<p>Elrond has done well by demonstrating a new approach to sharding, which increases security and throughput and reduces delays. Its approach has the potential, but only time will tell how much adaptive state sharding helps solve the blockchain systems scalability problem. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Crypto &quot;Address&quot;?</h2>
<p>A crypto address is a string of characters that represents a wallet that can send and receive cryptocurrency. It is akin to a real-life address, email or website. Every address is unique and denotes the location of a wallet on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Most blockchain addresses are difficult for humans to read, as they take the form of long random strings of letters and numbers. However, they are all unique, which poses no problems for computer networks.</p>
<p>Blockchain addresses are public and you can utilize a blockchain explorer to see the transactions in and out of an address. You can also see the amount of assets that the address has. The only exception are the privacy-based blockchains (eg. Monero and Grin).</p>
<p>Even though the addresses are public, most of the addresses are anonymous (or rather, pseudonymous) as the person owning the address does not usually have their real name associated with it. However, there are cases where addresses and the person or entity behind them is known: this is usually the case for exchanges and token project owners or founders.</p>

<preview>Adoption curve indicates the pace of adoption of a new technology by people. It may also involve segregation of the target audience to understand the market's willingness.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Adoption Curve?</h2>
<div>Adoption curves are an illustration of the stages in which the adoption of a technological innovation grows in a market. </div>
<p>When something new comes into the market, whether it is a new model of car or an entirely new technological tool/concept, it is not adopted all at once. At first, only a few people give it a try before it gets to the masses.</p>
<p>Take cell phones as an example: as use cases for cell phones grew, the support network for them also grew. As they began to be adopted by more people, each generation of adopters paved the way for the next one to make the technology better. </p>
<p>This process of adoption can be observed across a range of markets where different sectors of a market come on board with a new product or technology at different stages and for different reasons.</p>
<div>Blockchain technology is an excellent example of the adoption curve. Cryptographically secured chains of blocks were introduced in the early 1990s, but it was 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto released a whitepaper establishing the model for a blockchain. In 2009, the first genesis chain was mined. </div>
<div>It is slowly being adopted since then, and today, more than 80% of total Bitcoins have been mined and more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies have been launched on blockchains following the launch of the inaugural BTC.</div>

<preview>A blockchain network that works on a hybrid consensus approach; both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Aeternity Blockchain?</h2>
<div>Aeternity blockchain is a hybrid PoW/PoS protocol that aims at providing excellent efficiency, transparent governance, and solution to scalability issues. The system will enable millions of users to leverage the best features of decentralized architectures, including the security of public blockchains and the efficiency of private blockchains.</div>
<div>The Aeternity blockchain is in fact a hybrid between Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. </div>
<p>Aeternity's hybrid approach allows smart contracts and oracles to process information off-chain for increased privacy, faster transactions, and lower fees.</p>
<p>One of the major aims of Aeternity is to address some of the blockchain scalability and privacy issues. It is being built by a team led by Yanislav Malahov, who has been involved in blockchain technology since the early days and was one of the original contributors to Ethereum.</p>
<div>Aeternity is designed to improve on some of the limitations in existing blockchains, particularly related to scalability. To do this, it uses a hybrid approach that combines features from both on-chain and off-chain solutions. The team behind the project also plans to implement new features that will improve scalability, privacy, and governance.</div>
<div>Aeternity is one of the blockchain networks that use Decentralized Oracle Machine. A decentralized oracle is a piece of software that acts as an interface between the blockchain and the world outside it. Oracles are needed for smart contracts to interact with other networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Because of the nature of blockchains, smart contracts typically cannot access data from sources outside the blockchain.</div>
<p>Oracles are used to retrieve real-world data and feed it directly into smart contracts on the blockchain (e.g., information about weather conditions, flight times, sporting event results). They retrieve external data and submit it to a smart contract in the form of a transaction. In this way, they act as a bridge between off-chain data and on-chain applications.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to bet on a sporting event using a smart contract, you can use the oracle to automatically trigger payment when that event is over. The oracle would then go out into the real world, get the result of the game, and feed that information back into the contract so that it can release funds accordingly.</p>
<p>Aeternity’s rapid popularity is mostly due to its mobile-first design approach. Since it is using cutting-edge solutions to deal with blockchain scalability issues, it is becoming an aspiring network for dApps developers. </p>

<div>It is calculated using the formula C + I + G + (X-M), where C is personal consumption, I is investment, G is government purchases, X is exports, and M is imports. Jointly, they make up what is known as the gross domestic product (GDP).</div>
<h2>Factors Determining Aggregate Demand, According to Keynesians</h2>
<p>According to Keynesian economists, if a firm desires to achieve high levels of investments, and consumers are eager to spend instead of saving, then aggregate demand will increase. However, if consumers are anxious and opt to save while firms are reluctant to invest, aggregate demand will be low.</p>
<p>In general, Keynesians see the flow of spending in terms of leakages and injections. Investment, government spending and exports inject demand. Savings, taxes, and important leak demand from the economy. When demand is low, the government can correct it by injecting more spending or reducing leakage by cutting taxes.</p>
<h2>Factors Affecting Aggregate Demand, According to Monetarists</h2>
<div>Monetarists view aggregate demand as determined by the amount of money in circulation. According to monetarists, MV = PY, where M is the amount of money, V is the velocity of circulation of money, and P is the aggregate price of output, Y is the aggregate output or real GDP.</div>
<p>The idea behind monetarists’ view is that households use the money to make purchases. The gross value of goods and services purchased is the nominal GDP or PY. At any point in time, households and businesses hold some cash. The velocity is a measure of how fast they turn the cash over to buy more services and goods. Velocity depends on habits and technology, and what is defined as money.</p>
<p>One key advantage of monetarists is that it introduces a price level into aggregate demand. Taking the supply of money and velocity as given, the demand for real output will be higher if the price level is lower. It means that it is possible to draw a downward-sloping aggregate demand curve just like the demand curve drawn in microeconomics.</p>
<h2>The IS-LM Model</h2>
<p>A synthesis called IS-LM was created in 1937. For a few decades, it was quite popular. In IS-LM, both money supply and the saving-investment balance impact aggregate demand. It introduces the interest rate as a determinant of money velocity. If the government increases spending, which is an injection, it increases interest rates, which increases the velocity of money, so that nominal GDP increases.</p>

<title>Aggressive Investment Strategy</title>

<file>aggressive-investment-strategy.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An aggressive investment strategy is a high-risk investment strategy that aims to generate the maximum possible returns in financial markets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Aggressive Investment Strategy?</h2>
<div>An aggressive investment strategy refers to a portfolio management style where the goal is to maximize returns by taking an unusually high level of risk. Strategies that aim to achieve higher than average returns often emphasize capital appreciation as the primary objective instead of income or safety of principal. This strategy usually entails a massive weighting in high-risk assets, with little to no allocation in low-risk assets.</div>
<h2>Aggressive Investment Strategy Methods</h2>
<p>There are plenty of ways for an investor to pursue an aggressive investment strategy. Below are some of the most common.</p>
<p>Crypto or stocks with a small-cap provide the potential to appreciate more in value than large-cap assets. Prices can compound to over twice the original price if the business model succeeds and achieves substantial revenue growth. The risk here is that investors can lose their investment if the business fails. </p>
<p>Investing in emerging markets can quickly compound as the economies of such countries grow. The risk is that there might be a lack of quality institutions and governance in these countries. As a result, there is high regulatory and political risk.</p>
<div>High-yield bonds are a great source of yield for investors looking for huge returns and regular cash flow. These are high coupon bonds with below-investment-grade credit ratings, often called junk bonds. The risk is that the issuing company could go bust, rendering the bonds worthless.</div>
<div>Options can be used to speculate on movement in the prices of securities. They are built as non-linear securities, which can offer a constant source of income in times of low volatility or generate huge payoffs during huge market movements. The risk is that investors could lose more than they make over time on a single market move that goes against their position.</div>
<div>Private investments or private funding rounds are preferred by accredited investors. If successful, the business could compound rapidly. However, there is always a risk associated that startups may fail even before launching their products.</div>
<h2>How to Reduce Risk?</h2>
<div>While this strategy depends on the risk-taking attitude of investors, one should only focus on taking calculated risks. For instance, when investing in the crypto markets, one may prefer to invest only in Bitcoin and dino alts that are more stable than memecoins that offer high risk/reward. Another means of reducing risk is using a trusted exchange such as Binance, which has reasonable security measures in place to protect users’ funds.</div>

<preview>If data cannot be accessed, then it cannot be infected or corrupted — this is the concept of an air gap.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Air Gap?</h2>
<p>The concept of an air gap refers to the following: if data cannot be accessed, then it cannot be infected or corrupted. Within the IT industry, this is typically implemented as a duplicate copy of production data on a secondary storage system, which is offline, and as such is not connected to any production or public networks. However, in practice, this extra data copy is protected from attacks alongside corruption as long as the gap is maintained.</p>
<p>Companies will typically rely on this air gap data as a copy of the last resort. The air gap typically augments existing backups, recovery and disaster recovery strategies with the intention of providing an added layer of protection.</p>
<p>However, alongside this, you also have the benefit of enabling rapid recovery in the case of a large attack.</p>
<p>Many vendors use this as a strategy to entice customers to purchase twice as much hardware, one for production and another for the air gap, which can lead to a higher level of costs. This high cost has limited the adoption when it comes to traditional hardware air gap strategies.</p>
<p>When it comes to the types of air gaps, you have an array-based air gap, a backup-based air gap and an object-based air gap.</p>

<preview>A marketing campaign that distributes a specific cryptocurrency or token to an audience.</preview>
<description>
<p>An &quot;airdrop&quot; refers to a method of distributing cryptocurrency to the public, via the fact that they own certain other tokens or wallets on a particular blockchain. This is usually done for marketing purposes to incentivize the holding of other tokens or induce them to become a participant in the blockchain network.</p>
<p>Airdrops usually work by requiring users to hold a certain amount of tokens in a publicly discoverable wallet at a predetermined time (snapshot time). The token project conducting the airdrop would then use the snapshot to distribute the airdrop tokens accordingly.</p>
<p>The effect of airdrops allow users to diversify their cryptocurrency holdings, spread awareness of the airdropped token and earn an effective dividend (of their previous holdings). Most airdrop campaigns run with mechanics such as receiving coins or tokens in exchange for simple tasks like sharing news, referring friends or downloading an app.</p>

<preview>Airnode is an oracle node and API blockchain gateway that is readily deployed by API providers who want to engage in the API3 blockchain protocol and put their data feeds on-chain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Airnode?</h2>
<div>The decentralized web, or Web 3.0, is the internet's next incarnation. It revolutionizes how the world transfers assets with the use of blockchain. </div>
<div>Since the advent of the internet, Web 3.0 has had the most significant growth potential for organizations. Airnode offers a simple way to get started with this technology. It is an open-source Web3-API middleware that allows any web API to be easily connected to a blockchain application.</div>
<div>Decentralization is the core of Web3 security that has become an issue for API providers. Smart contracts are unable to link directly to APIs that provide access to real-world data and services. Oracles act as a bridge between blockchains and the real world. In this game, Airnode works as the API economy's Web3 oracle solution. It is a maintenance-free, serverless platform that links any web API to any blockchain application. Traditional oracles require the interference of a third party. Airnode eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary.</div>
<div>For connecting firms to the blockchain, third-party oracles demand substantial fees. With Airnode, any business can directly link to blockchain apps while keeping 100% revenue. It is a free and open-source platform that ensures that a user’s connectivity to the blockchain always remains under their control.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Algo-Trading (Algorithmic Trading)?</h2>
<p>Algo-trading, also known as algorithmic trading, is an automated trading system where buy and sell orders are placed according to the rules of a computer program or algorithm. The algorithm may be configured to consider price, but it may also look at other factors such as timing and volume. As soon as the market conditions fulfill the criteria of the algorithm, the alga-trading software will place a buy or sell order accordingly. </p>
<p>A simple example could be the following:</p>
<p>However, in reality, algo-trading involves many more complex rules and conditions to build a formula for profitable trading. </p>
<p>There are many reasons why traders use algo-trading — it offers the opportunity for faster and more frequent trading across an entire portfolio that wouldn’t be possible with manual orders. Because orders are instant, algo-trading secures the best prices and reduces the risk of slippage. Algorithmic trading takes the human element out of the equation, reducing the risk of mistakes or emotional reactions to market conditions. </p>
<p>On a macro level, algo-trading creates more liquid markets thanks to a higher order frequency. It also makes markets more predictable because algorithms are programmed to respond to emerging conditions. </p>
<p>Although algo-trading is used across many markets, it offers even more benefits in the 24/7 cryptocurrency markets, where traders risk missing opportunities or incurring loss risks while they’re asleep. Therefore, even those who prefer manual trading can use algo-trading as a failsafe for when they’re away from their screens. </p>
<p>Algo-trading can be suitable for a wide range of trading strategies. Arbitrageurs who rely on incremental price differences can use an algorithm to ensure order efficiency. Short-term traders and scalpers who aim to capture profits from smaller market movements use algo-trading to ensure they can execute at a high enough frequency to be profitable, and eliminate the risk of chasing losses. Market makers also use algo-trading to ensure that there’s sufficient depth of liquidity in the market. </p>
<p>Traders also use algo-trading for backtesting a particular strategy in order to check if it’s able to return a consistent profit. </p>
<p>There are some risks with algo-trading, particularly around issues such as system downtime or network outages. Algorithms are also programmed by humans, so they can be subject to human errors, meaning that backtesting is critical to ensure the algorithm behaves as expected. </p>
<p>Finally, an algorithm will always do exactly what it’s programmed to do and cannot account for unanticipated “black swan” events that may call for a more human intervention and mitigating actions. </p>

<preview>A process or set of rules to be followed in problem-solving or calculation operations, usually by a computer.</preview>
<description>
<p>An algorithm, often dubbed an algo, can be defined as a set of rules outlined to solve a problem. </p>
<p>The order of instructions is extremely important in algorithms.</p>
<p>Algorithms are used by every single computer device to solve problems. </p>
<p>Algo trading is the process by which automatic trading takes place. Algo trading uses a computer program to buy or sell securities. </p>
<p>Algorithms save much time. It allows workers to be more productive and focused, as well as prioritize other tasks. </p>
<p>Hence algorithms can help corporations achieve massive cost savings. </p>
<p>Financial companies use algorithms in several areas. Some of these include stock trading, loan pricing and asset-liability management to name a few. </p>
<p>Algo trading is also used to determine the timing and quantity of stock orders. Algo trading also determines how stock orders are priced. </p>
<p>Algorithms do much of the laborious tasks which people would have had to otherwise do manually. </p>
<p>There are several types of different algorithms. For example, mean revision algorithms examine short-term prices over long-term average prices. </p>
<p>If a price exceeds its long-term average, traders may be wishing to sell the stock and profit from the situation. </p>
<p>Algorithms are particularly useful in setting instructions to automatically buy crypto if a certain price threshold is met. </p>
<p>For example, a trader can set instructions to buy X amount of crypto if the moving average reaches a certain level. </p>
<p>Several factors are considered by sophisticated algorithms when deciding whether to buy or sell. </p>
<p>A more complicated algorithm will have the ability to hold more data to make buying and selling decisions. </p>
<p>In some cases, several algorithms can be used to tackle one single problem. </p>

<title>Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs)</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs) automatically control the supply of algorithmic stablecoins while improving scalability, decentralization, and transparency.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Algorithmic Market Operations (AMOs)?</h2>
<div>Our understanding of traditional stablecoines is relatively simple. The most common types are fully collateralized stablecoins, which are backed by either fiat, crypto or on-chain tokens that can be redeemed or swapped. An example of a collateralized stablecoin is Tether (USDT), which is the most used stablecoin with a market value of more than $60 billion as of July 2021. </div>
<div>Unlike Tether — which manually mints or burns to increase or decrease its supply — algorithmic stablecoins automatically rely on algorithmic market operation modules (AMOs) to control supply. These are beneficial to the system as they enable scalability, in addition to enhancing decentralization and transparency. </div>
<div>By providing an AMO solution, a stablecoin is more likely to achieve the growth and size required for adoption. AMOs also remove the need for a centralized team to make in-house decisions, as that task will then lie primarily with smart contracts. In turn, this reduces the risk of human error and manipulation.</div>
<p>Every AMO has four properties:</p>
<p>1. Decollateralization: decreasing the collateral ratio;</p>
<p>2. Market operations: this part of the strategy doesn’t change the collateral ratio;</p>
<p>3. Recollateralization: increasing the collateral ratio;</p>
<p>4. FXS1559: the precise amount of FXS that can be burned and still leave profits above the targeted collateral ratio.</p>
<div>In order to keep the stablecoin “stable,” if its price ever gets above its stable peg, the collateral ratio is lowered, the supply expands as it normally does and the AMO controllers continue to run. </div>
<div>On the other hand, if the collateral ratio becomes so low that the stablecoin loses its peg, the AMO will be able to utilize the predefined recollateralization operation to increase the collateral ratio up again.</div>
<p>Because AMOs can be described as a “mechanism-in-a-box,” it's possible for anyone to build an AMO, as long as they follow the specifications.</p>
<div>Using complex algorithms in their smart contracts or algorithmic operated market controllers (AMOs), these types of stablecoins can increase or decrease their token’s circulating supply. This makes the stablecoin capital efficient as it issues additional coins when the price rises and burns them off if its value drops. It also removes the need for collateral backing. Examples of algorithmic stablecoins include Basis Cash and Empty Set Dollar.</div>

<preview>An algorithmic stablecoin actually uses an algorithm underneath, which can issue more coins when its price increases and buy them off the market when the price falls.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Algorithmic Stablecoin?</h2>
<p>An algorithmic stablecoin is designed to achieve price stability as well as balance the circulating supply of an asset by being pegged to a reserve asset such as the U.S. dollar, for example, gold or any foreign currency.</p>
<p>In other words, an algorithmic stablecoin actually uses an algorithm underneath, which can issue more coins when its price increases and buy them off the market when the price falls.</p>
<p>These coins grant traders the comfort of receiving many of the benefits of crypto assets such as ETH and BTC, without the risk of too much price volatility.</p>
<div>When we look at the history of algorithmic stablecoins, 2013 was the first instance where they were launched on the Bitshare blockchains.
The longest-running algorithmic stablecoin is currently Ampleforth (AMPL).</div>
<p>An algorithmic stablecoin is a representation of what true decentralization looks like, without any regulatory bodies to maintain or watch over the proceedings, as the code is what is responsible for both the supply as well as the demand, alongside the target price.</p>
<p>These foundational benefits offer a scalable solution that is not actually offered by any other set on the market as of now, and the absence of the tangible asset requirement behind algorithmic stablecoin eliminates the possibility of errors from the user's end.</p>
<p>Algorithmic stablecoins fills a need in the crypto ecosystem by bridging the seigniorage back into the coin ecosystem where users can share it.</p>
<div>The biggest algorithmic stablecoin in history was Terra USD (UST), which is backed by Terra (LUNA). LUNA acts as collateral for UST, so 1 UST can be minted by burning the equivalent amount of LUNA, and burning 1 UST mints one dollar worth of LUNA. </div>
<p>On May 9, 2022, a bank run on UST led to a depegging, causing the price of UST to fall. As Terra attempted to restore the peg, more LUNA was minted, expanding the supply of LUNA and crashing its price by over 90% in the process. At the time of writing, the UST dollar peg has not been restored.</p>
<div>Other algorithmic stablecoins include USDD on the Tron blockchain, USDN on Near Protocol, and FRAX. FRAX is partially collateralized, while USDD and USDN follow a similar design to the failed UST stablecoin. It is unclear how the depegging of UST will impact the future of other algorithmic stablecoins, at the time of this writing.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is an &quot;All-Time High&quot;?</h2>
<p>&quot;All-Time High&quot; (ATH) refers to the highest price (or market cap) that an asset has reached since its listing or inception. As the price used to define the &quot;all-time high&quot; is the last done, it just refers to the highest price a trader paid for an asset, regardless of how much he bought of the asset.</p>
<p>The all-time high is often quoted in financial assets globally, as it shows the theoretical potential&quot; of the asset. That said, there is no guarantee that the asset will trade back at its all-time highs again, and this metric is more often quoted as a vanity metric.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Allocation is the allotment of equity or tokens that may be earned, bought, or reserved for a specific team, group, investor, institution, or another similar entity.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Allocation?</h2>
<div>Allocation is a term frequently used with maintaining cryptocurrency portfolios. For example, allotting a set percentage of your portfolio to Bitcoin and a mixture of altcoins would be considered as crypto asset allocation. </div>
<div>In the world of blockchain, to ensure the long-term profitability of a business model, crypto projects must decide the allocation of the token and their budget that usually includes marketing, software development, and operating expenditures. Many blockchain projects also have their very own treasuries and foundations, each of which has its own allocated token. It is also typical for blockchain firms to allocate a particular share of tokens to early team members, with the caveat that they can't sell them for a specific period. If a team has an organization or a foundation that is responsible for money/funds, it may choose to put money aside for a token treasury, which can be used as the team or community sees fit.</div>
<p>There is an option for investors to receive allocations in multiple rounds of investments. Early investors may benefit from private sale rounds as projects usually allocate a large size of tokens to this sale as a courtesy of their initial investments. Each of these investors in this instance would possess an allocation of the total amount offered in that specific round of sale. </p>
<div>As a reward for their efforts, team members who are working on a certain currency, protocol, or project may receive a specific portion or amount of tokens that will be allocated to the team before the launch of the sale. These allocations could, for instance, be phased out over time as per a set schedule or handed out all at once on a specific day, such as the token generation event (TGE). </div>

<preview>Alpha version is typically a preliminary version of the software, released to test its usability and interface.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Alpha Version?</h2>
<p>The term 'alpha' came from the first letter of the Greek alphabet, used by scientists to denote which experiments must be tested by further research.</p>
<p>Alpha is a version of something that is not complete or ready for release. Alpha versions are typically preliminary versions of software, released to test its usability and interface. </p>
<p>Alpha testing is often done with a small group outside the organization that developed the product (often under strict confidentiality agreements) and sometimes distributed as a form of beta testing to outside volunteers or through market research firms.</p>
<p>Alpha testing typically starts when the development team thinks they have something ready to test. It continues throughout the development cycle until all identified bugs have been dealt with. When people refer to something as an &quot;alpha product,&quot; they're usually mean that the product has been tested at least once, but may still contain bugs and doesn’t have documents to support the QA.</p>
<p>It doesn't involve much market research, but some basic A/B testing. The tester group might be shown different landing page versions or receive slightly different value propositions than other testers to gauge which version performs better. In addition, because this is an early release, testers will typically have fewer expectations about how the product should work or how they're supposed to use it. They're often more willing to provide feedback on parts of the product that seem buggy, confusing, or hard to use than the users who have been using the same interface for months.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Alpha and Beta Version Testers</h2>
<p>Alpha is the first testing phase. The public isn't supposed to see or know about it. Alpha-version testers are usually internal staff members or close company partners, such as investors and advisors.</p>
<div>Beta version testers are external people who don't work closely with the company. Beta versions are released outside of the company to many users at once to get a broad range of feedback on how well the program works and what features need to be improved.</div>
<h2>What Is Included in an Alpha Version?</h2>
<p>Alpha versions are the first versions of a product. This is where you will find the most bugs and problems, but in rare cases, some alpha versions can be very stable.</p>
<p>An alpha version usually includes all of the basic features a program will contain when it comes out of beta testing. Still, it rarely includes all of the features available in the final released product. Some alpha versions include only a few features in comparison to what will eventually be in the final release.</p>
<p>The time frame for alpha releases varies significantly for each product, but it is typically several months before the beta version is released.</p>
<p>It is said that if your alpha version is too bug-free, it means you didn't get enough feedback from your testers and you should ask for more testing.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Does Alphanumeric Mean?</h2>
<p>Alphanumeric means that something is consisting of both letters and numerals, or a character that has either a letter or a number. </p>
<div>In the world of cryptocurrencies, this is typically connected to setting your password for your cryptocurrency wallet or exchange, where you need to ensure that you are using both letters as well as numbers in order to achieve the greatest level of protection on your account. Essentially what this means is that the more you mix, match and combine these, the lesser the chances are that your account will end up becoming compromised.</div>
<p>What the use of alphanumeric phrases means in crypto is that the more you mix, match and combine characters, letters and numbers, the lesser the chances are that your account will end up becoming compromised.</p>
<p>A primer example of this would be something that includes any single one of the letters from the alphabet, as well as any number from 0 to 9. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z are all alphanumeric characters, as well as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.</p>
<p>These are typically used in passwords in order for them to be hard to discover or hack. Examples of passwords such as these include nfgh1zya6buh1656, 22s7sq4wysltjiaq, g93vvtmlslz4htfs, 6dxa7a3ibiajifzc and many others. </p>
<p>You will find that almost every single cryptocurrency exchange out there will require you to create a strong password in order to use the exchange itself; this is mainly due to the fact that they want to protect you as much as possible.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Altcoin Trader?</h2>
<div>Altcoins refer to any cryptocurrencies that are not Bitcoin, and are seen as “alternatives” to Bitcoin, hence the name. Altcoins are blockchain-based but use different consensus mechanisms to validate transactions. Typically, altcoin developers may advertise their token to be superior to Bitcoin in some way (such as a faster transaction speed, cheaper transaction fees and so forth). Various altcoins compete with Bitcoin for market capitalization hoping to overtake Bitcoin’s top position someday.  </div>
<div>A few of the more well known altcoins include Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano and Dogecoin. Altcoin traders generally trade large volumes of altcoins by the day seeking short term profits. Unlike HODLers, who intend to buy altcoins and keep them for years to come, altcoin traders aim to strategize based on real time news and anticipate optimal timing to realize greatest potential gains, but can incur big losses instead. Altcoin traders attempt to capitalize on the volatility and price fluctuations that a cryptocurrency (specifically altcoin) may undergo in a short period of time.</div>

<preview>Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a scalable, high-speed, and inexpensive web-based cloud storage service to store and retrieve data anytime and anywhere.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Amazon S3?</h2>
<div>Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a cloud storage platform offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) service. It was released back in 2006 to provide clients with access to cloud storage using a customized web interface. Amazon S3 has the same storage architecture as its worldwide e-commerce business, and it can be used to store almost any sort of item, including web applications, data archives, data recovery, recovery plans, analytics, hybrid cloud storage, and much more.</div>
<div>The use of blockchain technology allows developers to create apps that enable numerous parties to conduct transactions without the requirement for a trusted central authority. To create a blockchain platform, reliable infrastructure is required. This is where Amazon Managed Blockchain comes into the picture along with its Amazon S3 that plays a crucial role in securing and storing sensitive blockchain data. </div>
<div>With encryption capabilities and access management tools, users may store their data in Amazon S3 and protect it from unwanted access. S3 Block Public Access is a simple storage solution that allows users to restrict public access to all of their objects at the bucket or account level. S3 is also in compliance with the legal procedures and regulatory obligations, such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, EU Data Protection Directive, and FISMA. The platform also offers a variety of auditing options for tracking access requests to a user’s S3 resources.</div>
<p>Amazon S3 users only have access to the S3 resources that they create by default, which helps them with safeguarding their data in the S3 buckets. Using one or a combination of the following access control tools, users can provide access to their data to others. Some of these tools include: </p>
<div>For data uploads, Amazon S3 offers both server-side encryption and client-side encryption. Unauthorized users can't access anyone’s data since Amazon S3 has configurable security settings. Users can connect S3 resources from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud using VPC endpoints. They can also check the encryption state of their S3 objects using the S3 Inventory.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is AMLD5?</h2>
<div>The European Union’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMDL5) is an update to the union’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework. It came into effect on July 9, 2018, and required that the EU’s 28 member countries enact the update into national law by 10 January 2020. </div>
<p>An EU directive is a legal framework that encompasses a common goal each member state is required to achieve by including it in its own laws. Directives are not legally binding but failure to adhere to them may impose fines. Although the deadline has passed, some member states have still not been able to meet AMLD5’s requirements due to the complex regulatory challenges it presents. </p>
<div>AMLD5 has introduced new requirements for cryptocurrencies, Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) registers, and prepaid card transaction limits. This update is expected to improve the EU’s anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) policies by closing loopholes that are still being exploited by financial criminals and bringing its efforts in line with new FATF Standards, which were updated in June 2019 to include virtual asset and virtual asset service provider guidance. </div>
<div>AMLD5 includes an update on obligated entities, which includes fiat-to-crypto companies and custodian wallet service providers, customer due diligence for funds from high-risk third countries, UBO registration, and Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) screening.</div>

<file>anarcho-capitalism.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A political philosophy originally conceived by American economist Murray Rothbard that has now been embraced by many members of the crypto community.</preview>
<description>
<p>Anarcho-capitalism advocates for the abolition of centralized states, and the primacy of private property and contractual agreements in the economic system. </p>
<p>Anarcho-capitalists believe that the state as it is currently conceived is an impediment to the development of a “free” society — and that the existence of states in capitalist societies result in a system of coercion. </p>
<p>This political philosophy maintains that the free market is the cornerstone of a truly free society, and that people should be free to engage with each other through contractual agreements — beyond the control or oversight of the state. </p>
<p>Instead of the state handling the enforcement of contracts and the resolution of grievances, private agencies competing in a free market would take charge.</p>
<p>Anarcho-capitalists believe that the means of production should be privately owned — and that work and commodities should be organized through the system of wage labor. </p>
<div>The concept of &quot;original appropriation&quot; allows for any individual to claim an absolute right of ownership over any resource that has not previously been used. “Self-ownership” is another important principle, and this refers to an individual's absolute right over their own body.Many anarcho-capitalists consider blockchain-based decentralized technologies to be a means by which the practical problems of anarcho-capitalism may be solved. </div>
<div>They claim that decentralized services provide an alternative to the bureaucratic functions of the state, particularly by providing immutable and publicly available records of identity and contractual obligations (the latter through the use of smart contracts.)There have been small-scale experiments in the creation of real communities organized according to anarcho-capitalist principles. The most notable of these is Liberstad, a private city-society in Norway that was founded in 2015.</div>

<div>An angel investor puts up capital to assist a company that is in its early stages of development. Unlike venture capitalists, who are typically bound to a professional venture capital firm and invest a pooled sum, angel investors are lone individuals taking their own risks and financing a vision they support. In return for backing a new start up, angel investors are often rewarded with equity in the company. If the venture is successful, angel investors get to make back their investment and then some. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is An Annual Percentage Rate (APR)?</h2>
<div>The monetary value or reward that investors may earn by making their crypto tokens accessible for loans, taking into consideration the interest rates and any other fees that borrowers must pay, is referred to as the annual percentage rate (APR). Customers are encouraged by multiple platforms to stake their crypto assets by offering them a high annual percentage rate (APR). APR is exclusive of compounding interest. </div>
<div>Some cryptocurrency exchanges do not allow you to lend out your coin. However, those exchanges that do, offer different rates. These interest rates fluctuate significantly based on the sort of loan or currency you lend out.</div>
<p>Fixed and flexible loans are the two major types of loans offered by exchanges.</p>
<div>Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, provides a variety of investment options through Binance Earn, including both fixed and flexible financing. </div>
<div>Investors must keep in mind that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. As a result, the amount of interest you earn may be variable. Crypto lending programs are appealing for those investors who want to keep their coins for a long term, hence passive income will add value to their portfolio. However, any changes in the price of the cryptocurrency would have an impact on their revenue. Investors who take part in fixed loan programs can expect fluctuations in the value of their portfolio since they will not be able to exchange coins that are locked up for a specific length of time.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Annual Percentage Yield (APY)?</h2>
<div>Annual percentage yield (APY) acts as a cryptocurrency savings account similar to an annual percentage rate (APR) account. You may deposit your bitcoin (or another crypto asset) and receive a fixed rate of return over a specific period of time.</div>
<div>The annual percentage yield (APY) is a method of calculating the amount of money earned on a money market account over the course of a year. To put it another way, this is a technique to track how interest accumulates over time.</div>
<div>The interest you earn on your funds is referred to as compounding interest. It refers to the amount received on both the principal amount (the money you put into the account) and the interest that has been accumulated. Compounding makes it possible to create money over time, which is why it is such a strong instrument for investment. This is not the same as simple interest. The term &quot;simple interest&quot; refers to interest generated just on the main deposit.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrency savings accounts with APY may be just what you need if you are a crypto investor who wants to make a return on investment while holding it. There are a number of crypto yield programs to choose from. Therefore, do your research before signing up for one. Factors like fees, entrance barriers, interest-earning procedure, and types of crypto assets available may vary from platform to platform. s</div>
<div>There are also introductory APYs that crypto exchanges offer and you should be careful before investing in them. Some of these programs utilize the strategy of offering higher APYs to attract customers in the beginning and drop the rates after trapping a big pool of customers. If you come across a yield farming platform or program offering high APYs, make sure to check its credibility in the community.</div>

<h2>What Does It Mean to Be Anonymous?</h2>
<p>Anonymous is when something is of unknown authorship or origin: someone who is not named, identified, or known. Their anonymity can be due to the fact that they want to remain anonymous. They lack individuality, distinction, or recognizability. </p>
<div>Anonymity has been one of the primary appeals of cryptocurrencies throughout their history. One such anonymity oriented technology is found in Zcash, which has implemented a cryptographic tool known as zero-knowledge proof and can grant any participant an option to shield their transactions, which allows them to transact without the need to reveal their addresses. It also obfuscates the transaction amount — this is a good example of anonymity in cryptocurrency.</div>

<preview>The anti-dumping policy is a set of rules that protects investors from falling victim to a pump and dump scheme.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Anti-Dumping Policy?</h2>
<div>An anti-dumping policy is a set of rules that prevents investors from falling victim to pump and dump schemes. Dumping is a term that refers to an occurrence when a big investor, also known as a whale, buys a huge number of tokens with the intention of substantially increasing the price before selling all of it for a large profit.</div>
<div>Take for example the SQUID token, which was once valued at only $0.01. However, as the price began to skyrocket, investors were barred from selling SQUID due to a number of policies in line, one of which was the &quot;anti-dumping policy.&quot; In a market structured with just buyers when the price of SQUID skyrocketed the fraudsters ran off with all the invested amount. The token's price plummeted from $2,856 to $0.00079 within a few minutes.</div>
<div>However, not all tokens work like this. Coins such as THUNDERCAKE and DrunkDoge offer anti-dumping protection to investors. </div>
<div>More than 0.1 percent of the total supply of THUNDERCAKE tokens cannot be sold. Furthermore, the buy orders of the THUNDERCAKE tokens cannot exceed 0.5 percent of the entire supply. Both of these rules are in place to keep whales out of their ecosystem and avoid dumping.</div>
<div>Likewise, DrunkDoge regulates price volatility by prohibiting whales from purchasing or selling significant sums of tokens in a single transaction. It has an anti-dumping mechanism in place which enforces a 1/2/6 hour cooling-off period and increased tax after each sale to avoid excessive currency dumping.</div>
<div>To protect investors, there are more policies in place apart from anti-dumping, such as buybacks. Companies use a buyback policy for many reasons—to lower the number of tokens in circulation with time. The aim is to significantly raise token values, generate speculation, and build hype.</div>
<div>Several projects have conducted buybacks including Binance, Nexo, and others. Nexo's buyback, for example, occurred because the core development team estimated their asset's depreciation. As a result, they decided to restrict the number of project tokens in circulation which helped in improving the market price.</div>
<p>With the frenzy that surrounds a token price surge, you may be tempted to make an investment or try your luck like everyone else, but there are some ground rules that you must observe.</p>

<title>Anti-Fragile</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/anti-fragile</url>
<file>anti-fragile.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A quality attached to an asset that means it performs better when exposed to volatility and shocks.</preview>
<description>
<div>If an asset is anti-fragile, this can mean that it tends to perform better whenever there is risk and uncertainty.</div>
<p>Some experts, such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb, have argued that Bitcoin falls into this category.</p>
<p>Explaining what he meant, the bestselling author said: “Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility.”</p>
<div>This fits into the narrative that some cryptoassets, BTC included, tend to experience price gains whenever uncertainty rocks the stock market – cementing the narrative that it is a safe haven asset such as gold.</div>
<div>Another characteristic of antifragility involves the asset in question getting stronger whenever there is a major setback. In this regard, analysts point to how BTC thrived despite the dramatic crash of 2018, when prices fell by 80% in the space of a year. Bitcoin has also weathered controversies including its code being exploited, as well as hard forks that threaten to split the blockchain network in two.</div>
<p>The idea that Bitcoin only exists because a certain amount of people believe in it makes it immediately vulnerable and weak. It allows those external to the issue to believe that just as it was once created, it could just vanish like a fashion trend.</p>
<p>The thesis of anti-fragility suggests that Bitcoin has become stronger and stronger with every hit it has suffered. This is evidenced by how greater numbers of people have continued to embrace the cryptocurrency.</p>
<div>Another important element of anti-fragility is linked to how Bitcoin cannot be abruptly shut down by a single party. The blockchain’s decentralized nature means that it runs on countless thousands of computers at the same time – and as a result, it is impossible for an individual to knock it offline.</div>
<p>All of this could also make Bitcoin much harder to regulate going forward.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Anti-Malware is a type of application software that prevents, detects, and removes malware from computers &amp; electronic devices.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Anti-Malware?</h2>
<div>Cryptocurrencies have no geographical boundaries—anyone can access them anywhere, at any time, with no restrictions or hidden fees from mediators. The world of blockchain is popular for its anonymity as the private information of users is protected behind a cryptographic wall. It keeps them safe from fraud and identity theft.</div>
<div>However, the apparent profitability, ease, and anonymity of cryptocurrencies also make them a perfect breeding ground for hackers. The rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies has coincided with an increase in the number of malware infections that infect computers and transform them into armies of cryptocurrency-mining machines.</div>
<div>Malware is a term that refers to any form of malicious software that is meant to harm computers and computer systems. Viruses, trojan horses, and ransomware are just a few examples of malware. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including profit, extortion, surveillance, restricting activities, remote control, deletion, and the dissemination of false or unlawful information. In addition to being harmful, malware has the ability to get access to a system without authorization and, in most cases, without the user's knowledge.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrency-mining malware is intended to infect botnets of computers. It follows the same pattern as a variety of other threats, including malware-laden spam emails, downloads from dangerous URLs, junkware, and unwanted software. Cryptocurrency-mining malware drains the resources of infected computers, reducing their productivity and causing breakage inside their operating systems. It also causes additional expenses to crypto miners, such as higher electricity usage.</div>
<p>These viruses can jeopardize a network or system's reliability, security, and confidentiality, possibly disrupting an organization's mission-critical activities. Theft of information and system takeover are also serious consequences. These threats can also serve as a conduit for the delivery of further malware. </p>
<div>Cryptocurrency-mining malware can cause systems to decelerate and risk end-users and businesses to data/identity theft, hijacking, and other risks. It can even make the victims part of the problem by turning their PCs into zombies - eating away the brains (software) of other computers and infecting them with malware as well.</div>
<div>Anti-Malware applications are comprehensive solutions that keep computers secure and protect critical data sent over a network or kept locally. Anti-Malware software includes several components, such as anti-spyware and anti-phishing software, as well as antivirus solutions for well-known infections that are separated and recognized by security resources.</div>
<div>Industry-standard anti-malware &amp; antivirus tools, like Kaspersky and Bit Defender, can identify risks across the board and guard against cryptojacking malware. It is better to take preventative measures and install antivirus software before becoming a victim. Installing the most recent software updates and patches for your operating system and apps, particularly for web browsers, is also a smart idea.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is &quot;Anti-Money Laundering&quot;?</h2>
<p>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to a set of laws and regulations enacted to prevent the illegal movement of money worldwide. Money laundering refers to the process of concealing the origins of (illegally obtained) cash by passing it through a usually complex sequence of transfers or transactions. These transactions are generally legitimate and hence would not be flagged, thus allowing the original owner of the illegitimate funds to use the funds for lawful purposes.</p>
<p>AML targets criminal activities like trading in illegal goods (drugs, contraband, etc.), public office corruption and tax evasion, to name a few. It deals explicitly with methods concealing these crimes and the money obtained from these acts.</p>
<p>Financial institutions play a significant role in AML. If criminals cannot successfully move the proceeds of these illegal acts, they would not be incentivized to perform these crimes. Therefore, financial institutions are required to monitor customers’ transactions and deposit records, especially when they appear to be larger than ordinary.</p>

<h2>What Is Antivirus Software?</h2>
<p>Computer viruses have existed almost as long as computers have. At first these pieces of code were created for self-replication and did no harm. Very soon, their purpose has changed. Usually a virus is an executable file or a piece of code that is designed to do malicious things on a computer system. Initially, they were spread mainly through floppy disks, but viruses have really flourished in the era of networked computers. </p>
<p>The first antiviruses appeared almost the same time as the first viruses. The term has evolved over time, along with the programs themselves. Today, we expect anti-virus software to protect our computer systems from viruses, adware and spyware, ransomware and keyloggers, backdoors and rootkits, trojas, worms, dialers, fraud tools, etc., but very often it has the additional functionality of a network firewall, such as protecting us from DDoS attacks, spam, scam and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>There are three basic mechanics behind antivirus software workings:</p>
<p>However, new tools are emerging every day, the most recent include data mining, sandboxing and many more.</p>
<p>In order for the antivirus software to work its best and keep up with the latest viruses, it has to be regularly updated. Among the established antivirus product vendors one can often find ESET NOD, Norton, Kaspersky, Avast!, McAfee and many more.</p>
<p>A common critique against antivirus software often touches a few key points: </p>

<h2>What Is Apeing?</h2>
<p>Apeing is when a cryptocurrency trader buys a token shortly after the token project launch without conducting thorough research, usually because they are fearful of missing out on potential gains that could be lost if they hesitate in order to conduct due diligence. </p>
<p>The term apeing became popular during the 2020 &quot;DeFi Summer&quot; when sudden and unannounced token project launches led to a small proportion of traders making significant profits from buying those project tokens within a very short time frame after the initial launch. </p>
<p>As stories of these substantial gains leaked onto social media, subsequent traders tried to emulate them by buying the tokens of any freshly launched project without conducting thorough research. This ‘low IQ’ approach to selecting tokens to buy is what gives apeing its name.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Application Layer?</h2>
<p>An application layer is the topmost layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for displaying received information to the user or providing means to input data from the user to be sent down to lower layers.</p>
<p>It defines a communication partner, e.g., a process or software program, and the way it communicates with other applications.</p>
<p>The application layer is responsible for providing interfaces and services to the user. It also supports services like message handling systems, shared database management systems, transaction processing systems, etc.</p>
<h2>Examples of Application Layer Protocols</h2>
<div>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – DHCP is a protocol used by network devices (servers, routers, modems, etc.) to provide IP addresses automatically for devices connected on a network using Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). </div>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) – DNS stands for Domain Name System. When you enter a URL into the address bar of your browser, the DNS records associated with that domain convert the domain name to an IP address, which enables your browser to connect to the website you want to visit.</p>
<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) – A protocol used to transfer text, audio, video, and other multimedia files between the server and client. It is used on the internet for sharing information through World Wide Web pages. HTTP is a TCP/IP-based application layer protocol that runs on top of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for the transmission of data packets.</p>
<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – SMTP is an application layer TCP/IP protocol that is used to send e-mails from one machine to another over networks. It enables any machine connected to the internet to send e-mail messages to any other machine with an e-mail address.</p>
<p>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – FTP is a protocol that enables file transfers between client and server applications over a TCP/IP-based network, such as the internet. FTP is one of the oldest internet services and has been in use for decades</p>
<p>Application is closest to the end-user, enabling direct interaction between user and software. </p>
<h2>Functions of Application Layer </h2>
<p>User support and information services: The application layer consists of a variety of user support and information services, such as remote login, file transfer, electronic mail, multimedia conferencing, and database access.</p>
<p>Resource sharing: The application layer also provides an interface between the network and the application program for resource sharing. This allows users to share resources such as files, printers, and databases over the network.</p>
<p>Standardization: Another important function of the application layer is to provide standardization among different types of networks. For example, when a user sends an electronic mail from one network to another network using two different protocols, the application layer on both sides converts the data into a common format so that it can be understood by both parties.</p>
<p>Application layer protocols also require services from lower layers that address issues such as data integrity (whether data has been altered in transit), reliability (whether data was actually received), duplicate delivery (whether multiple copies were created), sequencing (whether segments arrive in order), and timing (whether segments arrive too early or too late).</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is AR Token?</h2>
<div>Arweave is a decentralized permanent storage platform where AR is its native token.</div>
<div>The maximum supply of the AR token is 66 million, out of which 55 million tokens were minted when the genesis block was created at the mainnet launch. The remaining 11 million AR tokens are set to be rewarded to miners.  </div>
<p>Once all of the 66 million AR tokens are minted, this cryptocurrency will become deflationary. One of the impressive aspects of AR token is 600% growth in its value after the first half of 2021.</p>
<div>Being the native token of Arweave, it has wide utility across the Arweave ecosystem. Some of the use cases of AR include the following:</div>
<p>To be used as the cryptocurrency for all sorts of transactions fees pertaining to storage and retrieval of data.</p>
<div>To be used for interacting with multiple decentralized apps (dApps) built on Arweave. </div>
<p>To acquire data storage on Arweave, users need to pay distributed storage fees in AR. </p>
<p>Arweave pays incentives to storage providers in AR only. </p>
<h2>What Is Arweave?</h2>
<p>Arweave is a new type of decentralized storage that allows users to store data permanently by leveraging novel technologies, such as blockweave, permaweb, and proof of access.</p>
<p>Blockweave and Proof of Access (PoA) sit at the core of the Arweave network.</p>
<p>Unlike blockchain which is typically used to build crypto projects, blockweave stores both transactional and data information. Another difference is in terms of how blocks on blockweave are connected to their previous blocks. In blockchain, each block refers to the previous one. On the other hand, a previous block in a blockweave is connected to the recall block (a randomly selected block).  </p>
<p>Another component of Arweave is permaweb, which is a layer built on top of Arweave blockchain. Permaweb is where all the decentralized apps are stored, meaning it’s completely decentralized as well.</p>
<div>Arweave uses Proof of Access, an alternative to the standard blockchain consensus mechanism. Miners on Arweave don’t need to store all blocks that helps prevent extensive electricity consumption. </div>
<p>Arweave may seem to operate on a complex mechanism, but all of the complicated technicalities are on its back-end. Its front-end is what makes it an easy-to-use platform, which is intuitively designed keeping in mind the user. All it takes is an Arweave browser extension to store website pages on the network. </p>
<div>One key feature is its immutability when it comes to the data stored on the network. Immutability is found in every aspect as the applications are permanent. Even the creators can’t alter the rules – making Arweave an immutable decentralized web. </div>
<p>The future may seem bright for Arweave, but it’ll face some challenges pertaining to scalability.</p>

<title>Arbitrage</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/arbitrage</url>
<file>arbitrage.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Arbitrage is the practice of quickly buying and selling the same asset in different markets to take advantage of price differences between the markets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Arbitrage?</h2>
<div>Markets, such as stock and cryptocurrency exchanges, are by nature inefficient due to a multitude of factors: differing degrees of access to information among market participants, different trading tools and techniques, transaction costs, human psychology and more. These inefficiencies often result in a difference between the prices of the same asset — for example, a cryptocurrency — in different markets.</div>
<div>Arbitrage traders take advantage of these price differences by near-simultaneously buying of an asset in the market where it is cheaper, and then selling it in the market where it is priced higher.</div>
<div>The main reason for the existence of arbitrage is usually market inefficiencies. Arbitrageurs profit from this by making markets more efficient, ensuring that the same asset is similarly priced across different exchanges. By buying on the cheaper exchange and selling on the more expensive one, arbitrageurs narrow the &quot;spread&quot; that exists between these exchanges, thus reducing the opportunity for arbitrage and therefore making markets more efficient. Arbitrage is a crucial force as it ensures that no assets deviate from their fair value for prolonged periods of time and enhances the flow of liquidity between exchanges.</div>
<p>Given the nature of the way that arbitrage is executed (buying and selling the same quantity on different exchanges), the arbitrageur takes little to no price risk on the strategy. However, there is risk involved in arbitrage, which comes from needing to execute the strategy near-instantaneously and the cost of trading (commissions). Arbitrageurs usually end up paying a lot in commissions as every unit of trade requires the trader to pay the different exchanges he/she is trading on.</p>
<div>Arbitrage trades can be performed between two or more markets with one or more assets. For example, it can be as simple as buying Bitcoin (BTC) at $14,975 per coin on exchange A and selling it for $14,987 on exchange B. More complicated trades can also take place, like triangular arbitrage, which involves the buying and selling of three different assets in three different markets.</div>
<p>The development of technologies, such as automated trading, tends to eliminate opportunities for arbitrage trading much more quickly, making the practice more difficult for the traders. However, for as long as markets remain not perfectly efficient, arbitrage will continue to perform its vital function.</p>

<title>Aroon Indicator</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/aroon-indicator</url>
<file>aroon-indicator.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Aroon Indicator is used to identify the existence, changes, and corrective retracements and gauge the strength of an ongoing trend in financial markets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Aroon Indicator?</h2>
<div>In 1995, Tushar Chande came up with the concept of Aroon Indicator (a part of many technical pattern-based signals) that determines if the value of asset/stock/cryptocurrency is rising and how strong the trend is, somewhat similar to the Average Directional Index (ADX).</div>
<div>In the Sanskrit language, the word &quot;Aroon&quot; signifies &quot;the earliest light of the dawn.&quot; Because the indications are meant to identify the start of a new trend, Chande picked this moniker for this technical indicator. Aroon Indicators can be used by traders to detect developing trends, identify consolidations, define corrective periods, and predict reversals in the asset's price.</div>
<div>The two Aroon indicators essentially track when the most recent highs and lows happened, correspondingly. Lower Aroon values indicate a more distantly occurring high or low, whereas higher Aroon values indicate a more recently happening high or low. A stronger trend is indicated by higher Aroon values, whereas a weaker trend or no trend is indicated by lower Aroon values.</div>
<p>The Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down indicators monitor the number of time periods since a price struck an x-day high or low. For example, the number of days since a 25-day high is noted by a 25-day Aroon-Up while the number of days since a 25-day low is counted by the 25-day Aroon-Down indicator. This way, the Aroon indicators are different from traditional momentum oscillators in that they are concerned with price in relation to time.</p>
<div>These indicators can help market researchers and traders in multiple ways. Aroon crossovers can be used to provide trading signals. Overlaps of the two Aroon indicators are typically considered trend shift or market reversal signals. An example of such crossovers or overlaps includes the Aroon-Up indicator generating a bullish crossover just above the Aroon-Down indicator or the Aroon-Down indicator generating a bearish crossover just above the Aroon-Up indicator.</div>
<div>The value of indicators range between zero and one hundred. A reading of more than 50 indicates that a high/low (whichever line is higher than 50) occurred within the previous 12 periods. A value of less than 50 indicates that the high/low occurred during the 13-period time frame. The weaker the uptrend and the greater the decline, the lower the Aroon Up, and vice versa.</div>
<h2>How to Calculate Aroon Indicator Values?</h2>
<p>Here’s how you can calculate the Aroon Indicator:</p>
<p>AroonUp = 100 * ((X – Number of periods since highest high)/X);</p>
<p>AroonDown = 100 * ((X – Number of periods since lowest low)/X);</p>
<div>Aroon Indicator may indicate excellent entry or exit points at times, but it may also offer faulty or misleading indications. The buy or sell signal may arrive too late after a significant price movement already takes place. This occurs because the indication isn't predictive and uses historical data. As a result, rather than responding solely to the Aroon signal, traders should look into other technical indicators, corroborating price and volume activity to trade more effectively. These include, but are not limited to on-balance volume (OBV), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), RSI, accumulation/distribution indicator, and stochastic oscillator.</div>

<file>ashdraked.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The complete loss of a trader's total invested capital, specifically as a result of shorting Bitcoin.</preview>
<description>
<p>The term “ashdraking” was coined following the activities of Lord Ashdrake — a pseudonymous Romanian Bitcoin trader who was prominent in the mid-2010s. </p>
<div>Ashdrake was a high-profile crypto skeptic. He determinedly had a strategy of shorting BTC — that is, betting that the digital asset would decline in value. </div>
<p>He enjoyed significant success between 2014 and 2015, a period of precipitous losses in which Bitcoin lost nearly half its value, and he became a prominent voice encouraging traders to adopt short positions.When Bitcoin broke $300, Lord Ashdrake again shorted the currency — but this time the market was not in his favor. </p>
<div>Prices rose rapidly, breaking $500 and nearly touching $600 — just a few weeks after the $300 milestone. Ashdrake continued to exclusively hold an aggressively short position, which ultimately caused him to lose his entire invested capital.Ashdraking remains a concern for traders. In 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) became the first major exchange to offer traders an opportunity to trade Bitcoin futures — that is, to place bets on the price of Bitcoin without having to actually hold any crypto themselves. </div>
<p>The CBOE launch was considered a key test for Bitcoin, and the generally crypto-skeptic mainstream financial press strongly predicted that institutional investors would take large short positions en masse. </p>
<p>This did not happen, with the futures posting huge rises within just a few hours. This caused some prominent brokers to completely forbid their clients from taking short positions because of a fear that they too would be “Ashdraked.”Lord Ashdrake (or someone claiming to be him) remains a prominent voice in the crypto community. In October 2020, he gave an interview to blogger zoomerjd, in which he talked extensively about the notorious incident.</p>

<title>ASIC</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/asic</url>
<file>asic.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An acronym for application-specific integrated circuit — a device designed for the sole purpose of mining cryptocurrencies.</preview>
<description>
<p>Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) can be thought of as “crypto mining machines.” </p>
<div>In the early days of crypto, most mining was conducted on CPUs and GPUs — indeed, Bitcoin was designed specifically to be mined on conventional computers. </div>
<p>But by the mid-2010s, it had become impossible to conduct profitable mining operations using everyday devices because of limits on computing power and the costs associated with energy consumption. </p>
<div>ASICs tackle both these problems. They are designed solely for mining (and some ASICs are purpose built for mining specific cryptocurrencies) — and they can also be engineered to maximize computing power while keeping energy demands to a minimum. </div>
<p>Today, all large-scale crypto mining is conducted using ASICs, often in closely controlled data centers. They’re normally based in countries where power is relatively cheap.</p>
<p>There are several key factors that determine the potential profitability of a specific ASIC. They include:</p>
<div>1. The number of hashes the hardware can generate per second</div>
<p>2. The total hash rate across the network</p>
<p>3. The value of the coin being mined</p>
<p>4. Energy consumption per hash generated</p>
<p>5. The initial cost of the hardware itself</p>
<p>Dedicated directories such as ASIC Miner Value provide real-time league tables of the most efficient ASICs currently available. They also show the break-even point for each model of ASIC — that is, the time it will take for the ASIC to generate enough income to cover the cost of the hardware.Popular ASIC manufacturers include Bitmain, Innosilicon, ASICminer, and MicroBT. The most efficient ASICs currently on the market can cost several thousand dollars.</p>

<title>ASIC-Resistant</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/asic-resistant</url>
<file>asic-resistant.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>This term usually applies to blockchains and mining algorithms, designed to give no benefit for ASICs over consumer grade hardware.</preview>
<description>
<div>ASIC means an application-specific integrated circuit. Most consumer computer hardware is a general function hardware, able to perform almost any operations that software orders it to do. This versatility, however, comes at a cost: generalization is the opposite of optimization. When someone needs to create a device that will do only one thing, like a digital clock for example, it is way more efficient to create a specific PCB than use a whole laptop. The same for cryptocurrencies. </div>
<div>Proof-of-work consensus algorithms are the basis of many popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. In order to confirm each new block, computers on a blockchain have to solve a complex puzzle, making multiple attempts to find a solution to a mathematical problem. GPUs usually excel in parallel computation and do it faster, with more energy efficiency than the CPU.  Later on, if it becomes economically viable, chip manufacturers produce an ASIC miner for a specific mining algorithm. As the main purpose of an ASIC is to perform as many attempts (hashing functions) per second as possible, they make for a way better tool to mine Bitcoin or other ASIC-mineable PoW cryptocurrencies, as opposed to a GPU. They just do the job better, because they are designed for this one specific job.</div>
<p>Bitcoin ASIC miners these days have a million times better performance than a desktop PC, rendering the latter completely useless in modern day mining. Moreover, since most of the hashpower eventually got located in a few gargantuan mining pools, situated in regions with access to cheap electricity and favorable legal conditions, PC mining isa thing of the past for most cryptocurrencies.</p>
<div>This situation effectively undermines and threatens the cornerstone of crypto philosophy: decentralization. A power outage in Northern China in early 2021 resulted in the Bitcoin network hashrate dropping in half for several days, proving that we are dangerously close to losing the independent nature of the first cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>Here comes the idea of ASIC resistance. In theory, an ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency is more fairly distributed because it can be mined on regular consumer PCs. This should guarantee that more people can participate in the mining — as a result, there’s no ASIC arms race, leaving the regular folk sidelined and the mining process stays less capital-intensive in general. Such a network will more likely be decentralized and geographically distributed. It does not guarantee that gigantic mining farms near hydropower dams will not emerge, but it makes sure that they can not dominate the field entirely.</p>
<p>ASIC-resistant solutions focus on decisive governance and, of course, theright mining algorithm. It should by design prevent the creation ASICs or at least give them no benefit over consumer PC hardware. The specific technical approaches include algorithm variability for each mining block (such as x16r, which quite soon got ASIC’ed), increased memory demand (such as Scrypt and Ethash) or even focusing the mining on the storage volume like Chia. </p>
<div>Ethereum is the largest cryptocurrency with the goal of remaining ASIC-resistant until it moves to the 2.0. version and a proof-of-stake consensus. It has been relatively successful: by mid 2021, it is mined mainly on graphic cards, but new ASIC miners have emerged with a power of 32 graphic cards. ASIC resistance is a game of defense, with no guarantee that any hashing algorithm can avoid the creation of an ASIC miner crafted for it if the underlying cryptocurrency price makes it economically feasible.</div>

<title>Ask Price</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ask-price</url>
<file>ask-price.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The minimum price that a seller is willing to accept for an asset. The ask price is also sometimes referred to as the offer price.</preview>
<description>
<div>The ask price is one of the most fundamental factors in the functioning of any exchange. </div>
<div>It is part of the two-way “bid and ask” system for quoting prices. The bid price is set by the buyer and is the maximum amount they are willing to pay for the asset in question, denominated in the base currency.When making an immediate trade on an exchange (known as a market order,) buy and sell orders are matched with the most beneficial corresponding prices — so a buy order will be matched with the lowest ask price, and a sell order will be matched with the highest bid price.Imagine you wish to trade a fictional coin. You see that the market price of that coin is $100/$120. This implies that you will pay $120 to buy the coin, while a seller will receive $100 by selling one.The difference between the ask price and the bid price is known as the spread. This is where the exchange makes its money and covers its running costs. </div>
<div>Spreads are also closely linked to market liquidity levels — that is, how easy it is to buy or sell an asset. </div>
<p>Highly liquid markets tend to have smaller spreads because there are more participants willing to trade, while low liquidity is often accompanied by larger spreads. </p>
<div>Spreads are also influenced by factors such as changes in transaction costs. </div>
<p>Some exchanges market themselves on the basis of their average spread size in an attempt to attract traders away from competitors.</p>

<title>Asset-Backed Tokens</title>

<file>asset-backed-tokens.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Asset-backed tokens are digital claims on a physical asset and are backed by that asset.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Asset-Backed Tokens?</h2>
<p>Asset-backed tokens are digital claims on a physical asset and are backed by that asset. Gold, crude oil, real estate, equity, soybeans or just about any other real, physical asset can be tokenized and become an asset-backed token. </p>
<p>Asset-backed tokens are an evolution made possible by blockchain technology. Bitcoin, of course, was the very first token, but that cryptocurrency is not backed by any physical asset. Since Bitcoin, a lot has changed and today there are thousands of different cryptocurrencies available, from new digital ones to stablecoins pegged to fiat currency. But the cryptocurrency revolution and its volatility has spurred innovations for more stable tokenized assets that are designed to store value and be exchanged between peers without the need for a financial institution to mediate.  </p>
<p>The next iteration of cryptocurrency innovations brings this interface into the realm of the practical and the physical, with asset-backed tokens that represent real-world assets. An asset-backed token’s value is directly affected by the worth of its underlying asset, and is generally classified as a security by financial regulators. </p>
<p>Ownership of the token usually represents a right of ownership over the asset and, depending on the asset, may come with the expectation of future returns when the asset appreciates in value. As the asset itself appreciates in value, so does the token. </p>
<p>The development of these tokens also means an individual, company, or other entity  can seek investment in exchange for the token, and raise capital through a blockchain-based system, done by issuing asset-backed tokens as new equity instruments, per financial regulations. </p>
<div>Alternatively, businesses could tokenize existing assets for sale. Individual investors, not just wealthy ones, can now buy into real-world business assets without physically storing or exchanging them. This not only reduces trade friction, but also lowers logistics costs. Through asset-backed tokens, transactions can happen faster and more efficiently. </div>
<p>Asset-backed tokens can also solve problems created by inflated or devalued currencies, as well as the unpredictable stock market, giving individuals a reasonable new financial alternative that combines digital liquidity with hard asset values when needed. We are already observing the potential of asset-backed tokens as they gain wider traction across various applications. </p>
<p>Governments are tying crude oil to the value of official digital tokens, and the real-estate market has been slowly moving towards tokenized fractional ownership. Asset-backed tokens are improving liquidity to previously illiquid markets and enabling cost-effective transactions that don’t rey on a central party, and promote both security and transparency. This is having a major impact on the way we all do businesses and think about ownership and wealth creation in the future.</p>

<preview>Assets under management measures the total market values of all the funds controlled by an individual or financial institution on behalf of their clients.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Assets Under Management (AUM)?</h2>
<div>Assets under management (AUM), also known as funds under management, is the total market value of investments or assets that are managed by a hedge fund, mutual fund, or wealth management company on behalf of their clients. AUM changes depending on the performance of the funds and the money investors are putting in or taking out.</div>
<div>Assets under management (AUM) is a well-known practice in the crypto and the DeFi space. Cypto traders, who are just stepping into the crypto space need to find a reliable wallet and exchange that support their desired cryptocurrencies that becomes quite hectic for beginners. It is preferred to go for the wallets and exchanges that support a large number of coins and tokens.</div>
<div>Due to the complications involved in the process, many agencies are coming forward with a new tool called asset management. Rather than dealing with several accounts and wallets, crypto asset management platforms do the job of helping customers by merging their holdings. </div>
<p>AUM is a significant marker that manages all the aspects of funds and crypto. If the AUM is $1 million, then it is considered small fry, but if it’s more than $1 billion, then it’s considered a big project. Since regulated funds need the proper third-party services, such as fund administrators, auditors, and custodians, they tend to require at least $10 million to cover overhead costs. In most countries, managing a fund requires a license by local security exchange commissions.</p>

<file>astroturfing.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The practice of disguising marketing campaigns or otherwise sponsored messaging as the unprompted views of genuine community members.</preview>
<description>
<p>This controversial practice involves trying to achieve credibility and authenticity by making marketing and PR messages appear like they are occurring naturally in a grassroots community.</p>
<p>Astroturfing has a long history as a favored technique of both political groups and private businesses. One notable example includes the tobacco industry's establishment of the fake National Smokers Alliance lobby group.</p>
<div>Another concerns Microsoft’s sponsorship of a pressure group that intended to create an illusion that the company had support during a bitter antitrust lawsuit. More recently, the Kremlin is alleged to have built a vast army of fake online profiles and bots to sow disinformation globally.Astroturfing became much more widely used with the explosion of the internet. Now, almost any organization can establish a large network of fake online identities with ease — and they can be directed to post whatever content the organization dictates. Advanced “persona management” software can equip each of these identities with their own IP address and confected online history.Awareness of astroturfing is now widespread, and the reputational risks associated with the practice are high. Many jurisdictions have legislated to crack down on it — and now, several countries require bloggers, social media users and influencers to clearly mark sponsored content with an #ad tag.Despite this, astroturfing remains rife in the crypto community. The technique has been regularly used to generate interest in ICOs, with Telegram and Discord among the most favored channels. It is thought that there are now dozens of marketing companies dedicated almost entirely to running astroturfing campaigns designed specifically for the crypto industry.Common signs of astroturfing activities include extremely rapid growth in Telegram and Discord community membership. There are also several tools allowing users to “audit” the authenticity of profiles on Twitter and other social networks.</div>

<file>asynchronous.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Events that do not occur simultaneously or at the same rate are referred to as asynchronous.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Asynchronous?</h2>
<div>In computer science, asynchrony refers to the occurrence of events that are independent of the actual program. Rather than a universal clock signal, events in an asynchronous system synchronize activities (changes in the system). Asynchronous systems do not depend on foreign signals or messages to perform reliably.</div>
<p>Asynchronous systems are typically built using a modular design. Each module in such a network can operate autonomously while still interacting with others. These interconnected components eventually combine to produce a functioning solution/system.</p>
<div>An asynchronous communication refers to a process in which data is supplied sequentially instead of a continuous stream. Online forums or email are popular examples where individuals send messages at different times.</div>
<div>Asynchronous or semi-synchronous blockchain networks are widely used in the crypto industry. Because the networks don't give nodes any feedback on the status of the data they are transmitting. Nodes may have different opinions on the network's overall influence. Transaction throughput is increased since nodes do not have to stand in line for their messages to be processed by other nodes.</div>
<div>The objective of semi-synchronous networks is to prevent any splits in the global state of the network. That can cause the nodes' unanimity to be hindered. These networks prioritize reliability and accessibility. Promotion of accessibility will help all transactions to be executed without any delay. However, if a network chooses to emphasize consistency, some transactions may not be performed or delayed until all previous transactions have been confirmed.</div>

<title>Atomic Swap</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/atomic-swap</url>
<file>atomic-swap.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The transfer of cryptocurrency from one party to another, without the use of an exchange or other intermediary.</preview>
<description>
<div>Traditionally, in order to buy or sell a cryptocurrency, a user is required to use a centralized exchange. This arrangement has several drawbacks: both parties must find an exchange they trust, exchanges often suffer downtime during periods of high demand, and exchanges are subject to state oversight. </div>
<div>By contrast, an atomic swap enables direct wallet-to-wallet trading between two peers, using a specially designed smart contract for decentralized exchanges. </div>
<div>Atomic swaps offer a more decentralized alternative to trading on Automated Market Maker (AMM) DEXs like Uniswap, which rely upon centralized liquidity pools. AtomicDEX, one of the most popular atomic swap-powered DEXs, provides a true peer-to-peer order book system for crypto trading.</div>
<div>Atomic swaps are based on hash timelock contracts (HTLC). Every HTLC includes a hashlock, which can be used to lock and unlock the deposited currency with a key available only to the depositor, and a timelock, which automatically returns funds to the depositor if the transaction is not completed within a set timeframe.</div>
<p>Atomic swaps are designed in such a manner that when a swap takes place, either both parties receive the funds they desire or nothing happens at all and both parties retain the funds they started with (minus a very small transaction fee for the “order-taker”). Atomic swaps make digital asset trading as secure as it can possibly be..</p>
<p>In an example scenario, Party A creates an HTLC address and deposits their cryptocurrency. This creates a passcode, along with a hash of that code. Party A sends the hash to Party B, who uses it to generate an address. Party B deposits their cryptocurrency with that address. Because Party A has the passcode used to generate the hash, they can access the coins deposited by Party B. </p>
<p>At this point, the contract sends the passcode to Party B, who uses it to access the coins deposited by Party A. If the contracts are not signed within the specified timeframe, both deposits are automatically returned to the relevant depositor.</p>
<div>Atomic swaps can be used to trade on-chain across different blockchains with different native coins. Atomic swap technology is protocol agnostic, meaning it’s possible to swap assets like Bitcoin for Ethereum without having to trust the security of a wrapped token or centralized exchange. Off-chain atomic swaps offer significantly improved transaction speeds, but they have not yet been fully developed.</div>

<p>The evidence is always presented in the form of a receipt, an invoice or a bank statement.</p>
<div>An attestation ledger acts as a special business ledger to a single account.</div>
<p>The individual account can be an electronic commerce account such as a digital cryptocurrency wallet or a PayPal account.</p>
<p>Attestation ledgers act as proof that financial transactions have taken place.</p>
<p>They can also be extended to include statements or commitments which provide proof to third parties that commitments have been made.</p>
<p>The ledger has all types of records that are running in a blockchain based distributed network.</p>
<p>Attestation ledgers are a public distributed ledger that are used to confirm individual transactions.</p>
<p>One can put a transaction ID into the attestation ledger to confirm whether a transaction is valid or not.</p>
<p>Attestation ledgers can also be used by a Blockchain Operating Ledger System — also called BOLOS — when connecting a host computer to ensure that the device has not been altered or tampered with.</p>
<p>Attestation ledgers can also be used by applications to prove they are running on a legitimate ledger device.</p>

<preview>An auction is a public sale through a bidding process where an asset is sold to the highest bidder.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Auction?</h2>
<div>Auctions are live events in which a bidding mechanism is used to acquire a variety of things spanning from antiques to real estate. The auctioneer (person in charge of leading and directing the bidding process) will pitch an opening bid to the crowd when a (physical or digital) commodity is first displayed at the auction.</div>
<p>Once the bidding process commences, interested parties compete for the highest bid price until no one is eager to go any further. The highest bidder claims the ownership of the asset after paying for it as soon as the auctioneer acknowledges the last bid. </p>
<p>In any auction, a large number of potential bidders are typically preferred, since this increases the chances of offers being pushed up to higher levels for a successful sale.</p>
<div>Auctions have changed over time, but the fundamental concepts have remained the same. The procedure can start with a preview session, during which potential buyers can evaluate the commodities that attract them the most. To engage in the auction, there is typically a formalized registration system. Each bidder is issued a bidding card when they register with a unique identifier provided to them upon their enrollment into the event. </div>
<div>While most auctions are conducted in an ascending order, the so-called Dutch auctions are conducted in the reverse order. They begin with a hefty price tag and gradually decrease, until someone acknowledges the auctioneer's offer and the transaction is completed. In some circumstances, an auction comes with a predetermined limit price, which is the lowest amount that the commodity or service can be sold for. This price limit is also known as a reservation or reserve price.</div>
<div>As seen by online bidding platforms, technological advancements have helped to widen the environment for auctions. These websites make it easier to sell and trade things. Users may post images of their items while others can place bids on them in an attempt to get the product. When the time period for the item on the auction expires, the top bidder is contacted, just as in a traditional live auction, so they may finish payment and shipment arrangements.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrencies, among other items, may be sold at an auction. BTC auctions are quite popular since this cryptocurrency is sold at a lower price than the market at such events. These assets are usually forfeited by criminals during federal, civil and administrative cases and are up for auction. </div>
<p>Auctions open doors of amazing investment opportunities, the reason that has sparked so much interest in the crypto world.</p>
<div>To submit a bid, investors must first register and place a winning bid. After the auction is concluded for the particular cryptoasset, the winning bidder must pay through specified payment methods within a certain timeframe. To obtain the crypto asset, the winning bidder is also required to have a digital wallet, and in most cases also bear the transaction costs that may incur.</div>
<div>Electronic auctions, often known as e-auctions, are centralized, computerized auctions that make it easier to sell different types of assets. They are, unfortunately, prone to exploitation and fraud due to their centralized nature. </div>
<div>An alternative to simple electronic auctions are blockchain-based e-auction systems that eliminate corruption and improve security and efficiency.</div>
<div>Each auction's data is recorded in the blockchain and any change to the data is verified with a secure cryptographic &quot;digital signature&quot; that is broadcasted to a public blockchain for backup. Plus, the connection between servers is protected by a specific protocol. The digital signature changes if any data is changed. This allows everyone to double-check the bid information anytime and prevent anyone from hacking the auction data and changing the digital signatures, as this malicious effort would be detected and denied instantly by the blockchain network.</div>

<h2>What Is an Audit?</h2>
<div>An audit is a process where developers inspect the underlying code and/or algorithm that compose systems and applications, allowing them to spot potential bugs or points of failure before deployment. Audits are generally undertaken by third parties, which helps guarantee that the procedure is done in an unbiased and effective manner. </div>
<div>Auditing has become a common practice within the blockchain space, with numerous projects relying on the technique to ensure the security of their decentralized protocols’ smart contracts and give their users or token holders added peace of mind.</div>
<div>There are two ways to audit code: manual and automatic. Manual analysis is the most effective method of searching for coding errors. However, it takes more time and requires a mid-size development team to execute. Automatic code analysis enables quick but effective code assessment. While the latter is somewhat preferred by traditional businesses, manual code analysis is crucial for crypto projects since launching with undiscovered vulnerabilities could spell millions of lost funds, especially for DeFi projects.</div>
<div>A complete audit of a smart contract often consists of five important steps:</div>

<preview>Augmented Reality (AR) is an immersive experience that improves the value and usage of real-world items using computer-generated intuitive information sent through a variety of sensory modali</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Augmented Reality?</h2>
<div>Augmented Reality (AR) is generally characterized as a system that combines the real and virtual worlds and allows real-time interaction and precise 3D registration of virtual and real items/objects. It differs from virtual reality as it affects a person's experience of the world by improving or altering how it communicates with them rather than replacing their real-world environment with a virtual/digital one.</div>
<div>Augmented Reality (AR) has a significant place in the blockchain world. A great example to quote here would be the relation between AR and NFTs. </div>
<div>Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are a form of blockchain-based digital assets. NFTs, unlike other virtual currencies, are one-of-a-kind and cannot be replicated or traded for another of equal value (hence the name &quot;non-fungible&quot;). NFTs are analogous to Pokemon cards or uniquely manufactured coins in this aspect.</div>
<p>NFTs can be any digital item, such as music, movies, pictures, or even tweets.</p>
<div>AR NFTs incorporate AR components and signals, such as the capacity to visualize digital items in your surroundings or on your face/body, whereas normal NFTs are merely depictions of art pieces or moments in time (like photos or movies). 3D NFTs are digital items that may be viewed via augmented reality or other technologies.</div>
<p>To put it another way, AR NFTs and 3D NFTs are virtual reality experiences that can be shared through AR-enabled websites or applications.</p>
<p>Artists (visual artists, digital artists, musicians, video-makers, etc.), auctioneers, and merchants may all benefit from AR NFTs and 3D NFTs since they can produce new revenue streams.</p>
<div>Art NFTs also eliminate the need for middlemen by letting artists interact directly with their audience. Furthermore, unlike analog goods, digital collectibles are software, a fact that implies that when an NFT is resold, the original developer may get a royalty.</div>
<p>Creating your own NFTs is not complicated as you don’t need a lot of technical or crypto knowledge to do it. NFT markets abound, making it simple to transform your artwork (or anything else you've developed) into an NFT.</p>
<div>Developing an AR NFT or a 3D NFT, on the other hand, is a little bit difficult because it necessitates integrating visual signals that enable the digital object to appear in the actual environment. AR NFTs, on the other hand, have the potential to be more profitable. In a market where ordinary NFTs are quickly getting oversaturated, NFTs that allow users to engage in immersive experiences that can be shared with others are a guaranteed way to stand out from the crowd. </div>

<file>authentication.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Authentication is a process that confirms a user's identity using passwords, SMS codes, fingerprints, and other forms of ownership proofs before granting access to sensitive and/or personal i</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Authentication?</h2>
<div>Authentication is the confirmation of a user's degree of access to an account, platform, or private space. Users are typically recognized by a user ID, and authentication takes place when the user offers a credential, such as a password, that corresponds to that user ID. Most users are acquainted with using a password, which is referred to as a knowledge authentication factor since it is a piece of information that should be available only to the user. </div>
<div>Aside from guest accounts, auto logged-in accounts, and kiosk computer networks, most human-to-computer interactions have some form of user authentication. To access a system, a user must first pick a username or user ID and enter a valid password. User authentication authorizes human-to-machine interactions in operating systems and applications, as well as wired and wireless networks, allowing access to the network and internet-connected devices, applications, and resources.</div>
<div>Authentication is a method used by many organizations to verify users that connect to their websites. User data, such as credit and debit card information, as well as social security numbers (SSN), might get into the hands of hackers if proper security precautions are not taken.</div>
<div>The process of authentication is also used to recognize and regulate a user’s access to corporate networks, computers, servers and sensitive digital resources. It is also used by businesses to allow remote personnel secure access to their apps and networks.</div>
<div>Adding extra authentication elements to the verification process enhances security in most cases. A protocol is typically considered strong that entails the use of at least two factors, each of which is of a different type. Two-factor authentication is another name for it (2FA).</div>
<div>A user is encouraged by many organizations and exchanges to use two-factor authentication to safeguard their account data, especially in the world of cryptocurrency. The main reason for this is that, unlike your bank account, there is no fraudulent protection or method for recovering stolen assets if your crypto accounts get hacked!</div>
<p>It may take a little effort to learn and set up two-factor authentication, but the extra layer of security is definitely worth it.</p>
<div>Blockchain Authentication refers to systems that authenticate users' access to resources on multiple blockchains.</div>
<div>To secure wallets or the areas on the blockchain where currency or sensitive data is safely held, the blockchain employs public key cryptography (PKC). As a result, there are some fascinating parallels between blockchain technology and its security. Identity and access management (IAM) tools for blockchain usually come with cryptocurrency wallets as a primary feature, but you may end up compromising on the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) interface part.</div>
<div>It is worth noting that cryptography experts and blockchain developers sometimes have overlapping interests, making blockchain developers an essential component of the security and innovation environment.</div>
<p>The ecosystem was in dire need of the modernization of technology in the early days of Bitcoin adoption and blockchain use cases, so the wider public with less technical knowledge could start using it without compromising their privacy and security. One response to this call was password-protected wallet applications with high-level authentication protocols. A genuine password-less interface in digital currency wallets and blockchain apps will solve this problem and will welcome more people into the next phase of these technologies' development and real-world use cases.</p>

<file>automated-market-maker-amm.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>An automated market maker (AMM) is a system that provides liquidity to the exchange it operates in through automated trading.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Automated Market Maker?</h2>
<p>AMM systems took off after they were first implemented by Shearson Lehman Brothers and ATD in the early 1990s — before their invention, order books were created by humans who manually initiated trades meant to enhance the liquidity of the market.</p>
<p>This approach was the reason for some slippage and latency in price discovery on the markets. Furthermore, market makers were also accused of market manipulation. When introduced, AMMs solved all the issues caused by human market makers. Now, these types of systems are also being introduced in blockchain-based decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>On AMM-based decentralized exchanges, the traditional order book is replaced by liquidity pools that are pre-funded on-chain for both assets of the trading pair. The liquidity is provided by other users who also earn passive income on their deposit through trading fees based on the percentage of the liquidity pool that they provide.</p>
<p>One decentralized exchange that has implemented an AMM is Uniswap. Uniswap is an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange which allows its users to both supply liquidity to earn passive income or exchange between various assets.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Autonomous Economic Agent (AEA)?</h2>
<p>Fetch.ai is an artificial intelligence-based blockchain platform that uses AEA to connect with other AI applications for processing real-time data and taking actions based on that. </p>
<p>AEAs from fetch.ai connect with IOTA Streams, enabling the sharing and retrieval of real-time data to allow economic agents to act autonomously. One of the most common applications of AEAs could be financial markets where rapid and constant actions need to be taken for higher profits.</p>
<div>Autonomous Economic Agents aren’t APIs or smart contracts but they follow some rules autonomously without external input. Fetch.ai allows developers to create their own AEAs on the blockchain.</div>
<p>The term economic agent is commonly applied to human individuals, firms, or governments.</p>
<div>A typical example of an economic agent is a person engaged in some economic activity such as the purchase of consumer goods and services or the sale of a financial asset. More generally, an economic agent may be defined as any individual, group, or entity that makes decisions on the allocation of scarce resources.</div>
<p>However, in recent years, the term has been applied more widely to include non-human agents, such as bots. With its increasing use in this context, it is useful to examine the concept of an autonomous economic agent more closely.</p>
<p>The very definition of an autonomous agent implies that they are capable of self-governance and control over their own actions. In addition, since an autonomous agent operates independently from external control and supervision, it must have its own goals which it pursues through self-generated means.</p>
<p>Professional economists will immediately recognize these characteristics as the building blocks for any economic theory that deals with rational behavior by economic actors. For example, a central tenet in neo-classical economics is the assumption that all economic agents are rational actors who pursue their own personal goals without any external guidance or influence from outside sources such as government regulations or other external constraints.</p>

<title>Average Directional Index (ADX)</title>

<file>average-directional-index-adx.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The average directional index (ADX) is a technical indicator that measures how strong a market trend is by using price moving averages and is represented by figures ranging between 1 and 100,</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Average Directional Index (ADX)?</h2>
<div>The Average Directional Index, or ADX, is a tool for determining the comprehensive strength of a trend. It is based on the idea that trading, when the market is moving in the direction of a strong trend, increases the chances of profit and lowers the risk by a considerable margin. </div>
<div>Welles Wilder invented the ADX indicator for daily commodity charts, but it is currently used by technical traders and financial experts in a wide range of markets to identify the strength of trends.</div>
<div>Average Directional Movement Index (ADX) is termed as a non-directional indicator that measures trend strength, regardless of whether prices are going up or down. The Directional Movement System, which includes the DMI+ and DMI- indicators as well as the ADX, seeks to assess the strength of price movement in both positive and negative directions. A single line represents ADX with readings ranging from 0 to 100. The indicator is (mostly) exhibited in the same window as the two directional movement indicator (DMI) lines, which are used to calculate ADX.</div>
<p>The general interpretation of the values is as follows:</p>
<h2>How to Calculate the Average Directional Index (ADX)</h2>
<p>Please follow the following steps to calculate the value of Average Directional Index (ADX) indicator:</p>
<p>1. Calculate Directional Movement (+DM) using the formula:</p>
<p>+DM = Current High - Previous High</p>
<p>2. Calculate -DM using:</p>
<p>-DM = Previous Low - Current Low</p>
<p>3. Now choose between +DM and -DM by selecting the one with a higher value.</p>
<p>4. Calculate the True Range (TR) by using either of the following:</p>
<p>Current high - Current low; Current low - Previous close; Current high - Previous close</p>
<p>5. Calculate the smoothed 14-period averages of the TR, the +DM, and –DM by using:</p>
<p>First 14TR = Sum of first 14 TR readings</p>
<p>Next 14TR = first 14TR – (prior 14TR/14) + current TR</p>
<p>6. Now calculate the +DI and -DM values by using:</p>
<p>+DI = (Smoothed +DM / ATR) x 100 </p>
<p>-DI = (Smoothed -DM / ATR) x 100</p>
<p>7. Now you can calculate the directional movement index (DMI) by using the following equation:</p>
<p>DX = ( | +DI - -DI |  / | +DI + -DI | ) x 100  </p>
<p>8. To calculate ADX you have to determine the DX for all 14 periods, and to calculate the first ADX, you should divide the sum of all 14 periods of DX by 14. For the remaining 13, use the following formula:</p>
<p>ADX = (Previous ADX x 13) + Current ADX) / 14</p>
<div>Note: The entire process is automated during trading, so you don’t need to perform each of the calculations above yourself. </div>
<div>Other popular trading indicators include on-balance volume (OBV), accumulation/distribution line, MACD and RSI.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Crypto slang for a large quantity of a specific cryptocurrency. Alternatively (but less frequently) used to refer to the contents of an individual's crypto portfolio.</preview>
<description>
<div>In the first definition, there is no generally agreed-upon threshold at which someone's crypto holding becomes a bag, but it is generally considered to refer to a higher-than-average quantity of that coin. Extremely large holdings of a specific cryptocurrency are sometimes referred to as “heavy bags.”The term is useful in distinguishing between different coins or tokens within an individual's overall portfolio. An investor might have well-performing and poorly performing bags — depending on the market conditions for each asset in question. In these cases, 'bag' is closely related to the term 'bagholder', referring to an investor who does not sell their holding of a specific coin or token, even if it experiences dramatic drops in value.See also: Bagholder.</div>

<preview>An investor who continues to hold large amounts of a specific coin or token, regardless of its performance.</preview>
<description>
<div>Bagholders do not sell their assets — even if its price drops to zero.</div>
<p>There are several potential reasons for this. The most simple is that the investor believes the potential long-term gain will outweigh any immediate losses. Alternatively, they may be laboring under the sunk cost fallacy.</p>
<div>Bagholders are also sometimes affected by the “disposition effect.” This refers to the practice of refusing to sell poorly performing assets, but realizing gains in other assets very quickly.Perhaps most commonly though, bagholders may simply be too time poor (or lack the interest or enthusiasm) to keep up with the performance of the assets they hold. This is likely to have become much more common as cryptocurrencies went increasingly mainstream.</div>
<p>News stories about price fluctuations have been accompanied by huge spikes in crypto investment among people who have no previous experience in this asset class. Inevitably, many of these investors lose interest again over time — especially if their investment was not large. </p>
<div>This can pay dividends. There have been many stories of first-time investors who bought Bitcoin many years ago, forgot about it, and then discovered that they were sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars — and sometimes even millions.Bagholding is closely related to HODLing. The latter term has become more commonly used to refer to holding on to coins or tokens because the trader is not skilled or informed enough to adopt another strategy. HODL was coined following a misspelling by the user GameKyuubi on the BitcoinTalk forum, but it is now also used as an acronym for “Hold On for Dear Life.”</div>

<preview>Baking is the process that Tezos uses in order to append new blocks of transactions to its blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Bakers?</h2>
<div>Baking is the process that Tezos uses in order to append new blocks of transactions to its blockchain. This is a delegated-proof-of-stake system, where bakers receive rewards for each block that is baked, in a similar sense as to how Bitcoin miners end up getting rewarded for discovering new blocks.</div>
<p>A baker is more likely to bake a block if they have a larger number of rolls.</p>
<p>The accounts have to be registered as a delegate in order to partake in the baking process, and can actually bake on behalf of others who do not meet the 10,000 XTZ requirements.</p>
<p>Baking can be defined as the act of validating Tezos network transactions: this act of validation is called mining for proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin while being called validating for proof-of-stake blockchain such as EOS.</p>
<p>For the efforts when it comes to validating the transactions as well as securing the networks, bakers end up earning Tez or XTZ tokens.</p>
<p>Tezos is a platform for smart contracts as well as decentralized applications, which are known as DApps.</p>
<p>DPoS is an algorithm that allows virtual mining instead of physical mining. Virtual mining is a lot more convenient as well as a lot more energy-efficient.</p>
<p>Baking is essentially the act of signing and publishing new blocks within the Tezos blockchain, and you need to be a qualified delegate to do so by getting 10,000 XTZ. After fulfilling this requirement, any user can become a baker or an endorser.</p>
<p>Bakers get a reward for their work, 16 XTZ per block.</p>
<p>Endorsers, on the other hand, are the people who verify the block after it has been baked, and they check if everything is done correctly. They get 2 XTZ.</p>

<h2>What Is Baking?</h2>
<p>Baking is a process that is used by Tezos in order to append new blocks of transactions onto its blockchain. This is a delegated-proof-of-stake system, where bakers receive rewards for each block that is baked.</p>
<p>Now, in order to conduct the baking process, or n other words, in order to become the baker, you will need to have 10,000 XTZ, which is the native currency on the Tezos blockchain. Once you collect or earn 10,000 XTZ, you can either become a baker, or an endorser.</p>
<p>Now, since we are discussing the baking process, let's assume you have selected to become a baker. Bakers, by running a full-note in order to maintain the network produce new blocks in the Tezos blockchain, and as such, get rewards with additional XTZ tokens.</p>
<p>To explain the process of baking further, you need to understand that there are two main types of Tezos blockchain accounts.</p>
<p>First, you have implicit accounts, which are the only accounts that are allowed to be a part of the baking process. Here, you have the ability to either bake with your own balance or through a delegated account or delegated accounts.</p>
<p>Then you have originated accounts, which are the ones that can be delegated. These cannot become a part of the baking process, and there is a special delicate key that allows partaking in the consensus algorithm. Keep in mind that delegates can also be reassigned.</p>

<file>bandwidth.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>The quantity of data capacity available for transactional activity on a network is known as bandwidth.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Bandwidth?</h2>
<div>Bandwidth is quantified by the number of megabytes or gigabytes per second processed on a network. When the bandwidth limit on a network is reached, the data flow becomes insufficient to manage the volume, and connections slow down.</div>
<div>In simple terms, bandwidth refers to how much data you get per second, whereas speed refers to how quickly that data is processed or downloaded. Let's use the example of filling a bathtub. More water can flow at a faster pace if the bathtub faucet is larger than usual. Consider water is bandwidth and the pace at which it flows is the speed. Bandwidth is sometimes confused with internet speed, although it refers to the quantity of data that can be transferred through a connection in a given length of time (quantified in megabits per second) (Mbps).</div>
<p>You'll need extra bandwidth to keep up the speed if you have many devices connected to the internet at the same time. To achieve the expected experience without a lot of buffering or latency, streaming, gaming, and other high-capacity activities require a specific level of internet speed. The more bandwidth your internet provider can supply, the faster you will be able to get things done.</p>
<div>Tokenization of bandwidth is achievable with the blockchain technology. Tokenization transforms it into a marketable and divisible asset, where its trading is similar to smart banking and digital money, thanks to the internet and the blockchain network. However, in this situation, you would be exchanging bits per second instead of money.</div>
<p>In terms of longevity, the physical infrastructure intended to manage bandwidth is made to endure everything that comes its way. Regardless of what some internet service providers claim, bandwidth is a limited resource. Because of its scarcity, it is extremely valuable.</p>
<div>While the cost of producing bandwidth is expensive, it has inherent worth, unlike paper or digital money. For example, the internet relies on it to function and survive in this world. There is an ever-increasing need for computing resources, such as bandwidth, courtesy of the high and steep demand for technologies such as big data, analytics, and the internet of things. Only in the rare case of a drop in technology use will bandwidth deflation happen. Instead, if local businesses and individuals become involved in constructing the necessary infrastructure, a gradual increase over time would be observed because it is difficult to simply generate additional bandwidth as the currency retains its worth.</div>
<p>The bandwidth would function as a form of currency on a decentralized network, unlike Dollar. Like bitcoin, bandwidth may enable complete transparency and security without the need for a centralized financial institution.</p>
<p>In reality, humans have utilized a variety of substances as a kind of exchange. A stable currency, on the other hand, must have the following characteristics: trustworthiness, longevity, divisibility, and uniformity. It should also be rare, clearly identifiable, and challenging to counterfeit.</p>
<div>As a result, bandwidth has the potential to become a super currency that can function without the presence of a central bank.</div>
<p>The main issue with bandwidth is the currency's trustworthiness. A physical, virtual, electronic, or abstract currency cannot survive without trust and belief in the system. </p>
<div>Regardless, bandwidth is valuable and can help to enhance technological advancement in the blockchain industry. Although bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, the advent of blockchain has made it possible to tokenize and exchange practically anything of value. Developing a currency to power the future of computers can help humanity advance technologically.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)?</h2>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is an international financial institution that has the main goal of promoting global monetary as well as financial stability through coordinating global central banks as well as their monetary policy efforts.</p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is often called the central bank for central banks, due to the fact that it provides many of the banking services to institutions such as the European Central Bank as well as the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>These services can include things such as conducting gold and currency transactions as well as allowing them to make short-term collateralized loans.</p>
<p>The BIS also aims to encourage cooperation across central banks.</p>
<p>Discussing its history, it was originally founded in 1930 as a clearinghouse for the German war reparations which were imposed by the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>The original BIS members were Japan, Italy, Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and the U.S. Reparations were discontinued after the bank was founded, and the BIS managed to become a forum for cooperation and a counterparty for transactions across central banks.</p>
<p>As an organization of the central banks, the BIS’s main goal to make the monetary policy predictable as well as transparent across the 60-member central banks.</p>
<p>Now, while monetary policy is determined by most sovereign nations, it is still subject to central as well as private banking scrutiny as well as the potential for speculation, which affects foreign exchange rates and the rate of export economies. Here is where BIS aims to keep the monetary policy in line with reality and help implement any monetary reforms on time, as a simultaneous policy across all 60 member banks as well as the involvement of the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<h2>What Is Banking as a Service (BaaS)?</h2>
<p>Banking as a service or BaaS platforms provides a higher level of financial transparency options by letting banks open up their APIs for third parties in order to develop new services.</p>
<p>BaaS platforms have surfaced as a key component in open banking, in which firms provide financial transparency options for account holders through opening their application programming interfaces or APIs for third parties in order for them to develop new services.</p>
<p>This is essentially the end-to-end model in which digital banks, as well as other third parties, are allowed to connect with the systems of banks directly through APIs, and can build banking offerings on top of the providers' regulated infrastructure and can even unlock an open banking opportunity.</p>
<p>The BaaS model essentially starts with a fintech, digital bank or another form of third-party provider paying a fee in order to access the BaaS platform. Here, the financial institution opens its APIs to the TPP, where they are granted access to the systems as well as information that is required to build new banking products or offer white label banking services.</p>
<p>Legacy institutions can also launch their own BaaS platforms, and these are in turn opening up new revenue streams for them.</p>
<p>Monetization strategies include charging clients a monthly fee for access to the BaaS platform or charging for each service that is used.</p>
<p>This differs from blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS), which refers to third-party cloud-based infrastructure and management for companies building, as well as operating blockchain apps through running the back-end operation for a blockchain-based app or platform.</p>

<title>Banking Secrecy Act (BSA)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/banking-secrecy-act-bsa</url>
<file>banking-secrecy-act-bsa.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) was implemented in the United States in 1970 to prevent criminals from concealing or laundering their illegal gains.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Banking Secrecy Act (BSA)?</h2>
<div>Also known as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, the Banking Secrecy Act (BSA) requires banks and other financial institutions to disclose records such as currency transaction statements and financial history of accounts to regulated authorities. When the account holders of banks engage with money transfers involving amounts over $10,000, documentation and verification become a pressing need. Authorities are able to detect and prevent money laundering, thanks to the Bank Secrecy Act.</div>
<div>The legislation does not mandate that all the transactions worth more than $10,000 be recorded. Per the Internal Revenue Service, every individual in a trade or company who gets more than $10,000 only in cash from a single purchase is required to submit ‘’Form 8300’’. This might be the outcome of a single transaction or a series of linked transactions. An individual, a firm, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a trust, or an estate may be subject to the regulation.</div>
<div>The rule dictates that by the 15th day after the cash transaction is made, ‘’Form 8300’’ must be submitted to the relevant authorities. This requirement applies to any portion of the monetary transaction that takes place in the United States, its possessions, or territories.</div>
<p>There are a number of exclusions in the law that do not need such assessment. Exempt parties include government departments or agencies, as well as corporations listed on major North American exchanges.</p>
<div>While the BSA has been praised for its effectiveness in combating illegal behavior, it has been criticized for the lack of rules that specify what exactly is considered as ‘suspect transaction’. To acquire access to the information, law enforcement authorities do not need a court order.</div>
<div>The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies has prompted debates on whether and how firms dealing with transactions utilizing new financial vehicles, such as bitcoin and altcoins, should be obliged to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act.</div>
<div>For some, the amount of secrecy that virtual, encrypted transactions accompany is the most appealing aspect of cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, on the flip side of the coin, the ability to perform untraceable transactions and keep crypto coins in “wallets” rather than banks have made virtual currency an appealing tool for criminals and launderers to carry out unlawful operations.</div>
<div>The federal government has made efforts to provide greater control and visibility to bitcoin transactions as a result of an increase in the usage of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities.</div>
<p>Companies and individuals who are operating in the grey area of the law and are not clear about their position as money transmitters, will undoubtedly be unsure of their legal obligation to submit their data to the federal authorities. </p>
<p>The first step for organizations and people who find themselves in difficult and unclear legal circumstances involving cryptocurrencies and the Bank Secrecy Act is to contact a white-collar defense attorney who has an expertise in virtual currency cases. Laws governing cryptocurrency are always changing. As a result, legal concerns arising from digital currency transactions necessitate the aid of an attorney with both technical subject-matter knowledge of how cryptocurrencies operate and their legal status.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Basket?</h2>
<div>A basket, when used in the cryptocurrency space, refers to a collection of digital currencies managed as a single asset, minimizing the need for holders to monitor individual currencies continuously. A crypto basket is also used interchangeably with a crypto index fund. </div>
<div>Crypto asset baskets gained momentum in 2018, which started by enabling the grouping of multiple coins and offering a single token to facilitate trading. Listing the token on an exchange allows users to trade it as a standard cryptocurrency. </div>
<div>Although the product initially targeted novice traders, it now includes options for experienced users. For instance, the Coinbase Index Fund is focused on large-scale crypto investors and consists of the top coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC).</div>
<div>A basket can take many shapes and forms depending on its guiding theme. For instance, it can include all top proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptos, respectively. Others can bring together ERC-20 tokens targeting a particular subsection, such as decentralized finance (DeFi).</div>
<div>Other crypto index funds like the JPMorgan Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket take a different approach. Instead of directly putting together a group of coins, it tracks the shares of several companies interacting with cryptocurrency. Some of the companies in its basket include Microstrategy, Nvidia, Riot Blockchain, and Square.</div>
<p>Notably, assets in a basket can have different percentages, with one or a couple of assets taking the lion’s share. In the case of JPMorgan, Microstrategy takes 20%, Nvidia 15% and Riot Blockchain 18%.</p>

<preview>Batch auctions are a trading mechanism in which individual orders are grouped together and executed simultaneously.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Batch Auctions?</h2>
<p>Batch auctions are a trading mechanism in which individual orders are grouped together and executed simultaneously. All orders within a batch are settled at the same uniform clearing price. Batch auctions benefit from aggregated liquidity and are a popular mechanism for ensuring fair price discovery in both the decentralized and traditional finance worlds. </p>
<p>In the context of blockchains, batch auctions play an important role for initial token offerings, liquidations or buybacks of illiquid assets and as a means to prevent MEV. Batch auctions are fundamentally less vulnerable to MEV since the ordering of trades within a batch doesn’t have an effect on the price.</p>
<p>While traditionally batch auctions operate on a single token pair (like order books), a special case — referred to as multi-dimensional batch auction — allows for orders between multiple token pairs to be settled in the same batch. This is particularly beneficial for fragmented token spaced (e.g. USD-stablecoins) or less liquid token paris (e.g. certain insurance or prediction market outcome token) as trades don’t have to happen between direct counterparties, but can also happen in rings:</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A blockchain that coordinates shard chains, manages staking and the registry of validators in a PoS cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum 2.0.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Beacon Chain?</h2>
<div>The Beacon Chain lies at the core of Ethereum 2.0; it stores and manages the registry of validators and coordinates the shard chains. The Beacon Chain went live on Dec. 1, 2020 at noon UTC.</div>
<p>The Beacon Chain is a brand-new, proof-of-stake blockchain. It can be poetically described as the spine that supports the whole of the new Ethereum 2.0 system, the heartbeat that keeps the system alive, the conductor coordinating all the players. Another good metaphor is to think of the Beacon Chain as of a big lighthouse, rising above a blue sea of transaction data. It’s constantly scanning, validating, collecting votes and doling out rewards to the validators that correctly attest to blocks, deducting rewards for those not online and slashing the ETH rewards from malicious actors. </p>
<div>The key function of the Beacon Chain is to manage the proof-of-stake protocol itself and all of the shard chains. There are a number of aspects to this: managing validators and their stakes; nominating the chosen block proposer for each shard at each step; organizing validators into committees to vote on the proposed blocks; applying the consensus rules; applying rewards and penalties to validators; and, being an anchor point on which the shards register their states to facilitate cross-shard transactions. The important note though is that the Beacon chain cannot run smart contracts, that’s what the shard chains will be for.</div>
<div>The Beacon Chain is the coordination mechanism of the new network, responsible for creating new blocks, making sure those new blocks are valid and rewarding validators with ETH for keeping the network secure. Proof-of-stake has long been part of Ethereum’s roadmap, and addresses some of the weaknesses of proof-of-work blockchains such as accessibility, centralization and scalability. Instead of miners expending energy to validate blocks, randomly selected validators (each containing their stake of 32 ETH) propose new blocks, which are voted on by other validators. </div>
<p>With the Beacon Chain and proof-of-stake system now in place, the next stage of Ethereum 2.0 is establishing shard chains, which will upgrade Ethereum’s data capacity, making the network faster and more scalable. Ethereum 2.0 will spread the network load across 64 separate shards, with one Beacon Chain to rule them all.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Someone who believes that prices in a given market will decline over an extended period. Such a person might be referred to as “bearish.”</preview>
<description>
<p>While a bear is an individual who is cautious or pessimistic, the related term “bear market” describes a market that is experiencing significant downward pressure over a sustained period of time. </p>
<div>In a bear market, traders are more likely to sell than to buy. Many coins have endured high-profile bear market conditions. The most famous may be the 410-day Bitcoin decline seen between 2013 and 2015.There are many potential reasons why someone might adopt a bearish outlook, and these can vary significantly by coin or token. </div>
<div>Mainstream financial commentators and many institutional investors are extremely forthright in their bearish predictions for cryptocurrencies. Despite the enormous gains seen across many digital currencies over the years, many of these individuals maintain that crypto's momentum is unsustainable. </div>
<div>Critics often argue that blockchain technology has not and will never prove to have “real world” utility, and that crypto prices will collapse when this is recognized. </div>
<div>Elsewhere, particularly among dedicated crypto traders, a bearish outlook might accompany specific events. In Bitcoin, for example, bear markets tend to precede halving events, which in turn tend to trigger bull markets — that is, a period of sustained upswings.Bear markets should not be confused with price corrections. This refers to a decline in the price of an asset or security of more than 10% when compared with its most recent peak. A price correction may trigger a bear market, or it may be short-lived.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>When prices of assets in a market fall by 20% or more from recent highs, it is called a bear market. As a result, investor confidence is low, and the economy and market turn pessimistic.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bear Market?</h2>
<p>A bear market is defined as a market that has lost 20% of its value in the last few months from its previous high point. It is frequently triggered by an economic downturn or a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence that has an economic impact, such as the new Coronavirus.</p>
<h2>Why Is It Called a Bear Market?</h2>
<p>Some speculate that the bear market got its name from an old saying about not selling a bear's skin before catching the bear. Others believe that the term is named after the way a bear attacks its prey by swiping its paws downward.</p>
<h2>How Long Does a Bear Market Last?</h2>
<p>The fact is that bear markets occur from time to time. Since WWII, Wall Street has had 13 bear markets (every five or six years on average), with each one lasting around 362 days—just over a year.</p>
<p>Now, a bear market normally corrects itself, and the economy recovers rather fast. However, if stock values continue to decrease, a recession may result. When the economy stops expanding for a lengthy period of time—usually two quarters or more of negative economic growth—this is known as a recession.</p>
<h2>Bear market vs Market Correction vs Pullback</h2>
<p>A pullback is a 5% to 10% reduction in price that is merely temporary, generally lasting a few days or weeks. It's like going through a usual adjustment period, with a small detour from a recent high but no change in the underlying trend.</p>
<div>A market correction occurs when prices drop by 10% to 20% and last in that zone for two to four months. These periods are extremely volatile, and they might cause investors to fear a bear market and sell. Real-time news can exacerbate these concerns, since investors may be influenced by crowd psychology and make anticipatory judgments.</div>
<p>A bear market occurs when prices fall by 20% or more, and it can persist anywhere from months to years. Investors’ trust gets damaged and the majority of them exit the market. As more investors sell their equities in order to avoid more losses, trading activity decreases.</p>
<h2>Examples of Notable Bear Markets</h2>
<p>Let's look at some of the most well-known and severe bear markets, starting with the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The Great Depression, which began in 1929, was one of the world's most extended and severe economic downturns. The global economy did not begin to revive until the late 1930s. Some claim the 1929 US stock market crisis was the spark, while others argue it was more of a consequence than a cause.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Crash of 1929 was a sharp and unexpected drop in stock values on the New York Stock Exchange. This was followed by the London Stock Exchange Crash, all of which signified the start of the Great Depression, which was followed by the &quot;Roaring Twenties,&quot; a period of luxury following World War I.</p>
<p>The fall was caused by excessive anticipation that the market would continue to rise as more individuals began to participate. </p>
<p>The late 1990s were a time of rapid expansion for numerous new tech businesses, notably Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Yahoo!, as the internet's widespread use fueled the market expansion. The S&amp;P 500 increased by nearly 400% before plummeting by 49% in March 2000.</p>
<p>Prices were driven so high by over-speculation and positive market enthusiasm that they could no longer be justified. As investors continued to pour money into dot-com stocks, supply began to outstrip demand. Despite the fact that more firms wanted to go public, sometimes without a good plan, they nonetheless managed to attract investors to unproductive operations.</p>
<p>The global financial crisis of 2007–2008 was the worst bear market since the Great Depression, owing to the housing crisis and financial institutions' excessive risk-taking. The recession came to a head in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, triggering a global banking crisis.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 lost approximately half of its value as a result of these events, but the market began to rise again in 2009 and entered a bull market that lasted until February 2020.</p>
<p>In December 2017, Bitcoin went from about $20,000 to just over $3,200 in a matter of days, making it one of the most well-known crypto crashes. Following that, it rose in price, hitting approximately $65,000 per coin in April 2021, before plummeting to below $32,000 in May.</p>

<title>Bear Trap</title>

<file>bear-trap.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The attempted manipulation of a specific cryptocurrency’s price, based on the coordinated activity of a group of traders.</preview>
<description>
<div>A bear trap will generally involve a number of traders who have significant combined holdings of a cryptocurrency. </div>
<div>Together, they will arrange to sell a large amount of that coin at the same time. The intention is to persuade other market participants that a price correction is taking place and for them to sell their own holdings in response — thus driving prices down even further. </div>
<div>At this point the bear trap will be “released” — and the group will buy back their assets at the lower price. The value of the coin then rebounds, and the trap setters have made a profit.Bear traps originated on the stock market. However, in this context, the term is used to describe both the technique and the specific technical indication of a reversal in a market downtrend. </div>
<div>They can occur over several days or within a matter of hours, and begin when the demand for stocks outweighs the number of holders willing to sell. The buyers then increase their bids — attracting more sellers and pushing the market upwards. </div>
<p>Stock holders only realize profits when they sell the shares, meaning that higher rates of acquisition also increase pressure to sell. In response, institutional investors dump stock in the hope that less-skilled market participants will sell their own stock too, pushing prices down. </p>
<p>When prices have fallen to the institutions' desired level, they then buy back large amounts of the stock — pushing prices back up and making a profit.</p>

<p>A trader that was nicknamed “BearWhale” was sighted in 2014. This person was a Bitcoin collector that was trying to sell 30,000 Bitcoin all at once at a price of $300 per coin, or $9 million in total. Nobody at the time knew why this was the case, or why they were so eager to sell their currency. This huge sell, however, was placed through Bitstamp and was so large that it ended up distorting the Bitcoin markets and temporarily put up a wall that caused the price of Bitcoin to stall at $300 for hours while all 30,000 of the seller’s coins started selling.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is A Benchmark?</h2>
<div>In a nutshell, a benchmark is a baseline that serves as a reference point. It is an informed assessment metric used in the financial industry to assess the performance of a certain asset or investment portfolio. Indexes, which are essentially financial instruments and used to reflect a set of individual market prices or a collection of data points, are one of the most popular types of benchmarks.</div>
<div>For a number of asset types, such as securities, bonds, stocks, and cryptocurrencies, several benchmarks have been developed. The S&amp;P 500 index, which measures the market capitalization of 500 big US firms, is a popular example of a benchmark. A qualified committee chooses these firms based on a weighted formula.</div>
<div>In the world of computer science, a benchmark is a term that refers to the process of executing several computer processes and software to assess the relative performance of a product or service. Many benchmarking tools are commercialized as software that are particularly designed to evaluate huge volumes of data.</div>
<p>Benchmarks are also employed in the context of business analysis as a technique that frequently includes the measurement and comparison of company behavior and performance - either against what would be deemed the most productive or acceptable practice or against other highly successful firms.</p>
<p>The process of benchmarking includes:</p>
<p>Some examples of popular benchmarks include:</p>
<p>This form of benchmarking allows you to see how your processes stack up against others present in your industry. You can enhance your procedures and make them more productive and cost-effective by looking at other firms in the sector.</p>
<p>Strategic benchmarking, like process benchmarking, is all about using competitors’ strategies to improve certain aspects of your organization. Strategic benchmarking is concerned with strategy and how to develop one that will help you get to the top in your industry.</p>
<p>It is the most difficult process to optimize since it entails learning about competitors' performance measurements and procedures, as well as making adjustments to lower-level processes inside your company. In every firm, introducing new procedures is a difficult task since it needs buy-in from many different levels. Performance benchmarking may reveal insights that would be difficult to execute in an organization without a long-term transformation strategy. These may also be the most effective and profitable improvements for a business.</p>
<div>Blockchain is a prominent decentralized application paradigm, particularly in the world of finance and trade. Benchmarking is a popular method for comparing industry-standard systems that makes it increasingly crucial as blockchain technology continues to evolve.</div>
<div>There is still a huge demand for benchmarks in the blockchain sector. These would ideally be based on scientific research and may be used as measuring standards for a range of blockchain properties, such as network speed and scalability, the degree of decentralization, the efficiency of various consensus methods, and the performance of smart contracts.</div>

<preview>A benchmark index is a popular index security that is used as a gauge or benchmark, against which the progress of the broader market may be tracked.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Benchmark Index?</h2>
<div>A benchmark index is a collection of securities that are used to evaluate the results of other assets in the market. They are stock market performance benchmarks for mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and other assets. Different but roughly comparable indexes are used to evaluate how well or poorly assets function in the market for all sorts of asset classes. The S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and Russell 3000 are all examples of popular benchmark indexes.</div>
<div>Benchmarks are essential while investing in businesses because they allow individual investors to assess the success of their investments. Different kinds of markets and features are covered by these indexes where standards for large, mid-size, and small-cap companies are different. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are two well-known stock market indexes. Fixed income, for example, has its own benchmarks, including the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the Barclays Capital U.S. Treasury Bond Index, and a few others as well. Lipper indices are one of the benchmarks used by mutual funds.</div>
<div>In the investing sector, a benchmark is important as it serves as a critical indicator for portfolio and fund management. Before investing in a company, security, or asset, investors and investment managers use these indexes to evaluate its performance. </div>
<div>Benchmark investing strategies are divided into two categories: smart beta funds and passive investment funds. These tools have successfully responded to various changes that have emerged in the investing sector. When it comes to picking the different types of securities to invest in, active managers also make extensive use of these tools.</div>
<div>The passive investment fund approach allows investors to acquire exposure to benchmarking system. Benchmark investments, in principle, provide investors with the information they need to make educated selections when it comes to stocks, bonds, and other assets to invest in. </div>
<div>A great example of benchmark indexes in the world of blockchain would be HFR Blockchain Index Methodology. It consists of a set of benchmarks created to represent the success of fund managers who participate in blockchain projects and shared ledger technology.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrency and infrastructure technologies are two sub-strategies of the Blockchain approach. Cryptocurrency fund managers employ a range of trading methods in order to benefit from exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies.</div>
<p>Infrastructure managers put their money into businesses that are creating blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, which are essentially disintermediating payment systems, banking, market trading structures, IoT, healthcare, remittances, supply chains, digital identification, and more. The HFR Blockchain Indices are readjusted every three months where all index constituents are evenly weighted at the moment of rebalancing.</p>
<p>A fund must meet the following criteria to be considered for inclusion in the HFR Blockchain Indices:</p>
<p>In general, benchmark indexes are a great way of comparing the performance of your asset or investment portfolio and adjust them according to the way they perform over a certain period.</p>

<preview>A technical standard for tokens on Binance Chain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is BEP-2 (Binance Chain Tokenization Standard)?</h2>
<div>BEP-2 stands for Binance Chain Evolution Proposal 2. BEP-2 is a technical standard for creating and using new tokens on Binance Chain. It defines a set of rules and technical specifications that tokens should follow to function in the Binance Chain ecosystem. A very similar token standard in the Ethereum blockchain is ERC-20. For more details on the original proposal, you can refer to the Binance project’s GitHub page. </div>
<div>While the BEP-2 standard defines the basic and most essential features of tokens issued on Binance Chain, different tokens can still have different implementations for the specific use cases they’re created for. BEP-2 tokens can represent a wide range of digital assets and tradable goods. The standard ensures that they can all smoothly integrate with each other and the surrounding ecosystem. There are BEP-2 stablecoins like, BUSD, BEP-2 pegged Bitcoin BEP-2 and as well as many more multichain projects are using the benefits of BEP-2.</div>
<div>The Binance Chain hosting the BEP-2 tokens relies on the Tendermint BFT consensus and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) with a dedicated application layer that runs upon it. These two consensus algorithms proved to be a fast and reliable alternative to proof-of-work.</div>
<p>Each BEP-2 token has the following properties:</p>
<div>To learn more about the Binance Chain architecture in detail, you can check the project documentation here.</div>
<div>The native asset of Binance Chain is BNB, which is used to pay for fees (similar to gas). This means that when you’d like to transfer your BEP-2 tokens, you’ll also need to have a small amount of BNB in your wallet. This provides an incentive for validators to include the transactions in the blockchain, as they’ll collect the BNB as a fee for their troubles. </div>
<div>While the Binance Chain is optimised for ultra-fast trading, it has a sister chain, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that is focused on running smart contacts and decentralized applications without congesting the original chain. Both chains are complementary to one another in one ecosystem, but are de facto independent. Because of this dual chain architecture, heavy emphasis was placed on cross-chain compatibility. For that reason, BEP-2 tokens can be easily swapped for their BEP-20 equivalent. </div>
<div>BEP-2 tokens can be traded on Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange that’s running on top of Binance Chain.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is BEP-20?</h2>
<p>BEP-20 is a Binance Smart Chain token standard created with the intention of extending ERC-20, which is one of the most common Ethereum token standards out there. BEP-20 is a blueprint as to how a token can be spent, who can spend it, and it even has rules about its overall usage.</p>
<div>The BEP-20 standard was both derived from and fully compatible with the ERC-20 standard, and the code of the functions that define the BEP-20 standard are modifications of the ERC-20 standard. </div>
<p>These modifications were done and intended to improve the protocol while also optimizing its speed as well as transaction cost. In fact, BEP-20 was conceived as this technical specification for the Binance Smart CHain with the goal of actually providing a flexible format through which many developers can launch different tokens. These tokens could represent anything from shares within a business to dollars, which are stored in a bank vault such as stablecoins.</p>
<div>You could create a native asset as a BEP-20 token and even peg tokens from other blockchains in order to make them usable on the = Binance Smart Chain.</div>
<p>Creating a BSC token is easy, and the tokens conform to a standard which is known as BEP020, which ensures basic functionality for the token, such as transferring, returning a balance, viewing the token ownership, and so on.</p>

<preview>BEP-721 is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token standard that enables the generation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It is considered to be an extension of ERC-721 that is one of the most popular</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is BEP-721?</h2>
<div>The Ethereum network was the first to develop a standard for non-fungible tokens. The ‘ERC-721' token symbolizes ownership of NFTs, such as real estate or collectibles, where each token holds a distinct value.</div>
<div>As the buzz surrounding non-fungible tokens grew, so did the range of diverse ecosystems that sprung up with them. This tendency has intensified since the Ethereum network's exorbitantly high fees and long transaction processing times have curtailed its functionality and rendered many DeFi protocols unusable.</div>
<div>BEP-721 is a modification to Ethereum's ERC-721, one of the most widely used NFT standards. Each NFT is one-of-a-kind and cannot be exchanged for another token. BEP-721 tokens can be used to tokenize data ownership and assign a unique identity to it. This feature distinguishes these tokens from other BEP-20 tokens. Developers may use BEP-20 to generate many identical tokens within a single smart contract. However, BEP-721 assigns a unique ID to each token. They may be used to represent specific non-fungible objects owing to their uniqueness. The feature of “tokenMetadata” allows metadata to be included in a token that is used to link to a piece of artwork or another collectible feature of the NFT. They can be traded and transferred based on their market value that is determined by the scarcity or usage.</div>
<div>The majority of NFTs and DeFi platforms, particularly Binance Smart Chain, demand buyers to have a digital wallet and pay for these assets using cryptocurrencies. If users do not have a digital wallet, like a MetaMask wallet, they are required to create one to easily interact with BSC projects.</div>
<p>Transferring these tokens, like other Binance Smart Chain tokens, require BNB to fulfill the transaction costs. Therefore, it is necessary to keep a small amount of BNB in your wallet while making such transactions. </p>
<p>BEP-721 tokens can be generated on the Juggerworld platforms, Featured By Binance, BakerySwap, and Binance NFT Marketplace, among others in the BSC ecosystem.</p>
<p>Such tokens can represent the following:</p>
<p>These tokens contain a set of operations that control how they communicate with the Binance Smart Chain. Some of them are quite common and may be found in the BEP-20 standard:</p>
<p>A collection of fundamental ownership functions is also available, some of which are optional to add. The metadata functionality is a unique characteristic of NFTs:</p>
<p>Let's take an example of CryptoPunk, where each unit includes information in the NFT that links to a specific punk in a grid of 10,000 punks. Despite the fact that CryptoPunks do not follow the BEP-721 token standard, they do use metadata.</p>

<title>BEP-95 (Bruno Hard Fork Upgrade)</title>

<preview>Binance Evolution Protocol (BEP-95) is a Bruno hard fork upgrade that aims to speed up the BNB token burning process.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is BEP-95 (Bruno Hard Fork Upgrade)?</h2>
<div>Binance Evolution Proposal (BEP-95) offers a real-time burning mechanism to Binance Smart Chain, the Binance-backed decentralized blockchain protocol. The network revealed on October 22 that the new BEP-95 protocol will include a real-time coin-burning process. The concept, according to BSC developers, would benefit both validators and holders in the form of a higher value of tokens as the price will keep on increasing over time. </div>
<div>After Ethereum, BSC is the second most popular crypto network to use this strategy to inflate its native token’s price. It was included to make BNB's tokenomics even more dynamic.</div>
<div>BEP-95 is similar to Ethereum's EIP-1559 protocol, which was implemented earlier in August. Thus, like the 'London Hard Fork,' the Bruno update aims to reduce the amount of BNB in circulation over time.</div>
<p>Binance intends to improve the network's decentralization (over 60%) by speeding up the full node sync. Furthermore, because it is a burning process for BNB, the coin's price is expected to experience huge gains. </p>
<h2>Gas Fee Distribution in BEP-95</h2>
<div>BNB is a deflationary token, therefore, there is no mining algorithm in place allowing new tokens to be mined and rewarded to validators. Moreover, the supply will continue to decrease in accordance with Binance's planned BNB burns. </div>
<p>BNB is a native token of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange with a wide range of applications, and delegators and validators will continue to benefit from their BNB holdings.</p>
<div>From each block, the gas cost is collected and distributed between two system smart contracts, named System Reward Contract and ValidatorSet Contract.</div>
<p>The new protocol will help the network in the following ways: </p>
<p>The BEP-95 burn is entirely reliant on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network's operation, and it will continue to reduce BNB supply even after the scheduled BNB burning events achieve the target supply of 100 million tokens. </p>
<p>It will accelerate the process of burning the tokens. </p>
<p>Because a portion of the gas costs will be burned, BEP-95 protocol will make BSC more decentralized. </p>
<p>It will result in an increase in BNB’s value.</p>

<title>Beta (Release)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/beta-release</url>
<file>beta-release.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A software pre-release stage where its access is offered to a set number of users &amp; third-party software testers for testing it under real-world settings.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Beta (Release)?</h2>
<div>The word beta is used in computer science to describe the second stage of a software development cycle, following the alpha stage. During this phase, the key functional requirements of the application software are operational and tests are done for effectiveness, accessibility, and security. Typically, the beta stage allows testers, who are not part of the development team or organization, access to the application to find and report bugs (if any). This allows for an unbiased review where the bugs that are identified get fixed within time. </div>
<div>User acceptance testing is a process that is carried out during the beta stage by actual users of the application in a real environment. It is the final check before a product is released to the customers. A significant benefit of this stage is the direct input from clients. </div>
<div>The software is made accessible to developers and potential consumers in order to conduct these evaluations. This is known as a beta release, and the people who participate in it are known as beta testers.</div>
<div>Beta versions go through internal alpha testing and are typically close to the final product in terms of appearance, feel, and functionality. This is why design modifications are common between the two versions.</div>
<div>Closed (or private) beta testing, as the name implies, includes a smaller number of testers. This method may be appropriate for testing software that needs input from a specific demographic or can't be tested on a larger scale owing to scaling constraints. Open beta testing, on the other hand, typically involves a large number of users, many of whom are potential customers. In this case, it may be viewed as a marketing technique aimed at demonstrating the product to the target audience.</div>
<p>When creating software, beta testing is necessary since developers are too connected to their developed software, and fresh eyes are needed to identify issues. There are no specific guidelines for how to set up this evaluation process or what it should entail, however, the procedure must be linked to a strict set of goals. There are a few conditions that a product must meet in order to be eligible for beta testing: </p>
<p>A small number of end-users are given the beta version of the software in order to get input on the product's quality. It lowers the chances of a product failure and improves its quality by allowing customers to validate it.</p>
<p>Beta testers, particularly volunteers, are generally motivated by a desire to learn more about a new product. This phase is usually focused on the usability, with testers reporting issues and providing comments. They may also suggest additional features and functions, but this is more frequent at the early stage.</p>
<p>As a result, the beta stage allows developers to make changes and address issues before moving on to the next step (release). When beta software is nearing completion, it is referred to as a &quot;release candidate.&quot; If no further issues or defects occur, the application can be released as a &quot;stable release.&quot;</p>
<div>The same procedure goes for any new cryptocurrency that is scheduled to be released into the market. Before it is enlisted on major exchanges, it is thoroughly tested by software developers both internally and externally. This process ensures that the cryptocurrency’s blockchain architecture does not collapse when an influx of users start trading it.</div>

<title>Bid Price</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bid-price</url>
<file>bid-price.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The cost that someone is willing to pay for a security, asset, commodity, service, or contract is referred to as a bid price.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Bid Price?</h2>
<div>The highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for a certain product or service is known as the bid price. It is the amount of money that buyers offer for an item, such as a commodity, security, or cryptocurrency, in the context of financial marketplaces.</div>
<div>Brokers or shareholders who want to sell their assets or stock holdings must either choose one of the existing bid prices on the order book (preferably the highest) or submit an ask price and wait for a buyer to bid against it, thus fulfilling the order.</div>
<div>Traders in financial markets have the ability to select what price they are prepared to pay to purchase or sell an asset at the time they place their order. Obviously, if their pricing is too far off from the current market price, their order will not be completed.</div>
<p>A bid is usually lower than the offered price, also known as the &quot;ask price’’, which is the price at which people are ready to sell. The bid-ask spread is calculated by subtracting the two values.</p>
<div>A trade order book has various bid prices on the buyer's side and ask prices on the seller's side. The highest bid price is always less than the minimum ask price, and the disparity is known as the bid-ask spread.</div>
<p>Market makers create bids for a security on a regular basis, and they may also create bids when a seller seeks a price at which they may sell. The spread reflects the difference between these two prices/values. Market makers (MMs) gain money from the spread. As a result, the wider the spread, the more revenue an investor generates.</p>
<div>When a bidder submits an offer even though the seller is not actively trying to sell, it is referred to as an unsolicited bid.</div>
<p>Bid prices are frequently set in order to elicit the desired response from the party submitting the bid. For example, if a buyer wants to pay $30 for an item and the asking price is $40, they can make a $20 offer and pretend to surrender by offering to meet halfway—exactly where they intended to be in the first place.</p>
<div>A bidding war occurs when many bidders compete for the same item and place bids one after the other. When a bidding war starts, buyers keep on placing higher bids in order to defeat the bids of competing buyers, causing the price for that item to rapidly rise.</div>
<p>For example, a company may establish a $10,000 asking price for a product. Bidder A may place a $7,000 bid. Bidder B may put up $8,500. Bidder A may reply with a bid of $9,000 and so on and so forth.</p>
<div>The cryptocurrency trading market, like other financial markets such as stocks, forex, futures, and options, can be quite competitive. However, when it comes to trading and real-time price updates when markets open, they all take identical steps.</div>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are mostly sold at a lower than the ask price, but they are never higher. The buyer has complete control over the bid price, except when it is significantly out of line with market standards and requires a price adjustment.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Bid-Ask Spread?</h2>
<div>A bid-ask spread is a difference between the highest price which a buyer is willing to pay for an asset as well as the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for an asset. The spread is the transaction cost, where price takers can buy at the asking price and sell at the bid price; however, the market maker buys at the bid price and sells at the asking price. The bid actually represents demand, while the ask represents the supply for an asset. The bid-ask spread is the measurement of market liquidity.</div>
<p>Going even further, the bid-ask spread is dependent on the liquidity, which means the more liquid a stock is, the tighter the spread it has. When an order is placed, the buyer or seller has an obligation to purchase or even sell their shares at the agreed price, and different types of orders can trigger different order placements. </p>
<p>Bid-ask spread can be high due to a multitude of factors. One of the key factors that play a role is liquidity, and when there is a significant amount of liquidity within a market for security, the spread is tighter as a result of this. Stocks that are traded heavily have a smaller bid-ask spread. A bid-ask spread can be larger for unknown or unpopular securities within a specific day. </p>
<p>In other words, for the bid-ask spread to be a success, the traders have to be willing to take a stand as well as walk away in the bid-ask process through limit orders.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The four or five biggest technological corporations, particularly Facebook, Apple, Google, and Amazon, are referred to as &quot;Big Tech&quot; as they enjoy the biggest shares in their respective indus</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Big Tech?</h2>
<div>Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google are among the five largest firms in the information technology (IT) industry in the United States and are known as the Big Tech. Microsoft is occasionally added to this list when it fulfills certain criteria of market cap, profits, revenues, employee count, or desirability as an employer.</div>
<div>Big Tech businesses have become some of the most lucrative publicly listed companies in the world, with market capitalizations ranging from $500 billion to $2 trillion. They operate in several sectors and have a strong effect on consumers across multiple platforms. Each of the major technology firms serves as a hub for high-tech internet services and activities.</div>
<p>These top IT corporations enjoy a monopoly in their respective fields. For example, Amazon is the e-commerce giant, Facebook is the leading social media platform in the world, Google is the search engine chief, and Apple is the communication hardware chairman. These digital behemoths wield such power in their areas owing to their in-depth understanding of market demands and their ability to provide products that meet those needs while ensuring consumer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Big Tech giants also know how to break into new and emerging markets. Facebook bolstered its social networking position by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. While Amazon dominates both e-commerce and streaming services. Moreover, its acquisition of Whole Foods has significantly boosted its physical presence. Google isn't only about search engines; they also provide email, video sharing, and other services to users.</p>
<p>These leading IT companies of the world have radically altered how people use technology, establishing a digital ecosystem that relies on these businesses' services on a daily basis for millions of individuals. As a result, questions and concerns about these businesses' ever-increasing degree of power often arise. While some argue that these firms are promoting social change, others point to their commercial dominance and express concerns about a tech monopoly.</p>
<p>Since Big Tech has so much power and has such an impact throughout the world, concerns have also been voiced that its authoritarian business methods are excessively concentrated and focused on disproportionate profit, mass monitoring, inadequate security and privacy, obnoxious advertising, and rampant data theft. Their development, on the other hand, is unstoppable, with free internet services, improved smartphone capability, and widely accessible e-commerce.</p>
<p>Since they provide consumers cheaper services than ever before, several of the big digital corporations have been able to dodge any significant competition inquiries. Monopolistic practices, on the other hand, are increasingly being investigated.</p>
<p>Their ability to pay what looked to be excessive fees for quickly developing competitors has been one topic of attention. According to emails obtained by the US Congress, Mark Zuckerberg suggested that Facebook acquire Instagram in order to counteract the threat it poses. Facebook has started to merge Instagram's messaging capabilities with its other social network, Whatsapp, in breach of previous assurances.</p>
<p>In the United States, Google is under severe antitrust scrutiny for its dominance in internet search, which the EU determined it had exploited by enhancing results for its own operations in 2017.</p>
<p>Companies attempting to offer services to iPhone consumers are becoming hostile to Apple. Epic Games, the founder of the massively popular Fortnite video game franchise, and Spotify, the music streaming platform, have both submitted legal objections against Apple's assertion on taking a 30% cut of all app store sales, including music streaming subscriptions, which Spotify and many other third-party app developers have long complained is an unreasonable &quot;tax.&quot;</p>
<div>However, blockchain is a big fighting chance for companies who want to end the monopoly of Big Tech.</div>
<p>Many tech companies are currently developing methods to leverage blockchains and related technologies to establish social media networks, store online information, and host websites without the need for a central authority. It will be far more difficult for any government or corporation to block accounts or remove content if this is implemented.</p>
<div>After the big tech companies have exerted their leverage in ways that raised worries about their authority, these experiments have resurfaced. Tech companies are investing in cryptocurrencies simply because they are based on a simple internet technology that is independent of any single person or entity's control or influence. This is what the internet aspires to be, and it will become more so over time.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Binary code is a two-symbol system that is based on numbers, &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1,&quot; to represent text, computer processor commands, or any other type of data.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Binary Code?</h2>
<div>Binary code is the most basic form of programming data that a computer can directly comprehend. It is made up of a series of 0s and 1s that is organized and structured so that it can be received and processed as part of a bigger computer application. It is the result of a multiphase composition process that converts source code written in a high-level language like C or Java into machine code tailored to the processor architecture on which the computer application runs. In some ways, it can be termed as the computer's core language, converted from human-readable source code.</div>
<div>A binary code transmission is a sequence of electrical pulses that depict numbers, characters, and actions. Elements such as transistors flip on (1) or off (0) to transmit or stop the pulses, while a machine called a clock sends out regular pulses. Each decimal number (0–9) is represented by a group of four binary digits, or bits, in binary code. The four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are all reducible to binary number combinations, also called fundamental Boolean algebra operations.</div>
<div>Binary code has a simple working process. It assigns a sequence of binary digits, or bits, to each character or pedagogical format, such as an eight-bit binary string that may represent any of the 256 possible values to indicate a wide range of objects. Binary codes are most commonly used to convert data from one format to another, e.g. conversion of character strings to bit strings.</div>
<div>Machine code is made up of sets of binary digits that are combined to generate instructions. Binary represents a small quantity of data that passes through all the sophisticated hardware and software systems that handle today's data resources and assets, in addition to being the most fundamental form of code. A bit is the smallest unit of data and is expressed by either a one or a zero. Continuous strings of these bits create the code or data that a computer decodes.</div>
<p>Binary code and binary data are fascinating aspects of the foundational world of IT. It is most apparent to people who operate behind the scenes to develop today's user-oriented technologies, which frequently hide all types of computer code from users.</p>
<div>A blockchain is a distributed ledger system that is used to store data. It resides on a digital database and can take the shape of a string of binary &quot;bits,&quot; or ones and zeros, that can be analyzed by computers and converted into human-readable text. It can be said that binary code is the foundational element of blockchain and all the cryptocurrencies it supports.</div>

<preview>A bit is a basic unit of information in computing.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bit?</h2>
<p>A bit is essentially a basic unit of information in the case of computing. The name is a contraction of the binary digit and represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These two values are only 0 and 1. Bits are typically grouped up into bit multiples that are called bytes in order to store data as well as execute specific instructions. A group of eight bits is typically defined as a byte, where four bits are known as a nibble.</p>
<p>Now, due to the fact that bits are small, you will rarely work with information one bit at a time, and they are typically assembled into a group of eight. Once a bit is grouped up into eight bits, this becomes a byte. A byte contains enough information to store one ASCII character. </p>
<p>A kilobyte, on the other hand is 1.024 bytes due to the fact that computers use binary math, instead of decimal math, meaning that they are categorized this way.</p>
<p>Computer storage in fact, as well as memory, is measured in megabytes as well as gigabytes.</p>
<p>Many hard drive manufacturers will use decimal number systems in order to define amounts of storage space, and 1 MB, as a result, is defined as one million bytes, while 1 GB is defined as one billion bytes. Since a computer uses a binary system, it can be different.</p>

<preview>An automated teller machine (ATM or cashpoint) that allows the user to buy and sell Bitcoin.</preview>
<description>
<p>Bitcoin ATMs work in a similar fashion to conventional cash machines — but instead of being shown their bank account details, users are presented with a series of options for trading Bitcoin in exchange for cash. </p>
<div>BATMs that only offer buying options are referred to as unidirectional, while those that offer both buy and sell functionality are known as bidirectional.Behind the scenes, BATMs are distinct from conventional ATMs. Most importantly, they do not connect to a user's bank or to a banking network. Instead, they are essentially internet-enabled interfaces that allow the user to interact with a specific exchange.It is generally thought that the first Bitcoin ATM was opened in 2013, at a coffee shop in the Canadian city of Vancouver. As of 2020, there are reported to be as many as 2,500 BATMs in the U.S. alone. They are most frequently found in transport hubs such as airports and rail stations, as well as in specialist shops and cafes.In order to install a BATM in a business premises, the owner will enter into a contract with a BATM provider who manufactures and, where applicable, installs the device on-site. There is a growing range of BATM providers, and most of the world is now fairly well served. Some providers offer both unidirectional and bidirectional hardware, while others offer additional services such as voucher and customer retention schemes.Although Bitcoin ATMs are growing in popularity, they have been criticized for imposing high transaction fees on users. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published an official warning to consumers regarding fees and exchange rates. Meanwhile other jurisdictions including Canada and the U.K. have targeted Bitcoin ATM operators in tax investigations.</div>

<preview>Bitcoin Dominance is a metric that determines how much share of the overall crypto market share is owned by Bitcoin.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Bitcoin Dominance (BTCD)?</h2>
<div>Bitcoin dominance (BTCD) is defined as the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to that of the rest of the cryptocurrency markets.</div>
<div>Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency that was first introduced back in 2009. It is based on principles (in a whitepaper) given by Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown and untraceable individual (or probably a group of people), who is (are) regarded as the creator(s) of Bitcoin. Bitcoin provides lower transaction costs than most online payment methods, and as opposed to government-regulated fiat currencies, it relies on the concept of decentralization.</div>
<div>By market capitalization, bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, accounting for a substantial percentage of the trading activity in cryptocurrency exchanges. While bitcoin was by far the most popular cryptocurrency for many years (still is), its dominance was considerably closer to 100% five years ago than it is now. With the addition of new currencies, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin’s overall dominance has started to crumble. </div>
<div>In 2013, Bitcoin had only a few competitors. It had a 94% market share at the time. Back then, ERC-20 tokens and stablecoins did not even exist, Ethereum was only a dream of Vitalik Buterin's vision.</div>
<div>All of that changed in 2017, with the altcoin boom. By February 2017, BTC's market domination reduced to 85.4%, ETH had a 5.7% share of the cryptocurrency market, while Ripple's XRP enjoyed 1.1% of the share.</div>
<div>From there on, it was only a matter of time as bitcoin's market share plummeted as a flurry of initial coin offers (ICOs) raised the industry's market value significantly. As of now, the BTCD is 45.23% at the time of writing, and it continues to go down, as new coins and tokens make their debut in the cryptocurrency markets. </div>
<div>However, no other coin has ever come close to the popularity of bitcoin. This is why when the price of bitcoin plummets, so do the other altcoins in the market and vice versa. </div>
<div>This effect of bitcoin has increased its acceptance as a payment method in most parts of the world. The transactions are processed with a hardware terminal or wallet address using QR codes. An online business can easily add bitcoin to its existing payment methods, such as credit cards, PayPal, and so on.</div>
<div>Regardless of the fact that each bitcoin transaction is recorded in a public network, the identities (names) of the buyers and sellers are never revealed; only their wallet addresses are accessible to the public. While this keeps Bitcoin users' transactions anonymous, it also allows them to purchase and sell anything without being identified. As a result, it has become the preferred method of payment for those purchasing narcotics or other illegal goods on the internet. This practice has brought criticism of Bitcoin from regulatory authorities, however, the popularity of bitcoin only continues to rise.</div>

<title>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip</url>
<file>bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The standard format for documents proposing changes to Bitcoin.</preview>
<description>
<p>Bitcoin has no hierarchical or defined organisational structure. As a result, a generally agreed-upon standard for the introduction of new ideas to Bitcoin was required. </p>
<p>The first BIP was issued in 2011, setting out the format of the BIP itself, and taking inspiration from the system of proposals for changes to the Python language. Every BIP is publicly available on GitHub.Bitcoin Improvement Proposals normally fall into one of three categories: Standards Track, Informational, and Process. </p>
<div>Standards Track BIPs relate to changes to the protocol or validation methods. Informational BIPs are for educational purposes, or for raising awareness. Process BIPs relate to proposed process changes outside the Bitcoin protocol.Informational BIPs can be accepted or ignored by the Bitcoin community as it wishes. Standards Track and Process BIPs, however, require community consensus and must be considered. Before reaching this stage, BIPs go through a drafting or “triaging” process — beginning with a draft which is either proposed, rejected, withdrawn or deferred. The active stage comes next, followed by obsolescence or replacement. Most BIPs begin life through discussions on listservs or other communities.BIPs might relate to critical decisions such as hard and soft forks. For example, BIP 141, also known as SegWit, proposed a soft fork intended to increase network capacity. Fork proposals require a 95% majority among miners.Crucially, BIPs cannot be enforced. Even if community consensus is reached on a change laid out in a BIP, each developer makes their own choice regarding which codebase they use. Further, there is no way or desire to dictate which version of the code is used by individual Bitcoin users. Many changes — such as modifications to the user interface — require no BIP at all.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) is used by investors as an investment tool that ranges from 0 to 100.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI)?</h2>
<div>Created in 2018 by Wallstreet trader, Tom Lee, the BMI uses Bitcoin’s price action to derive a value ranging between 0-100 which is then interpreted by traders as a buy or sell signal. A value below 27 is regarded as the “misery” stage, which is a strong buy signal and a value over 67 is known as the “happy” stage which is the point where Bitcoin is likely to fall. The index is calculated by using the volatility and the number of winning trades out of the total trades.</div>
<p>It is a contrarian index which is informally known as “Fear Indexes”. These indexes measure volatility, which is then used to calculate a numeric value to assess the overall sentiment of the markets. The Bitcoin Misery Index is similar to the VIX, which tracks the prices of financial options to measure volatility.</p>
<p>Source: Fundstrat</p>
<p>Here is a chart showing the signals of the Bitcoin Misery Index for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>It can be seen that whenever a great buy signal was seen, a sharp rally was observed soon after. The opposite can be seen when the index touched values over 67 and a reversal was seen shortly after. This is exactly what happened in December 2013 when the Bitcoin Misery Index touched 100.</p>

<title>Bitcoin NFTs</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) minted on Bitcoin-powered blockchains and secured by the Bitcoin network are known as Bitcoin NFTs</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Bitcoin NFTs?</h2>
<div>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were first introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain ahead of operational smart contract functionality on the network. Indeed, before anyone knew what an &quot;NFT&quot; was, digital collectibles (mostly cards) were tokenized and shared over Counterparty, a protocol built on Bitcoin that records Bitcoin data. This initial effort kicked off in 2016 when the “Rare Pepes” digital collectible cards were first popularized on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, due to Bitcoin’s limitations and Ethereum’s growing popularity, the project migrated to Ethereum and other chains.</div>
<p>Even though the concept of NFTs first found its way into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the legacy network has remained mostly disconnected from the flourishing NFT projects, platforms and marketplaces. The reason? It is nearly impossible to deploy smart contracts on Bitcoin’s core protocol. </p>
<div>Bitcoin evolved with the Taproot upgrade that added new features and functionalities to the network. However, it still didn’t allow developers to deploy complex smart contracts on the main Bitcoin chain. Stacks claims to solve this by offering fully expressive smart contracts functionality while settling all transactions to the Bitcoin block.</div>
<div>Just as developers can use Stacks’ infrastructure to enable Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or decentralized applications (Dapps) without wrapping BTC to use on other chains like Ethereum, the platform’s smart contract functionality can also be used to mint NFTs backed by Bitcoin blockchain’s security and liquidity. Since most of the work happens on the Stacks chain, NFT transactions become faster, cheaper and energy-efficient without compromising the security of final settlement on the Bitcoin network.</div>
<div>Based on this, we can say that Bitcoin NFTs are NFTs that are minted on Bitcoin-powered chains. Some Bitcoin NFT platforms are Gamma, Byzantion, and HeyLayer, and Light Night. </div>
<p>Author Bio</p>
<p>Muneeb Ali is the CEO of Trust Machines, a startup that recently raised $150M to build the largest ecosystem of Bitcoin applications. He is the co-founder of Stacks, a decentralized programming layer for Bitcoin. Muneeb received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University. His Ph.D. thesis was nominated for the ACM SIGCOMM dissertation award by Princeton University. Muneeb gives guest lectures on Bitcoin &amp; crypto at Princeton and his research publications have over 1,500 citations. He is one of the main characters in George Gilder's book Life After Google and was a technical advisor to the HBO show Silicon Valley.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Pizza</title>

<file>bitcoin-pizza.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Bitcoin Pizza refers to the infamous transaction where a guy, named Laszlo Hanyecz, paid 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas making it the first business transaction of Bitcoin in the real world.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Bitcoin Pizza?</h2>
<div>A historic Bitcoin transaction was done on May 22, 2010, in which a man from Florida used the cryptocurrency to pay for two pizzas. The day is celebrated every year, not because of the transaction, but because of the price: the individual in question, Laszlo Hanyecz, paid 10,000 BTC for the two pizzas, which is now worth about USD $465,352,000 with one bitcoin valued at $46,490, at the time of writing.</div>
<p>Laszlo Hanyecz is also the first individual to make a business transaction with Bitcoin where he bought two Papa John's pizzas on May 22, 2010. Hanyeczs' pizzas have become increasingly expensive since then as they were valued at $10,000 just nine months after the transaction when Bitcoin achieved equivalence with the US dollar, and the rest is history.</p>
<div>Interestingly, Hanyecz does not regret his decision. In an interview, he said that "Bitcoin is a way to harness greed." He went on to say that: “It’s common knowledge that anybody who held for four years is in the money. But businesses can’t generally afford to just hold on for four years and not pay their rent.” “It was a really interesting system but nobody’s using it,” he said. “If nobody’s using it, it doesn’t matter if I have it all.”</div>
<div>The irony of this historic transaction was such that the person who bought this pizza from Hanyecz also sold his Bitcoins for a negligible price. Sturdivant, who was 19 at the time, sent two pizzas to Hanyecz and got 10k bitcoins in return. However, not knowing the immense potential of this cryptocurrency, he spent them all to cover the expenses of his business trip. He went on record to have said: “If I had treated it as an investment, I might have held on a bit longer.” He also said: &quot;I would never have thought that the same number of Bitcoins would have a purchasing power on the order of real estate.&quot;</div>
<div>This act of both individuals, Hanyecz and Sturdivant, would seem foolish right now, however, at that time no one really knew the immense value this digital currency will have in the years to come.</div>
<p>Since this interesting transaction, crypto enthusiasts celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22 all over the world. </p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Bitcointalk is the most popular online forum dedicated to Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Bitcointalk?</h2>
<div>Today, Bitcointalk is one of the largest online forums where people can ask questions and discuss topics related to Bitcoin, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in general. The forum was created by the infamous inventor of Bitcoin itself — Satoshi Nakamoto, in November 2009.</div>
<p>Like most online forums, Bitcointalk allows users to create a profile and start posting to different threads and subthreads inside the forum. The forum’s main purpose is to create a community of people interested in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Forum users can post questions and discussion topics, which are then debated at length by other community members.</p>
<div>There are thousands of different threads available on Bitcointalk, and they cover a wide variety of topics. You can find information about how Bitcoin works, how the blockchain behind the cryptocurrency operates, and how to get started with mining Bitcoin. </div>
<p>The story behind Bitcointalk is almost as mysterious as the one behind Bitcoin itself. Initially, Satoshi Nakamoto was using a SourceForge forum to post about Bitcoin and discuss the technology. However, this forum is now lost. In order to provide a space for such discussions to continue thriving, user Sirius provided hosting for a new forum where Satoshi could continue posting. However, as Nakamoto gradually withdrew from the public space, Sirius decided to move the forum to its present address and announce it is a strictly unofficial Bitcoin discussion forum. </p>
<p>Despite the mysterious beginning, Bitcointalk users now comprise the largest Bitcoin and cryptocurrency online community. The forum has expanded beyond simply discussing Bitcoin, and there are now threads covering some of the major altcoins and stablecoins available on the market. One of the reasons why Bitcointalk became so big is the diversity of languages supported on the forum. Anyone can start a thread in any language, which has attracted users from all over the world. Another great feature of Bitcointalk is the ability to easily search through the whole database of topics and discussion entries. The search feature allows users to find the information they are looking for easily, and if it is not available, they can swiftly create a new thread where other users can discuss.</p>
<div>Bitcointalk is one of the most important resources for people interested in learning more about crypto, consensus mechanisms, mining and blockchain technology. As one of the oldest forums for crypto talk, it has the richest library of topics and discussions. </div>

<title>BitLicense</title>

<file>bitlicense.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A business license permitting regulated virtual currency activities, issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services.</preview>
<description>
<div>Coming into effect in August 2015, the BitLicense was the first regulatory regime targeted at cryptocurrency businesses in the U.S.</div>
<div>It regulates a broad range of crypto activities — including the transmission of cryptocurrency, the provision of exchange services, and the issuance of digital assets. </div>
<p>A BitLicense is required by any resident of New York carrying out regulated cryptocurrency activities, or any non-resident person or other entity that is engaged in those activities with people who do live in New York. Crucially, though, individuals who are making or receiving crypto payments are exempt.BitLicense was extremely controversial upon launch, and remains the subject of widespread ire within the crypto community. </p>
<p>Many crypto businesses insist that the regime places unfairly onerous restrictions and obligations on them — and that the cost of applying for the BitLicense (estimated to run to at least $100,000) is punitive. </p>
<p>When the regulations came into force in 2015, at least 10 crypto-related businesses announced that they would cease all trading activities in New York as a result. Indeed, only a handful of companies have successfully received BitLicenses since its launch.Regardless of industry reception, the BitLicense is a key part of a more general effort on the part of global lawmakers to regulate crypto — a sector that is resistant to state interference by nature. </p>
<div>However, as recent events show — such as the backlash that Facebook’s Libra project received from central banks — tighter oversight of cryptocurrencies and decentralized technology more generally seems inevitable.</div>

<title>Bits</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bits</url>
<file>bits.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A commonly used unit, or subdivision, of a single Bitcoin.</preview>
<description>
<div>Bitcoin, like any currency, must have the capacity to be subdivided. This is especially important for the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency as a unit of exchange rather than pure speculation. Subdivision also became increasingly vital when Bitcoin's price rose so dramatically.There is a long list of broadly agreed classifications of Bitcoin sub-units. Bitcoin has a metric system, and is divisible to eight decimal points. A deci-bitcoin (written as dBTC) is 0.1 of a coin. Centi-bitcoin (cBTC) is 0.01 — while the smallest unit of value, 0.00000001, is known as a Satoshi.The use of bit as the standard subdivision grew out of a proposal originally published on the Bitcoin subreddit, suggesting that each coin be divided into one million units. These are referred to as bits.The bit as a subdivision has several key advantages. Most standard financial software is only able to parse two decimal places, a key issue for the interoperability of Bitcoin. Bits can be expressed to two decimal places, for example 99.99 bits, making bookkeeping and accounting with bits possible.</div>
<div>Similarly, the simplicity of bits will, it is hoped, mean that it remains an easily understandable expression of value even if Bitcoin prices rise very significantly, in part because it is in line with the subdivision format of most global currencies.Agreement on subdivisions is seen as an important element of Bitcoin's route to mass adoption. If it is to become a widely used method of payment for real world goods and services, it needs to be easily understood by average consumers.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Configuration data loaded onto an FPGA is called Bitstream.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Bitstream?</h2>
<div>Typically, a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) has a file containing a set of instructions or a program which is called FPGA Bitstream as it contains a stream of bits. </div>
<h2>FPGA Bitstream</h2>
<p>FPGA bitstream file is used to configure the pinout and set up the internal logic modules. It is generated by HDL (Hardware Description Language) and you can use the FPGA tool to configure it.</p>
<p>In the context of FPGA, Bitstream is a circuit design in digital logic for configuring the device. As per the name, it can be seen as a stream of bits that describe the function of the design.</p>
<p>FPGA stands for field-programmable gate array which is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing. This means after the manufacturing of an integrated circuit, its configuration can be changed by the customer according to their requirement. The configuration can be done by software or hardware means. If we use software means then it will take considerable time to configure but if we use hardware means, then it will take lesser time but will consume a considerable amount of power and programming effort which is not feasible for large projects. That's why in most cases, the hardware configuration is used for FPGAs.</p>
<p>To program an FPGA device, we need a file in Verilog or VHDL language which describes how the particular integrated circuit should behave.</p>
<p>The full bitstream is the program that runs on the FPGA. It controls all of the I/O pins and has a bunch of RAM and flash memory attached to it. The partial bitstream is the program that runs on the FPGA and is only responsible for implementing part of the design.</p>
<p>Partial bitstream implementation of an FPGA is a time-saving strategy since it avoids the implementation of unused portions of the design. It is also known as partial reconfiguration or partial compilation. It can either be written using the parallel interface on the target device or using a host computer.</p>

<title>Black Hat Hacker</title>

<preview>Black hat hackers usually use malware to penetrate into computerized networks and systems to steal data.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Black Hat Hacker?</h2>
<div>Black hat hackers usually use malware to penetrate into computerized networks and systems to steal data in most cases. Their actions are primarily driven by personal or financial gain. They can range from inexperienced to highly skilled individuals with the goal of spreading malware and stealing sensitive information, such as login passwords, as well as financial and personal data. Black hat hackers can steal, modify, or delete system data after gaining access to their targets, depending on their motivations.</div>
<h2>Types of Hacking </h2>
<p>Hacking can take several forms, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the subject. Furthermore, the majority of them use various drivers.</p>
<p>Some hackers steal money, while others gain access to classified information from the government and assist in spying on a party. Furthermore, some are created solely to allow crooks to demonstrate their hacking abilities. We have also seen politically-driven hacktivist organizations, such as Anonymous and WikiLeaks, form in recent decades.</p>
<h2>What Are the Types of Hacking?</h2>
<div>Let's start with keylogging, which is one of the most popular methods of spying on a computer user. A keylogger is a piece of software that secretly captures what you type on your keyboard. Everything the application records is saved in a log file, allowing hackers to see your personal information, such as passwords and IDs.</div>
<div>You probably already know how to fish: you put the hook onto a fishing rod and throw it into the water. Phishers perform the same thing in a phishing attack, however instead of a hook, they utilize a bogus website and deliver it to you by email. Similar to keyloggers, they also want to steal your personal data. </div>
<div>The list of hacking methods is incomplete without the brute force attack. It is a technique that uses a computation algorithm to test all potential password combinations. The procedure might take millions of years to complete, depending on how strong the password is.</div>
<div>Imagine having to pay to access your own files. That is the whole point of ransomware hacks. Hackers encrypt your files with ransomware and then demand a ransom to unlock your data. They'll tell you how to pay for the decryption key so you can get your data back.</div>
<p>This hacking approach aims to bring entire websites down and prohibit their owners from providing their services. Previously, the term &quot;denial-of-service&quot; or &quot;DoS&quot; was used to describe this type of attack. </p>
<div>Large corporations are the common targets of DDoS attacks or distributed denial-of-service attacks. These are coordinated attacks against many sites, with the ability to bring all of their online assets to a halt.</div>
<h2>Difference Between White Hat Hackers and Black Hat Hackers</h2>
<p>Let's speak about the good folks, or white hats, now that you know what a black hat hacker is. While they are similar in some ways, their motivations are not the same.</p>
<p>The terms white hat and black hat are used to describe a hacker's motivations and methods. They are derived from the spaghetti westerns (from the 1950s and 1960s). Good characters wore white hats whereas evil ones wore black hats in classic western films. As a result, the phrases ethical and criminal hackers are frequently used interchangeably.</p>
<p>A black hat hacker, on the other hand, is more accurately depicted in the media. Hackers are those who breach systems, steal data, modify data, and jeopardize security. When it comes to reasons, people usually do it for monetary gain, political gain, or just for fun. Their attacks might range from basic malware dissemination to data theft.</p>
<p>An &quot;ethical hacker&quot; is a term used to describe a white hat hacker. These are hackers who are frequently hired by governments to secure sensitive data from black hat hackers. A penetration tester, for instance, is a relatively frequent white-hat hacker job. A penetration tester is a person who is hired to get into someone's system in order to find faults in it. These tests can assist a corporation to improve its system security. They also aid in the prevention of online fraud.</p>

<title>Black Swan Event</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/black-swan-event</url>
<file>black-swan-event.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A black swan event, also known as black swan occurrences, is a metaphor for an unexpected event that has a significant impact.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Black Swan Event?</h2>
<div>A black swan is an event that is characterized by its extreme rarity and severe impact. The term was first coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a writer who is also a finance professor and former Wall Street trader. </div>
<div>In his 2007 book, Taleb talks about the idea of a black swan event: an event that is impossible to predict but has catastrophic consequences. According to him, these events are extremely rare and unpredictable, which is why it is important for people to always expect their possibilities and plan accordingly.</div>
<p>A black swan, according to Taleb, is an event that is so uncommon that even the probability of its occurrence is unknown. There are three major components of the incident:</p>
<p>The Black Swan Theory, also known as the Theory of Black Swan Events, can be linked directly to a Latin phrase used by the Roman poet Juvenal in the 2nd century, when he characterized something as a &quot;black swan event&quot; as “in terris nigroque simillima cygno rara avis”</p>
<div>This Latin phrase means &quot;an unusual bird in the lands that looks a lot like a black swan.&quot; It was formerly assumed that black swans did not exist when this proverb was coined.</div>
<div>A black swan occurrence in the financial (&amp; cryptocurrency) markets is very unfavorable, resulting in broad devastation and famously unpredictable consequences.</div>
<div>The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, which was caused by the unexpected, catastrophic fall of what had formerly been a flourishing property market, is the most famous example of a black swan occurrence in the world of finance.</div>
<p>Lenders in the United States had drastically loosened their requirements for eligibility for mortgages, mostly as a consequence of the federal government's pressure. People with bad or no credit were accepted for mortgages on properties that were, to put it bluntly, well above their financial means.</p>
<p>Subprime mortgages soon grew into a large, bloated bubble that was about to explode. Lending behemoths, like Lehman Brothers, began to crumble and fail as payment dates passed and mortgages began to default in droves.</p>
<div>The US government was compelled to authorize the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) — a roughly $1 trillion program aimed at bailing out big banks and restoring liquidity in the economy. To avoid a repeat of the 2008 crisis, governments throughout the globe tightened laws for financial institutions, making it more difficult for them to take on certain types of (and amounts of) debt.</div>
<p>At present, the world is experiencing and recovering from one of the most spectacular examples of a black swan occurrence. The new coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, satisfies all of Taleb's requirements for this event. The pandemic struck without warning, and it rapidly became clear that no country was equipped to cope with it. Every day, we learned (still learning) a bit more about the worldwide pandemic's devastating impacts, which include record-breaking unemployment rates, stock market crashes, ever-increasing death tolls, and so on.</p>
<p>No one knows when a black swan event occurs, just as many people can’t predict seeing a black swan amongst a flock of white ones.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Blake-256?</h2>
<p>Used in Decred, Blake-256 is a hash algorithm designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Luca Henzen, Willi Meier and Raphael C.-W. Phan. It was developed to run at least as fast as MD5 on 32-bit processors and at least as fast as SHA-1 on 64-bit processors.</p>
<p>Blake is based on ChaCha, a variant of the Salsa20 stream cipher, but its internal state is larger than that of Salsa20 (1600 bits vs. 256 bits). The message is first partitioned into blocks that are hashed independently; the last block is padded out to a full block length. Each block is fed into an internal compression function which operates on a 512-bit internal state (32 rows and 16 columns). The output from the compression function is added to the starting state using XOR and then permuted using a linear transformation. The final state is then split into two 512-bit halves and XORed together, producing the final version.</p>
<p>Blake hashing algorithm is one of the five finalists in the NIST hash function competition. </p>
<p>A method of reducing a hash value is to XOR it with a constant value, which can allow for more efficient computation on some architectures. The Blake hashing algorithm uses this concept extensively. Although this does not result in any significant reduction in security, it does result in a faster processing time for the algorithm.</p>
<p>The Blake hashing algorithm constructs two independent hash functions that are hashed together to produce a final hash value of 512 bits (64 bytes).</p>
<div>Blake is an iterative hash function that uses randomization to increase security against collisions and preimage attacks while using almost the same amount of resources as SHA-2 (though less than MD5).</div>
<p>Blake has the following features:</p>
<p>Security: Blake is more secure than SHA-2 because it has a larger internal state (1024 bits compared to SHA-2’s 512 bits).</p>
<p>Fast hashing: Blake is one of the fastest cryptographic hash functions around. It surpasses the industry’s leading cryptographic hash function Whirlpool in terms of speed. Speed is essential to many applications, such as password protection.</p>
<p>Stream cipher: This allows an application to hash any amount of data without having to wait until all data has been read. This feature enables applications such as file hashing utilities.</p>

<file>block.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A file containing information on transactions completed during a given time period. Blocks are the constituent parts of a blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<div>Blocks are ordered sequentially, with new blocks added to the end of the chain. Every block contains a reference to the preceding block, in the form of a hash. This is one of the key security features of blockchain technology, making it virtually impossible to forge the ledger.In addition to a timestamp, the transaction record, and the hash of the previous block, every block contains the answer to a unique cryptographic puzzle. Solving this puzzle is a requirement for a new block to be added to the chain — a process called mining. Solving this problem attracts a reward, and so, in the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, every block also includes details of the addresses that have earned that reward. This is the first transaction recorded in each block.In Bitcoin, the difficulty of each problem is determined automatically by the network in an attempt to ensure that the target solution rate is achieved. The difficulty is adjusted by network consensus every 2,016 blocks.The first block in a blockchain is known as the genesis block. This is the only block in the blockchain that does not include a reference to a previous block.The block structure makes blockchains extremely difficult to hack or falsify. Every block in the blockchain contains the hashed reference to all of the preceding data on the chain. This means that in order to change any record on the blockchain, a malicious actor would have to change every single block. This is made virtually impossible by the fact that the blockchain is stored not in a single location, but in a decentralized manner on the local computer of every one of the blockchain's users.</div>

<preview>An application enabling a user to view details of blocks on a given blockchain. Also known as a blockchain browser.</preview>
<description>
<div>Block explorers connect directly to a specific blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. They allow the user to view and query individual blocks — providing visibility to anyone of the transactions or other actions made by holders of individual cryptocurrencies.Block explorers are a key part of cryptocurrency's mission of transparency and decentralization, and the universal visibility of all transaction data is one of the key differentiations between cryptocurrency and conventional currencies. </div>
<p>There are a wide range of block explorers available online, with the most popular including Mempool, Bitaps, Blockstream, Multihash, Blockchain Info, and Bitupper Explorer. </p>
<p>Most include the same or similar information at a glance, focusing on the last blocks that have been added to the blockchain, and the blocks that are about to be added next. </p>
<div>Within each block, information is given on block height, the age of the block, the block reward, the identity of the user or pool of users who mined the block, the TX (or transaction list) showing the number of transactions in the block, and the transaction status — that is, whether a transaction is pending or confirmed.In order to explore specific blocks or transactions, the user of a block explorer must input a specific query. Most commonly this will be the TXID, or transaction hash — a hex sequence used to uniquely identify a specific transaction.While there are many block explorers on offer, relatively few of them support SegWit, the upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain activated in 2017. SegWit-enabled block explorers include Bitaps, Apirone, Blockchair, Bitupper, Cryptoid Chainz, and Poolin Explorer.</div>

<title>Block Header</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block-header</url>
<file>block-header.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A block header is a unique identifier for a block on a blockchain that is hashed on a continuous basis to supply proof-of-work for mining incentives.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Block Header?</h2>
<div>A block header is a means for identifying individual blocks generated inside a blockchain network, with each block containing its own personalized header to facilitate the tracking of protocol modifications. It is used to handle all blocks in a blockchain, which are also known as nodes. It includes all the metadata, block's time and difficulty level, Merkle root of transactions, and the nonce. </div>
<p>Starting with the ‘genesis block’, blocks are stacked in sequence, with each block header including three sets of block information and other unique components, including: </p>
<div>Block headers are frequently used in Bitcoin developer documentation because they make it easier to document tasks at a faster rate. Entire blockchains can be saved as a flat file or a simple database, much like a vertical stack.</div>
<div>Three sets of block metadata are contained in the block header. The blocks are placed at top of each other, with the initial block serving as the base. Blocks continue to rise in height until the blockchain's end is reached and the sequence is completed. One of the things that makes Bitcoin highly safe is the layers and rich history of each sequence.</div>
<div>A block header is hashed periodically by miners by changing the nonce value as part of normal mining activity. Their goal is to build a proof of work through this exercise, which will allow them to be compensated for their efforts to keep the blockchain system functioning smoothly and effectively.</div>
<p>Block headers are excellent for mining, but they are also useful for light clients because of their modest size. The Bitcoin blockchain is just too big to be stored on mobile devices. The block headers for the identical blocks, on the other hand, would only take up 0.008GB, or 8MB of storage space.</p>
<div>Devices with limited bandwidth or storage capacity can nevertheless do some verification in this way. They may subsequently check whether a transaction was included in a specific block since the Merkle root contains all of the transactions. This comes with a price: the user must still rely on a third party to give them the information they want. Light clients, on the other hand, are preferable to a system in which users complete no verification at all.</div>
<p>In a blockchain network, a Merkle root is the hash (of all the hashes) of all the transactions that make up a block. The timestamp is provided so that all project participants can view a permanent, encapsulated record of when a specific event occurred. It normally displays the date and time of the event, and it is usually precise to a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>The difficulty target is used to adjust how hard the block is to solve for the miners. The nonce is a variable that miners may tweak to produce different permutations and valid hashes in the sequence.</p>
<p>Block headers, in summary, are used to target certain blocks inside a blockchain. They are hashed in return for mining payouts to provide proof of work. </p>

<title>Block Height</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block-height</url>
<file>block-height.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A value describing the number of blocks preceding a given block in the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<div>Every blockchain is made up of a series of blocks, organized sequentially. Each block stores information about transactions that were conducted on the blockchain during a given time period. Blocks are added to the end of the blockchain at given intervals.The block height, therefore, is a measure of the number of blocks that have been created on the blockchain prior to the block in question. It could also be thought of as b-1, where b equals the total length of the blockchain.Every block in the blockchain has an associated block height value. The first block in the blockchain, known as the genesis block, has a block height of zero, reflecting the fact that there are no blocks before it in the chain.Block height is an important measure of the rate at which new blocks are being added to the blockchain in question. It is also used as an identifier for each individual block.However, in some circumstances, two blocks might have the same block height. Blocks are created when a cryptographic problem is solved by a miner or group of miners. So, if the same problem is solved simultaneously by more than one party, two blocks will be created with the same block height. This may precipitate a fork, or it may result in a block being orphaned. Whichever outcome occurs, duplicate blocks cannot appear on any one given blockchain.Block height is one of the key pieces of information displayed on block explorers. It is also one of the most useful pieces of information for users wishing to find details of specific blocks or transactions using an explorer.</div>

<title>Block Producer</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block-producer</url>
<file>block-producer.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A block producer (BP) is a person or group whose hardware is chosen to verify a block's transactions and begin the next block on most Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Block Producer?</h2>
<div>Block producer is a term used in blockchain ecosystems that use Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), which allows users to vote block producers to validate and generate blocks. Block producers are also known as delegates or witnesses. They are in charge of producing new blocks that contain recent network transactions as well as blockchain evidence that the chain's present state is legitimate.</div>
<p>Block producers are critical to the network's functioning. They collect transaction data and store it in blocks to validate them on blockchain networks. Blocks are transmitted to the network for validation after they have been prepared. Block producer who produce blocks upload the transaction data to the blockchain after they have been validated.</p>
<div>To understand the concept of BP in more detail, consider the example of EOS block producers. The EOS network is governed by Block Producers, who are decentralized entities. They are in charge of achieving consensus and delivering transaction or data blocks to the EOS network. They act similar to miners on a proof-of-work (PoW) network and staking nodes on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.</div>
<p>Miners on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain, such as bitcoin, use a lot of computing power to solve complicated mathematical problems. When the equation is completed by a miner, it is broadcasted on the network to verify by other miners, and the consensus is established. After that, the block is put to the chain, the miner who completes the equation, receives his block reward, and everyone continues to the next equation.</p>
<div>On a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network, like Cardano, nodes stake a certain quantity of tokens (basically locking them up in a specific wallet address for a set length of time) in exchange for the opportunity to be chosen to add the next block of transactions to the chain.</div>
<p>Despite the notion that the selection is randomized, variables such as the amount invested, the length of time for which it has been staked, and the node's reputation are frequently taken into account.</p>
<p>Delegated proof-of-stake is a variant of PoS in which validators are elected by the network's token holders rather than being picked at random.</p>
<p>According to the EOS white paper, the block in the EOS.IO application will be generated by 21 producers known as &quot;block producers.&quot; The EOS design employs Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), which involves the community selecting trusted accounts (also known as &quot;trustees&quot;) to produce blocks. Short block creation time, great efficiency, and practically little possibility of forking are some of the benefits of DPOS.</p>
<div>All EOS token holders in the EOS mainnet vote for 21 trustworthy accounts to act as block producers and make decisions on their behalf. They are chosen from the top 21 Block candidates with the highest votes.</div>
<div>The chosen block producers assist the EOS mainnet with processing power and bandwidth. Their primary responsibility is to gather transaction data, bundle it into blocks, and disseminate those blocks to other block producers. They submit the blocks to the blockchain and get rewarded after the verification is done. However, if any of the top 21 block producers do not generate any blocks for the next 24 hours, they will be taken off the list.</div>
<p>The EOS block producer initiative has gained such traction that Google Cloud would become a block producer contender on the EOS network, which is based on Block.one's EOSIO blockchain architecture.</p>
<p>The interest of the Big tech in block producer projects is a good sign for all the ventures similar to EOS as this industry continues to grow.</p>

<title>Block Reward</title>

<file>block-reward.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The coins awarded to a miner or group of miners for solving the cryptographic problem required to create a new block on a given blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<div>‍Blockchains are sequences of individual blocks, each of which contains a record of transactions completed within a given period. Each block has an associated cryptographic hashing problem. This problem must be solved in order for the block to be created and added to the blockchain. Users of the blockchain are rewarded with cryptocurrency for solving these problems.The process of solving hashing problems is known as mining. Most blocks on Bitcoin and other blockchains are created by groups of miners using specific mining equipment. In the case of Bitcoin, the asset was originally designed to be mined using conventional CPUs. But, as time went on, it became more efficient to use GPUs and, eventually, dedicated hardware known as ASICs.On the Bitcoin blockchain, the original reward for solving a hashing problem was 50 BTC. However, this reward has been gradually reduced over time — falling by 50% every 210,000 blocks. This event is known as halving. At the current rate of discovery, a Bitcoin halving occurs around every four years. After 64 halvings, the reward will reach zero.Block rewards are conferred on the relevant miner as the first transaction recorded in the given block. Bitcoin mining is now generally only viable as a profitable exercise for extremely large-scale mining operations, using expensive hardware in tightly controlled conditions and in locations with low energy costs.</div>

<title>Block Size</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block-size</url>
<file>block-size.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>In blockchain technology, block size refers to the amount of data about transactions a single block in the chain can carry.</preview>
<description>
<div>Blocks are some of the smallest components in a blockchain ledger. Essentially, blocks are bundles of transaction data clumped together, which are later combined in a chain that forms the distributed ledger. </div>
<h2>What Is Block Size?</h2>
<div>Block size is pretty straightforward — it is the amount of data a single block can hold. For example, as of May 2021, one block on the Bitcoin blockchain can hold data equivalent to 1 MB. This limitation was enforced in 2010, in an effort to limit the opportunity for overwhelming the blockchain and stop possible DoS attacks. </div>
<p>Initially, the Bitcoin blockchain was designed to work with blocks of up to 36 MB in size; however, security concerns enforced the need for significantly smaller block sizes. </p>
<h2>Why Is Block Size Important?</h2>
<p>One of the main concerns when it comes to block size for blockchains is the overloading of the network. The faster blocks fill up with transactions, the bigger the chance for longer wait times for transaction approval. For example, Bitcoin’s blockchain is more prone to slower transaction processing because of the small block size of only 1 MB. In a hypothetical situation where nodes cannot cope with the number of pending transactions because of the limited size of blocks, users might suffer from very slow processing speeds, or even canceled transfers. </p>
<p>This is unacceptable for a new-age financial solution which aims to revolutionize the global economy. Consequently, there are numerous experiments in the works that are trying to solve the block size dilemma. </p>
<div>There is also the flip side of the coin, which argues that small block size is the foundation of a self-regulated market. For example, the Ethereum blockchain allows users to pay a larger fee in order for their transactions to be processed with priority. In other words, some analysts point out that because of the limited block size, users have the option to prioritize their transactions to be processed first by paying more in gas fees. This system is one of the founding principles of a decentralized network.</div>
<p>For the moment there is no consensus on what the best approach to solving the block size problem might be. Most blockchain networks are looking into ways to optimize the use of blocks, and simultaneously prevent security concerns. </p>

<file>block-time.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Block time refers to the approximate time it takes for a blockchain-based system to produce a new block.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Block Time?</h2>
<div>Block time refers to the approximate time it takes for a blockchain-based system to produce a new block, dictating the speed of transaction confirmation, which is measured in transactions per second (TPS). When a block reaches completion, it appears on the ledger as a verified copy of a group of transactions, paving the way for another block to sit on top of it to extend the chain. </div>
<div>Increasing the block size provides a simple and effective way to lower block time, however, there is a long-running debate on whether this strategy affects a decentralized network’s security. For instance, Greg Maxwell, a BTC contributor, holds that a higher block time is more ideal since it allows enough time to update nodes/computers connected to a distributed platform and lowers the number of rejected blocks. </div>
<div>Block time may also refer to the length of time it takes a validator in a blockchain network to solve a transaction hash. While these are time estimates, the actual time depends on the mining difficulty. </div>
<div>Block time forms part of the components necessary for improving a blockchain’s scalability. One of the factors that affect block time is network congestion, where too many users are conducting transactions on the network.</div>
<div>Note that Bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes while Ethereum, the second-largest decentralized protocol, has an average block time of 15 seconds.</div>

<title>Block Trade</title>

<file>block-trade.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A block trade is a large-scale purchase or sale of securities that occur outside of an open market. It uses blockhouse as a financial intermediary to aid investors with risk management.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Block Trade?</h2>
<div>The essence of a large order transaction is referred to as a &quot;block trade.&quot; A blockhouse, which is a financial intermediary committed to aiding investors with risk management, is frequently used to conduct block transactions. it is a method where traders simultaneously purchase and sell a significant number of securities without affecting the market price. </div>
<div>Block trading is generally done by institutions and hedge funds due to the enormous magnitude of the transactions. This form of trading is comparable to over-the-counter trading (OTC Trading) because of its confidential nature.</div>
<div>Individual investors are not too keen on making block transactions because of the magnitude of trades in both the debt and equity markets. In practice, big hedge funds and large-scale investors purchase and sell enormous quantities of bonds and shares in block transactions through investment banks and other mediators.</div>
<p>If a block trade is made on the open market, traders must exercise caution since the transaction might result in substantial volume changes and have an influence on the market value of the shares or bonds being acquired. As a result, instead of acquiring assets directly from a hedge fund or investment bank as they would for lesser sums, block trades are generally done through a middleman.</p>
<div>A block trade should contain at least 10,000 shares in the stock market or $200,000 in bonds in the treasuries market, as per the New York Stock Exchange, but this amount is usually much greater in reality. These aren't penny stocks; they are well-known corporations or blue-chip equities. Blocks are classified as over-the-counter (OTC) commodities since they are traded outside the open market or a centralized exchange. As the open market fluctuates in terms of asset value and volume, this serves to maintain the price of the securities.</div>
<div>Blockchain has a significant role in the futures market. Futures trading is a contract that permits two parties to purchase and sell a financial asset at a predetermined price on a future date. This is comparable to block trading but on a much bigger level. </div>
<div>In contrast, these derivatives often deal with tiny securities orders and include stocks, foreign currency, commodities, and indexes. A block transaction in futures or options produces a contract that stands out from others in the same genre.</div>
<p>Consider the following scenario to better understand block trading: If a hedge fund wants to sell 350,000 shares of a company for $5 each, it can do it in one or multiple transactions. A blockhouse connects buyers and sellers, negotiates a contract, and sees it through. Now, it can decide to sell all 350,000 shares at once to one interested party, or it may find 35 buyers who buy 10,000 shares, each.</p>
<div>All of these transactions occur simultaneously. By employing a blockhouse, this legislation claims to keep market volatility low and minimize slippage between trades, as financial securities sometimes alter prices unexpectedly.</div>
<p>Block trading follows the same principles (more or less) in the blockchain environment. Many major crypto exchanges offer this feature. Binance, for example, provides customers with a customized block trading mechanism to trade big block sizes, usually greater than 10 BTC. It also provides over-the-counter (OTC) trading which is a viable alternative to trading directly on exchange order books for big orders, when an investor risks affecting the token's market price and lowering their execution level. </p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A distributed ledger system. A sequence of blocks, or units of digital information, stored consecutively in a public database. The basis for cryptocurrencies.</preview>
<description>
<div>Blockchains are made up of a series of individual blocks. Each block contains information about transactions conducted within a given time period. They also contain a unique identifier to differentiate them from every other block in the chain.Blocks are created by solving cryptographic problems. The process of solving these problems is known as mining. Mining a block on the blockchain attracts a reward. For example, at the inception of the Bitcoin blockchain, miners solving the cryptographic hashing problem required to add a new block to the blockchain were rewarded with 50 BTC.Blockchains are decentralized records. Instead of being stored in one central location, the blockchain is stored on the computers of every user of that given blockchain. </div>
<div>Meanwhile, the unique block identifier — known as the hash — is derived from the information contained in every previous block in the blockchain. This means that, in order to falsify any record on the blockchain, a nefarious actor would have to change every block on every instance of the blockchain. As a result, blockchains are considered to be virtually unfalsifiable, and are thought of as immutable records of transactions.Today, most blockchains are public. This includes prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Anybody can view records of transactions conducted on a given blockchain, using a tool called a block explorer. Theoretically however, blockchains afford a high level of anonymity to users. </div>
<p>While public blockchains are the norm, private versions are also being explored as a solution for many business and governmental use cases.</p>

<title>Blockchain 1.0</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain-1-0</url>
<file>blockchain-1-0.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Blockchain 1.0 is the first generation of blockchain technology, which focuses on cryptocurrency and decentralization.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Blockchain 1.0?</h2>
<div>Blockchain technology has been rapidly developing since Satoshi Nakamoto first published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008. Blockchain 1.0 is the first evolutionary phase of the development of this technology. It was derived from the original technological structure of Bitcoin, which was based on previous developments of ECash systems from the 1980s and 1990s.</div>
<p>The idea behind Blockchain 1.0 was to create a revolutionary new way to approach finances. With the introduction of a completely decentralized, distributed and immutable online record of transactions, Blockchain 1.0 aims to bring transparency and public access to the global financial system. </p>
<div>The introduction of Bitcoin as a blockchain-based digital money solution gave the start of Blockchain 1.0. Developers started experimenting with the possibilities distributed ledger technology (DLT) can bring to the world of finance. Bitcoin and the underlying technology inspired the gradual creation of numerous other Blockchain 1.0 projects. Not only that, blockchain technology displayed the potential to disrupt countless other industries; however, Blockchain 1.0 developments were explicitly focused on the creation of cryptocurrencies. As the technology improved and developed, Blockchain 2.0 and 3.0 emerged, and they brought on much more extensive capabilities. </div>
<p>Blockchain 1.0 is an essential stage of the growth of cryptocurrencies as a global phenomenon. For the first time in the world’s financial history, monetary transactions became completely decentralized, which meant that there wasn’t a single company or organization determining the rules of the system. Blockchain 1.0 was a radical new approach to what both personal and enterprise finance should be. It was the beginning of a revolutionary new way of thinking. While cryptocurrencies were slow to catch the attention of global players in the financial world, Blockchain 1.0 was a significant move forward to a completely fair and transparent monetary world. </p>
<div>Today, blockchain technology has advanced tremendously. With the introduction of Blockchain 2.0, we saw the development of smart contract capabilities. With the introduction of the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts became one of the most utilized functionalities of blockchain technology. With Blockchain 2.0, developers started working on creating more DApps and DAOs. Now we are headed towards the third evolutionary stage of blockchain technology, Blockchain 3.0, which will see major enterprise and institutional adoption of the tech. In its final growth stage, blockchain technology will become widely accepted as an industry standard for how companies and organizations run their finances and internal and external operations. While there has been undeniable progress, none of this would have been possible without the introduction of Blcockahin 1.0.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Blockchain 2.0?</h2>
<div>Blockchain 2.0 is based on the concept of exchanging value in a decentralized and peer-to-peer fashion.</div>
<div>A blockchain is a distributed ledger system that stores all transactions and data in a public database. It is viewed as a major technological breakthrough, with the potential to impact a wide range of organizational operations.</div>
<div>By far the most well-known implementation of blockchain technology is Bitcoin. Bitcoins are used to keep transactions in the cryptocurrency's blockchain, which is a decentralized ledger. In addition to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology offers a wide range of present and future uses.</div>
<div>Satoshi Nakamoto, the purported creator(s) of the blockchain, never envisioned blockchain technology as being confined to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They predicted in 2010 that blockchain technology can revolutionize payment procedures. This growth of blockchain technology's use in new applications is precisely what the founder(s) of Bitcoin envisioned.</div>
<div>The terminology &quot;blockchain 2.0&quot; is used to differentiate between Bitcoin as an asset and the blockchain as a programmed distributed trust infrastructure in particular, with additional scalable on-chain utility and extensible capabilities. Instead of focusing on the decentralization of money and payments, blockchain 2.0 broadens the capabilities of this technology to facilitate the decentralization of markets in general, allowing for the exchange of other types of assets such as certificates, rights, and responsibilities in real estate, intellectual property, cars, and artworks.</div>
<div>Smart contracts are agreements embedded in lines of codes enabled by blockchain technology. These codes can be included in a blockchain 2.0 application as part of an entry. Due to the level of trust embedded into the blockchain as a database that cannot be faked or manipulated, smart contracts between parties who have never met may now enter into agreements with hesitation.</div>
<p>The necessity for physical connectivity becomes evident as we progress toward blockchain 2.0 applications. The simplest aspect may be establishing a blockchain-based land registry on a server or writing a smart contract to be logged as a transaction on a blockchain application. Validating a claim of ownership to a property is difficult in the real world and using blockchain can prove to be helpful in this case.</p>
<p>In general, data recorded on blockchain 2.0 apps must be legitimate and in accordance with the relevant legislation. These also frequently require certification by some government body or local authorities that applicable regulatory criteria have been met.</p>
<div>Since business owners may have reservations that are difficult to overcome, cryptocurrencies have seen substantial growth due to Blockchain 2.0. Crypto miners also enjoy a wide range of alternatives. As Bitcoin dominates around 40-50% of the crypto market, other cryptocurrencies have more room to gather the attention of the market. Ethereum, for example, currently has a market capitalization of more than 10%</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Blockchain 3.0?</h2>
<div>Blockchain technology has been a global phenomenon since the introduction of the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008. At first, the technology was focused exclusively on the creation of various cryptocurrencies. However, as software developers and engineers started exploring the capabilities of blockchain technology, numerous new applications arose. With Blockchain 3.0, developers are looking for ways to seamlessly integrate the technology across different industries to optimize their performance. </div>
<p>Blockchain technology has the potential to completely turn around the way companies handle data and other sensitive information. The applications of distributed ledgers and blockchains are virtually limitless, and Blockchain 3.0 is the generation where this technology will be widely incorporated into our daily lives. In terms of applications, there are several industries where blockchain tech has already made revolutionary changes. For example:</p>
<div>These are just a few examples of revolutionary applications for blockchain technology outside of cryptocurrency and financial systems. Blockchain 3.0 focuses on creating solutions for services and industries outside the world of economics. This final evolutionary stage of the technology is dedicated to transcending the purely financial application of DLT and introducing new approaches to data management. Of course, the global adoption of blockchain technology will happen gradually as more private parties start developing customized blockchain solutions for different industries. Even so, we are already witnessing the revolutionary power of Blockchain 3.0. The journey towards global adoption began with the introduction of cryptocurrency, then came smart contracts and DApps, and now blockchain is taking over optimizations in numerous industries.</div>
<div>Of course, blockchain technology is not completely flawless, and one of the main focuses of Blockchain 3.0 projects is to polish and improve the technology itself. Concerns like the energy consumption of proof-of-work (PoW) systems have been coming to the forefront, so now developers are working on alternative consensus mechanisms to reach better scalability and efficiency for blockchains.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Blockchain Explorer?</h2>
<div>Blockchain explorers facilitate one of the most important features of blockchain technology — browsing through the records of the distributed ledger. Transparency is one of the main characteristics of cryptocurrencies, and blockchain explorers allow users to benefit from it. Most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) feature public ledgers, where all transactions approved by node operators are recorded. However, with the growing adoption of these tokens, thousands of transactions are processed each minute, making it hard to extract information from the blockchain. </div>
<div>This is where blockchain explorers play a vital role. They allow users to type in a public or private address and receive information about all transactions going to and from this address. Blockchain explorers also provide information about all blocks added to the chain and the rate at which transactions are being processed. </div>
<div>The way a blockchain explorer works is simple. When a user types in a search query in the interface of the explorer, the software sends it out. Through an application programming interface (API), the blockchain explorer connects to a node and starts extracting the requested information. Once all relevant data has been extracted, the blockchain explorer orders and lists it and presents it to the user in a searchable format. Depending on the explorer you decide to use, you might also be able to check the current status of transaction validation, how many outstanding requests there are and explore the list of unconfirmed transactions. </div>
<div>While blockchain explorers are designed to facilitate and promote the transparency of distributed ledger technology (DLT), there are tools that can protect the anonymity of addresses transacting on the blockchain. Coin mixers are the most popular tool used to hide the origin of a transaction. When a user sends their fund to a coin mixer, the software combines several other incoming transactions and sends the final address a completely new set of tokens, which cannot be traced. This means that while the transaction will be recorded on the blockchain, its destination address will not be revealed in the record, as it will show up as the address of the coin mixer. </div>
<div>Even so, blockchain explorers are an essential service, as they facilitate important access to data recorded in the ledger. If you are curious to know more about blockchain explorers and would like to try using one, check out our detailed Blockchain Explorer Guide, and jump right in.</div>

<title>Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain-transmission-protocol-btp</url>
<file>blockchain-transmission-protocol-btp.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP) enables isolated blockchains to operate as a fully decentralized settlement layer by securely anchoring transactions using a protocol that is universal.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP)?</h2>
<p>BTP is a technology that allows diverse blockchains, even those with wholly distinct algorithms and consensus models, to be compatible, enabling service invocation, value transfer, and data exchange. </p>
<p>Token exchanges across multiple blockchains are a good application for BTP since BTP permits such exchanges directly via smart contracts through one blockchain to the next without the need for an intermediate trading platform.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BTP enables data transfers across partners powered by ICONLOOP, for example, MyID apps. The MyID program verifies Decentralized ID (DID) credentials on the open ICON Network, allowing its user to send messages to any private or public network which is interconnected through BTP, without needing to submit their DID credentials and key to each blockchain.</p>
<div>BTP can also streamline the issuance of certificates for blockchains. Broof is a public ICON network service that lets users create and store validated certificates on its chain. BTP can trigger the issuance mechanism of a smart contract on the ICON Network.</div>
<h2>What Is the ICON Network?</h2>
<p>The majority of recent decentralized applications and blockchain projects have operated in isolation. As a result, the blockchain industry has disintegrated into a hodgepodge of fragmented blockchains.</p>
<p>The ICON Network aims to connect these blockchains such that they are interoperable. The platform that allows for this to happen is known as Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP).</p>
<h2>The Building Blocks of Blockchain Transmission Protocol</h2>
<p>BTP follows a set of functions and standards that must be followed in order to properly transfer data and maintain its validity and integrity. These standards include message specifications, message relayers, message verifiers, and service smart contracts.</p>
<p>All messages should have recipient, sender, serial number, service name, and service data.</p>
<p>This is the application that retrieves and delivers BTP messages.</p>
<p>Data gathered from relayers is validated by message verifiers.</p>
<p>BTP messages that are verified are forwarded to SSC, which then executes the transmission from the smart contract of the source blockchain to the smart contract of the destination blockchain.</p>
<h2>How Does Blockchain Transmission Protocol Work?</h2>
<p>BTP only links two chains, but the linked chains can additionally link to more chains, forming a network of interconnected and interoperable blockchains. </p>
<p>Furthermore, because BTP validates external data through smart contracts, all validation operations are easily accessible and open to audit and verification.</p>
<p>In an asynchronous network, the relayer/sender blockchain may halt delivering data if there is a momentary connection disruption, but they can later be recovered and re-sent when the connection is repaired, suffering no data loss.</p>
<p>Blockchain Transmission Protocol is designed to be versatile, meaning it allows blockchains that don't enable smart contracts to halfway participate in BTP transactions, such that the blockchain that doesn’t support smart contracts can’t participate as a receiver chain, but can be the sender chain.</p>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>The blockchain trilemma is the set of three issues that plague blockchains: decentralization, security and scalability.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Blockchain Trilemma?</h2>
<div>The blockchain trilemma is a concept coined by Vitalik Buterin that proposes a set of three main issues — decentralization, security and scalability — that developers encounter when building blockchains, forcing them to ultimately sacrifice one &quot;aspect&quot; for as a trade-off to accommodate the other two. </div>
<p>It is a widely held belief that decentralized networks can only provide two of three benefits at any given time concerning decentralization, security, and scalability. </p>
<p>However, ongoing innovation across the decentralized ecosystem has led to a diverse range of Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions that are overcoming these obstacles to solve the trilemma once and for all in the following fashion: </p>
<p>Decentralization. Rather than being managed by a single entity, blockchains distribute control over the network equally to all participants. </p>
<div>- Security. Blockchain networks should have ironclad defences that prevent malicious entities from taking over. </div>
<p>- Scalability. Blockchains should support an enormous number of transactions and users without faltering by increasing fees and transaction times. </p>
<div>For some in the industry, achieving all three aspects is an impossible feat that will never be achieved, at least not in the near future. However, there are still ambitious developers who believe that blockchain networks can indeed have all three and more. One example of a cryptocurrency project touting that they’re solving the blockchain trilemma is Algorand.</div>

<title>Blockchain-Enabled Smart Locks</title>

<file>blockchain-enabled-smart-locks.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Blockchain-enabled smart locks solve many security issues and can be locked or unlocked based on the state of a variable that is embedded in a smart contract.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Blockchain-Enabled Smart Locks?</h2>
<div>A smart lock is a connected device that can be controlled digitally from a device like a mobile phone. Consumer-grade smart locks have become increasingly popular in homes over the past few years, but they are vulnerable to potential cybersecurity issues. Blockchain-enabled smart locks solve many of these security issues and can be locked or unlocked based on the state of a variable that is embedded in a smart contract. The almost unlimited programmability, and the fact that you can easily link any kind of payment method (e.g. tokens or oracles) with the state of the lock, opens up incredible new business models that were previously impossible due to security concerns. </div>
<div>Using a smart contract as the underlying logic layer to decide whether to lock or unlock adds versatility and security to the standard smart lock concept. The addresses could, for example, be tied to a digital identity, so it is possible to track who is ‘coming and going,’ enabling the creation of temporary or entry codes. For homes, this is useful for allowing guests or service people to enter a home if the homeowner is away. This also means new commercial applications in offices, hotels, or rentals. For example, you could program a lock to open as a result of &quot;rent being paid,&quot; or have a high-security multisign lock that requires a certain number of different addresses to approve the state change.</div>
<div>Aside from the programmability, blockchain-enabled locks are much more secure than a traditional smart device, with the same digital benefits. The instructions to lock and unlock can be sent from any place on the globe, and with blockchain’s inherent security this means collaboration and joint signatures are possible without needing additional security infrastructure. </div>
<div>There are a couple of downsides. A blockchain-enabled solution can, however, be vulnerable to a loss of connectivity as it relies on access to a decentralized network of nodes. And just like a mechanical lock, losing your private key could mean being locked out without any recovery mechanisms. On a public blockchain, there are also the potential issues of lack of privacy and processing time.</div>
<div>Despite these potential cons, a blockchain-enabled smart lock can make novel business cases possible with its programmability and native connection with the token world.</div>

<title>Bollinger Band</title>

<file>bollinger-band.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A tool developed by Bollinger to help in the recognition of systemic pattern recognition in prices; it is a band that is plotted two standard deviations away from the simple moving average, o</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bollinger Band?</h2>
<p>A bollinger band is a technical analysis tool named after the esteemed technical trader who designed it — John Bollinger. Bollinger bands consist of three lines:</p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, bollinger bands are applied to the daily chart of BTC/USD traded at Coinbase. The upper band is plotted two standard deviations above the 20 period MA, while the lower band is plotted two standard deviations below. Standard deviation measures the difference between a group of values from the mean, making it a good indicator of volatility. As the bands expand, it indicates that the market is becoming more volatile as prices move away from the lagging 20 MA. As bands contract, it indicates that the market is becoming less volatile.</p>
<h2>How Do Traders Use Bollinger Bands?</h2>
<p>As bollinger bands measure volatility, or lack thereof, there are two ways that traders can construct strategies around them.</p>
<p>The first way traders utilize bollinger bands is to wait for the market to approach the upper or lower bands before taking action. As the price trades closer towards the bands, the possibility becomes greater that the market is overbought (upper band) or oversold (lower band). Hence, the mean reversion trader will execute a short when the price touches the upper band, and a long when the price touches the lower.</p>
<p>Caution: this simplistic strategy may not be the most applicable for explosive and trending markets like Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. Mean reversion may be more suited for less volatile markets.</p>
<p>The second way traders utilize Bollinger Bands is to trade breakouts. This is done by executing a trade in the direction that the price breaches the band. If the price breaches the top band, enter a long position, and if price breaches the lower band, enter a short. This is best executed in tandem with the bands narrowing, which could be a good signal that the market is readying itself for an explosive move.</p>
<p>Using bollinger bands for breakout trades on Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is recommended over mean reversion trades, as cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and tend to trend for prolonged periods. Do your own research before trading!</p>
<h2>How Are Bollinger Bands Calculated?</h2>
<p>The formula to calculate bollinger bands are as follows:</p>
<p>Middle Band = MA[Source Price, n]</p>
<p>Upper Band = MA[Source Price, n] + (m * n period standard deviation)</p>
<p>Lower Band = MA[Source Price, n] - (m * n period standard deviation)</p>
<div>Where source price can be open, high, low, close, etc. (chosen by user)</div>
<div>n = number of periods (chosen by user)</div>
<div>m = standard deviations (chosen by user)</div>

<file>bonding-curve.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship between the price and the supply of a given asset.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bonding Curve?</h2>
<p>A bonding curve is a mathematical concept used to describe the relationship between price and the supply of an asset.</p>
<p>The basis of the bonding curve is the idea that when a person purchases an asset that is available in a limited quantity (like Bitcoin), then each subsequent buyer will have to pay slightly more for it. The reason for this increase in price is that the number of available asset units decreases with each one that is acquired. This mechanism should, supposedly, bring profits to the earliest investors.</p>
<p>More recently, the cryptocurrency space also saw the creation of so-called bonding curve contracts. Those are token issuance smart contracts that create a market for the tokens that is independent from cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>Bonding curve contracts sell the tokens to users by calculating the token price in Ether and issuing them after the payment, also buying them and paying with Ether. In both cases, the smart contract calculates the average price and bases the rate off of that.</p>
<p>There is no hard limit on the number of these kinds of tokens that can be created; instead, the quantity of Ether in existence and the price curve limits how many can circulate in the market. Usually, bonding curve contracts ensure that the price of each token increases as the number of tokens issued increases.</p>

<description>
<div>Trading bots have been used on stock markets for several decades, arguably reaching their zenith with complex high-frequency trading (HFT) software. The most advanced bots can analyze many markets at once, and automatically buy or sell in response to real-time changes.Advocates of trading bots point to several key advantages over human trading. Bots are far speedier than humans, and they don't need to rest. They are also not influenced by emotion, simply making the choices that are statistically most beneficial. Finally, bots can handle vast amounts of data — ingesting and analyzing infinitely more information than a human can in the same time period.In crypto trading, bots have several common applications. They can be used to automate time consuming but mundane tasks such as regular portfolio rebalancing. They can be used to ensure that orders are executed at precisely the desired time — for example, to execute a sell order when an asset reaches a specific threshold. They can also simplify trades that would otherwise be too complex for a human to carry out.Most crypto trading bots will fall into one of four categories: arbitrage, market making, technical trading, or profile automation. There are many off-the-shelf bots available within all of these categories, or users might decide to code their own.While bots can simplify trading, it is far from guaranteed that they will be profitable. The byzantine algorithms and vast computing power available to the largest institutional investors enables them to gain a real competitive advantage, but these are not available to the average crypto trader. However, even open-source bots can eke out marginal profits that can still represent improvements over index tracking.</div>

<title>Bounty</title>

<file>bounty.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A cryptocurrency bounty is a reward users receive for performing tasks assigned by a given blockchain or project.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bounty?</h2>
<div>Crypto bounties are an important rewards mechanism that blockchain projects utilize in order to secure the successful accomplishments of certain tasks required by the network. Initially, bounties were intended as a marketing tool to attract users to participate in performing validation services for blockchain projects. Today, crypto bounties have developed significantly beyond the purpose of a simple marketing tool.</div>
<div>One of the main purposes of a bounty rewards program is to promote the initial coin offering (ICO) of a token. Much like traditional initial public offerings, ICOs need to generate a lot of attention to be successful. Bounty reward programs are a great way to create awareness and engagement for a new token. The way bounties work is simple. The project looking to push its ICO announces a promotion campaign in which users perform marketing actions and receive tokens in return. These marketing actions can be anything from posting a photo or video promoting the project to publishing reviews in forums and online community boards. In return for performing these promotional actions, users receive either free or discounted tokens.</div>
<div>Bounty rewards campaigns were a huge phenomenon during the ICO craze in 2017 and 2018. Unfortunately, this marketing tool was often employed by fraudulent projects in order to promote fake tokens. This has made many crypto enthusiasts wary of bounty rewards programs. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has deemed some ICOs and bounty rewards programs illegal and used them as proof of wrongdoing in front of courts.</div>
<div>Despite numerous controversial cases, bounty rewards programs remain a very widespread marketing tactic for promoting new tokens. Not only that, some blockchain projects incorporate bounty rewards even after the successful launch of the token. Post-ICO rewards schemes are focused on boosting the development of the project. During them, developers are incentivized to go through the code of the project and localize bugs. In addition, bounty rewards may be offered for translation services aimed at making the project more globally accessible. </div>
<p>The abundance of bounty rewards programs has created a new persona in the cryptocurrency world — a crypto bounty hunter. Bounty hunters are people pursuing a number of rewards programs, seeking to benefit from all of them simultaneously. Much like bounty hunters in the Wild West, crypto bounty hunters always chase the best-paying rewards programs and race to be the ones to claim the reward. </p>
<p>Even with the high level of controversy surrounding bounty rewards programs, this is still a widely used marketing strategy by cryptocurrency projects.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Brave Browser?</h2>
<p>Co-founded by Brendan Eich, one of the creators of the Mozilla Firefox browser, Brave Browser is one of the most popular alternative browser providers. Functioning much like Chrome and Firefox, Brave Browser is a software application allowing users to browse through the internet, visit websites and use online applications. The main difference between Brave Browser and traditional browsers is the approach towards advertisements. </p>
<div>While traditional browsers allow publishers to post advertisements and benefit from clicks, Brave takes on a different approach. The browser’s code is structured in such a way that it automatically strips down all advertisements from a website, and replaces them with ones selected by Brave Browser instead. Users of the browsers are rewarded with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) for viewing ads provided by Brave Browser. Aside from this innovative approach towards online advertising and rewards, Brave also boasts significantly faster search speeds. According to the official Brave documentation, the browser is several times faster than the industry leader Chrome. This is not surprising, considering the fact that advertisement scripts traditionally slow down browser functions. </div>
<p>Another innovative characteristic of the Brave Browser is the complete removal of ad tracking software. Many websites integrate ad tracking scripts in their code that follow users’ activity and extract behavioral data. In recent years, ad tracking software has been deemed as one of the biggest challenges to personal privacy. By removing ad tracking scripts, Brave boasts to be one of the best browsers in terms of data privacy and the protection of personal information. </p>
<div>Brave Browser is built on top of Chromium, Google’s open-source code, which also serves as the foundation of the Chrome browser. This allows Brave to support browser extensions built for Chrome. </div>
<p>While Brave Browser offers undeniable benefits for its users, the software has come under fire for stripping publishers of their earnings. Numerous publishing companies spoke up against Brave and argued that the browser is essentially using content created by them while receiving the advertisement rewards. More than fifteen newspaper publishers filed lawsuits against Brave for stealing content created by them.</p>
<div>Despite its controversial approach towards ads, Brave is one of the preferred browsers among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, because of the blockchain-based ecosystem behind the browser. Brave Browser aims to create a completely revolutionary approach to advertising by allowing users to contribute and reward ad providers with BAT tokens. This means that users have full control over the ads they would like to reward. Additionally, users are incentivized for viewing ads. This revolutionary approach, tightly connected with the principles of blockchain technology has made Brave one of the go-to service providers in the cryptocurrency industry.</div>

<title>Bridges</title>

<file>bridges.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A blockchain bridge allows the seamless transfer of data or tokens between two different blockchain projects.</preview>
<description>
<div>While blockchain technology is undeniably a huge advancement, there are still numerous areas left for improvement. One of the main challenges blockchain projects face is their limited interoperability. For example, a decentralized application (DApp) created on the Ethereum blockchain would not work on the Bitcoin blockchain. </div>
<h2>What Is a Bridge?</h2>
<div>A blockchain bridge is a protocol that outlines minting and burning procedures so that the token supply can be constant between two different platforms. Bridges serve as a transition between the different blockchain protocols. When a token is locked up in one of the blockchain protocols, its equivalent is minted on the second blockchain, allowing interoperability between two completely different protocols. This transfer happens under the mint-and-burn protocol.  </div>
<div>Blockchain bridges are extremely useful for developers because they allow them to benefit from faster processing speeds on less overloaded blockchains. One of the most popular examples of a recent successful blockchain bridge is between Tezos and Ethereum. One of the easiest ways to make blockchain protocols interoperable is by creating wrapped tokens. For example, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) tokens are ERC-20 compatible and can be used in the Ethereum ecosystem. In the case of Tezos, the blockchain bridge allows Ethereum-based tokens to go through a Wrap Protocol, so they become compatible with the Tezos FA2 token standard.</div>
<div>While blockchain bridges usually aim to connect two completely different blockchains, there are also instances where side chains are bridged to their source blockchain. This is done when the parent and child blockchains are operating based on different consensus mechanisms. A well-known side chain bridge of the Ethereum blockchain was created to host the game Axie Infinity. The side chain called Ronin and the original Ethereum blockchain were bridged so that users of the Ronin blockchain can use ERC-20 tokens and NFTs deposited on Ethereum. </div>
<div>Stablecoin protocols are predominantly interested in creating bridges for their blockchains, and especially tokens like Tether (USDT), which is rapidly growing in popularity. For the moment, stablecoins have only been able to expand the number of exchanges that support them; however, through successful bridges, they will rapidly expand their services. </div>
<p>Blockchain bridges are extremely valuable, and they bring a number of benefits to users. Interoperability between different blockchains can allow developers to delegate tasks and optimize the performance of their applications. While some blockchains are better at handling transactions faster, other protocols are designed to handle more smart contracts simultaneously. Blockchain bridges are the perfect tool that lets developers combine these functionalities and reach interoperability.</p>

<h2>What Is a Browser Extension?</h2>
<p>A browser extension is a plugin for an internet browser that adds additional functionalities and features to it that were not originally there or developed by the developers of the browser itself. Extensions have the ability to modify the user interface and add Web service functionality to a browser.</p>
<p>You can think of a browser extension as a small unit of software, oftentimes referred to as a plug, that can perform various controls as well as filters to change the way a user can visit a web page or view information from a specific web service. </p>
<div>It can take advantage of similar application program interfaces or APIs that JavaScript can on a web page, and extensions even have access to their own set of APIs.</div>
<p>Alongside being used to enhance the functionality of a website, browser extensions can also be used to remove unwanted elements, such as pop-up advertisements and auto-play features in regard to online videos.</p>

<preview>An attempt to crack a password or key through automated trial and error.</preview>
<description>
<div>Brute force attacks involve the use of complex software to flood a system with every potential password or key in order to find the correct value. In theory, such an attack could be used to guess any password or key and gain access to encrypted data. The theoretical amount of time required for a brute force attack to succeed is used as a key measure of the strength of an encryption system.The resources required to conduct a successful brute force attack on a well-secured system are considerable. The amount of time required to guess a password grows exponentially (as opposed to in a linear manner) as the length of the password grows. As such, the bit size of cryptographic keys has gradually increased, from an initial standard of 56 bits up to the modern standard of 128 or 256 bits.Cracking a 256-bit key requires very significant levels of computational power — so much so that serious brute force attacks are generally only possible using supercomputers. </div>
<div>Supercomputers themselves require extremely tightly controlled environmental conditions, and have very high energy requirements. As such, the most advanced brute force attacks are generally thought to be the preserve of state actors. However, modern GPUs and dedicated hardware known as ASICs — both very widely available — are also very well suited to password-cracking tasks, and are accessible to virtually anybody.Some forms of encryption are theoretically impervious to brute force attack. These include one-time pad cryptography. Rather than the use of brute force, illegitimate access to systems using this type of protection generally rely on exploiting human error in a system’s implementation.</div>

<preview>When an asset is traded at a price exceeding that asset's intrinsic value.</preview>
<description>
<div>For many years, commentators have declared that cryptocurrencies (and particularly Bitcoin) are a bubble. By this, they mean that the price of a given coin, or of digital assets generally, is far higher than their “real” value. In fact, many crypto skeptics believe that most cryptocurrencies actually have a real value of zero.Concern over a potential crypto bubble reached its peak around 2018, when the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies soared. At points, the total market cap across all cryptocurrencies was as high as $800 billion back then — despite it being generally considered to be impossible to assign a true, intrinsic value to crypto.Accusations of a crypto bubble are often informed by a belief that the sole purpose of cryptocurrency is speculation. Skeptics point to the low levels of adoption of currencies such as Bitcoin within the “real” economy — for example, it is still extremely difficult to buy a meal in a restaurant or pay for most services using Bitcoin.However, the applications and use cases of cryptocurrency are growing every day, and crypto enthusiasts maintain that the technology and its associated tokens will be proven as having real value. Ethereum is perhaps the prime example of this — providing not only a currency on which to speculate, but also the backbone for an entire ecosystem of decentralized financial and computing services.The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) is thought by many to be proof of crypto's real utility. Proponents of DeFi use blockchain technology to build alternatives to traditional financial products such as loans and insurance, and many believe that this trend points to the real future for decentralized tech.</div>

<preview>A reward offered for the identification of vulnerabilities in software.</preview>
<description>
<div>Bug bounties are offered in the hope that security vulnerabilities will be identified and reported to the owner of software before they can be exploited by a nefarious actor. In crypto, bug bounties are often offered by cryptocurrency businesses such as protocols, exchanges, and wallet operators.Bounty schemes can be thought of as competitions between friendly hackers. The schemes are opened publicly — and the company offering the bug bounty is (theoretically) able to patch any identified vulnerabilities before they become known to bad actors.In most cases, bug bounties are valued according to the severity of the vulnerability identified. According to HackerOne, almost $900,000 in bug bounties were paid out in 2018 alone. The value of individual bounties can be very low — and it is common for companies to pay about $100 as a bounty for the identification of a low-severity vulnerability. However, critical vulnerabilities can sometimes attract bounties of $10,000 or more.Some hackers make significant sums of money identifying bugs. Guido Vranken, a Dutch researcher, identified 12 bugs in the space of a week — and was paid $120,000 by EOS in return.From a software owner’s perspective, bug bounties are considered to be a supplementary security activity, used in addition to other proactive measures. </div>
<p>The most important priority for developers is building secure code and minimizing vulnerabilities before shipping a product. However, even the most careful developers will inevitably miss bugs, and some of these may pose security risks. Bug bounties therefore act as an important second line of defence protecting software owners and users from bad actors.</p>

<title>Bug Exploit</title>

<file>bug-exploit.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A bug exploit is an attack that take advantage of a system's vulnerabilities.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bug Exploit?</h2>
<div>Bug exploits refer to attacks in the form of programs, blocks of data or sets of commands that take advantage of system vulnerabilities in order to gain profit or to expose any particular system. Bug exploits may be done by malicious actors to cause unanticipated behavior on applications or computer networks, enabling them to gain access to such systems or run denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.</div>
<div>According to some publications, there are still many hidden bugs in blockchain and cryptocurrency platforms, which hackers are trying to uncover. There was a recently published report about a Bitcoin bug discovered years ago named the “INVDoS” bug, which, if exploited, would crash Bitcoin nodes. It was discovered by Braydon Fuller back in 2018, who made the information public. It turns out that a hacker could have easily created a malformed Bitcoin transaction that would uncontrollably consume the network’s memory resources.</div>
<div>In the same year, hackers also attacked a cryptocurrency project called Pigeoncoin. They were able to capitalize on Bitcoin’s inflation bug in order to print around $15,000 worth of Pigeoncoins. In doing so, they also had to exploit a bad Bitcoin code. After the discovery of the hack, researchers also saw that there could be more bugs in the Bitcoin network back then that could allow attackers to inflate the supply of Bitcoin above its designated 21 million coin limit. </div>
<div>Bugs like these can be exploited to cause a massive loss of funds through widespread disruption of services and time-sensitive contracts that are implemented throughout affected cryptocurrency markets and exchanges. Therefore, it is important for developers to always subject their projects to extensive security audits and rigid testnet procedures first before they are rolled out to their mainnet for public use.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A person that is optimistic and confident that market prices will increase, this person is also known to be &quot;bullish&quot; about the market or price.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bull?</h2>
<p>Bull, or “bullish,” can refer to: </p>
<p>A. traders or investors who base their strategy on the expectation that an asset will increase in price;</p>
<p>B. market conditions in which most or all assets are steadily rising in price.</p>
<div>A. Traders who employ the strategy of buying an asset low and selling it high — based on the expectation that that asset’s price will steadily increase over time — are traditionally called bulls. The term most likely refers to the way a bull attacks with its horns in an upward motion.</div>
<div>Bulls are optimists who believe that their chosen asset(s)’ fundamental characteristics or the overall market conditions are conducive to a steady increase in price over the long term. As such, they “go long,” i.e. they buy assets at low prices and wait for them to increase in value to be sold down the line.</div>
<div>Bulls are the opposite of bears, who use the strategy of “shorting” an asset based on the expectation of a decrease in price.</div>
<div>B. The term bull market can be used to describe a market in which assets are steadily increasing in price over the long term.</div>
<p>Due to the activities of day traders in any market, asset prices can go up and down multiple times per day. However, if over a long-term period most assets exhibit an aggregate upward trend, that market can be described as bullish.</p>
<div>The cryptocurrency market has displayed a clear bullish dynamic over the years of its existence since January 2009. Bitcoin (BTC), the original and largest cryptocurrency, has gone from $0.003 per coin in March 2010 to about $15,000 in November 2020, despite multiple — sometimes massive — declines along the way.</div>

<title>Bull Market</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bull-market</url>
<file>bull-market.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A bull market in crypto and stock markets refers to a time during which the prices of assets grow dramatically. These markets act as a source of motivation for both investors and purchasers.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bull Market?</h2>
<div>A bull market is characterized by an increase in the value of equities. It occurs when prices of assets in a market climb steadily over time. When describing assets such as crypto, stocks, commodities, and bonds, the phrase &quot;bull market&quot; is widely employed. It may also be utilized for other types of investments, such as real estate. During a bull market, investors acquire a large number of shares with the expectation that their value will rise and that they would be able to profit by selling them later.</div>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>In order to identify bull markets, no specific benchmark or standard is applied. A continuous period of growth in the price of coins in the market is the most significant indicator. Bull markets are characterized by investor growth, optimism, confidence, and other positive characteristics. It is a time when prices of major assets are expected to climb for a lengthy period of time. </p>
<p>Bull markets are difficult to anticipate, but they are easy to spot when prices climb by 20% or more. The most recent bull market in the traditional financial world occurred between 2003 and 2007, but the 2008 financial crisis resulted in another significant drop. </p>
<h2>How Long Does It Take for a Bull Market to End?</h2>
<p>&quot;What goes up must come down,&quot; as the adage goes, and while many buy-and-hold investors expect a bull market will persist indefinitely, the stock market will always undergo phases of expansion and collapse due to the business cycle.</p>
<div>However, it's worth noting that since 1928, there have been just as many bull markets as bear markets, despite the fact that bull markets often run far longer. In fact, from March 2009 to March 2020, the longest bull market in stock market history lasted more than ten years. So, if you're scared that we're about to enter a bear market, don't be. History teaches that bear markets are only transitory.</div>
<h2>Characteristics of a Bull Market</h2>
<p>The following are some of the primary features or aspects of bull markets:</p>
<p>The expansion of the economy; bull markets are frequently associated with flourishing economies.</p>
<p>Investors are more confident, which pushes them to purchase.</p>
<p>Optimism</p>
<p>Unemployment decreases, while corporate profits increase.</p>
<p>Investors' eagerness to provide or acquire assets.</p>
<p>Bull markets may be assessed in terms of increased employment and corporate profits. They are also characterized by a lack of supply and high demand. Bear markets are the polar opposites of bull markets, and both have a huge influence on global financial markets, whether positively or adversely. </p>
<p>Bear markets are connected with price drops and excessive pessimism, whereas bull markets are associated with price increases and confidence in the financial market. Bull markets denote economic and financial expansion, whilst bear markets denote economic decline. Individuals and investors who understand how to take advantage of bull markets are the ones that gain the most.</p>
<h2>Examples of Bull Markets</h2>
<p>From the early twentieth century to the present, here are a few examples of bull markets.</p>
<p>The stock market saw its strongest bull market since World War I in the wake of the war. For many investors, the 1920s were the years of promise and regeneration, with the stock market returning an astonishing average annual gain of 20% (after inflation). During this period, stockbrokers pioneered the notion of margin investing, which required them to pay a small proportion of the overall value and borrow the remainder.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, a digital currency that debuted in 2010 with a value of roughly 8 cents, achieved an all-time high of almost $68,000 in November 2021. The cryptocurrency's quick rise has led to significant speculation from atypical investors. It was first used in an actual transaction to buy a Papa John's pizza. </p>

<title>Bull Run</title>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A bull run (also known as a bull trend) is a period of time in the financial market during which the values of certain assets are constantly rising.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bull Run?</h2>
<div>A brass statue of a bull located on Wall Street, New York City - Robert Nickelsberg/GETTY</div>
<div>A bull run (also known as a bull trend) is a period of time in the financial market during which the values of certain assets are constantly rising. Several market variables, including volatility, demand, and market valuation, have contributed to the rapid increase in prices.</div>
<h2>What Is a Cryptocurrency Bull Run?</h2>
<p>During a crypto bull run, the values of crypto assets constantly rise throughout the course of a market cycle. This is the point in a financial market when investors demonstrate a strong interest in a certain asset, hence increasing the demand for that item.</p>
<p>In the end, the demand for the aforementioned crypto-asset surpasses the supply, indicating an optimistic feeling among investors in the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, when the price of a crypto asset continues to grow on a constant basis, this indicates that the cryptocurrency is experiencing a bull run. The process that drives the values of a crypto asset is intimately tied to the attitudes of the investors who are participating in the process.</p>
<h2>How Long Does a Bull Run Last?</h2>
<p>Although the length of a bull run might vary, in order to be recognized as such, the run must normally last for a prolonged amount of time. It may linger for several months or even years at a time.</p>
<h2>What Triggers a Bull Run in the Cryptocurrency Market?</h2>
<div>The reasons for a bull run might also differ. Prices may rise over a lengthy period of time as a result of variables such as investor optimism and confidence, among other things. However, Bitcoin halving is usually a trigger to these bull runs in a crypto market. </div>
<p>You may check out our Bitcoin halving countdown! </p>
<div>A bull market is a term used to describe a market that is experiencing a bull run. Unlike a bear market, in which asset values tend to decrease for a lengthy period of time, maybe due to pessimism, a bull market is the polar opposite of a bear market.</div>
<p>Similarly, investors can be considered to be &quot;bullish&quot; about an asset or market if they believe it will rise in value, and &quot;bearish&quot; if they believe it will fall in value.</p>
<h2>The Cryptocurrency Bull Run of 2017</h2>
<p>In January of 2017, the Bitcoin price surpassed $1,100, setting a new all-time high. Within a few months, the price rose to approximately $20,000 per coin. That is a 20x increase in less than a year.</p>
<div>The price increase in 2017 happened one year after the Bitcoin halving event, similar to the price increase in 2013. One of the distinguishing characteristics of this period was that, for the first time ever, the general public started to take interest in cryptocurrencies. Mainstream media began to cover articles on Bitcoin. Mostly, this increase in price was due to retail investors joining the market for the first time.</div>
<h2>What Is a Bear Trend?</h2>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule for when a bear trend emerges, but the commonly recognized definition is that it occurs when the market declines by more than 20% from its previous highs. </p>
<p>As long as the bear market continues, investors continue to fear losing money and sell their assets. Many individuals consider bear trends as a chance to earn money because of the low share prices, but this involves finding an appropriate entry point into the market. Finding an entry point may be challenging, and timing the bottom can be tricky as well.</p>

<title>Bull Trap</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bull-trap</url>
<file>bull-trap.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A bull trap occurs when a steadily declining asset appears to reverse and go upward, but soon resumes its downward trend.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Bull Trap?</h2>
<div>Bull traps are false market signals that can take place on an asset, such as a cryptocurrency, that exhibits a strong long-term downward trend. A bull trap is also known as a “whipsaw pattern,” and refers to a false signal where a value of a stock, cryptocurrency, or any other kind of financial asset, displays a sign of recovery or reversal after a downtrend when in reality, the asset is actually set to decline further. In a bull trap, the price of an asset surpasses its previous support levels, enticing traders and long-term investors to open new long positions or purchase more of the asset.</div>
<p>Bull traps are notorious for being deceptive indicators that create dire consequences for players in all markets, which is why they are referred to as “traps.” In fact, they are one of the reasons why traders should be cautious of any sharp reversal of an asset’s price as soon as it finishes a breakout, which is a price movement below a support level. Unfortunately, most retail investors, especially in the crypto space, expect that a breakout will always be followed by a stronger price rally, which isn’t always the case.</p>
<div>Technical analysis is one of the most important tools available to day traders: it relies on analyzing price patterns and finding trading signals on an asset’s price chart in order to try to predict its future movements. One of the most important signals is the breakout above a resistance level, which occurs when the price chart goes above a certain line that has been repeatedly reached but never exceeded before.</div>
<div>This usually leads bullish traders to expect further price increases and go long on the asset. While that assessment is sometimes correct, a bull trap occurs when the signal turns out to be false and the price resumes its downward trend soon after the breakout above the resistance line. Thus, the bulls that have bought the asset get trapped in their trades that were based on the misleading signal.</div>
<div>Bull traps can be avoided by employing extra precautions, such as looking for additional confirmation signals of a prolonged bull run after the initial breakout above the resistance. Breakouts coupled with low trading volume are often a sign of an upcoming bull trap.</div>
<div>Since bull traps occur when bull traders fail to supply the upward trend of an asset following a resistance breakout, low trading volumes during breakouts are good indicators for such. Therefore, in order to prevent being a victim of a bull trap, always consider other indicators, such as trading volume and further price movements, before entering new positions following a price breakout. Most experienced market players refer to this as “confirmations,” whereby a trader further observes the movement of an asset in the next time period before coming up with a decision on whether to enter new positions.</div>

<preview>Cryptocurrency tokens or coins are considered “burned” when they have been purposely and permanently removed from circulation.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Being Burned?</h2>
<div>Cryptocurrency tokens or coins are burned when they are permanently removed from the circulating supply on purpose — as opposed to assets that are lost on accident, like by being unintentionally sent to an address with no owner or via the loss of access to the wallet where they are stored.</div>
<div>Token burning is usually performed by the development team behind a particular cryptocurrency asset. It can be done in several ways, most commonly by sending the coins to a so-called “eater address”: its current balance is publicly visible on the blockchain, but access to its contents is unavailable to anyone.</div>
<p>The practice of burning may involve the project’s developers buying tokens back from the market or burning parts of the supply already available to them.</p>
<p>Burning can be done with different goals in mind, but most often it is used for deflationary purposes: the decrease in the circulating supply tends to drive an asset’s price upward, incentivizing traders and investors to get involved.</p>
<div>Another important use case for token burning is to maintain the price peg of stablecoins (cryptocurrencies whose value corresponds to another asset, like the U.S. dollar): by burning or minting new tokens as necessary, the controlling authority can influence the asset’s price to remain at a near-constant level.</div>

<title>Buy The (F*******) Dip (BTD/BTFD)</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>An enthusiastic exclamation by supporters of a cryptocurrency to buy while prices are at a low point.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Buy The (F*******) Dip?</h2>
<p>Buy The (F*******) Dip is the modus operandi for cryptocurrency bulls; it implies that any dips in the price of your favorite coin should mean only one thing that it’s f******* time to buy more.</p>
<div>Hardcore cryptocurrency bulls come in all shapes and sizes, but they have at least one thing in common: all of them believe that the only destination for their coin of choice is the moon.</div>
<div>If one is to adhere to this way of thinking, it stands to reason that price dips should be considered not as any sort of reflection of a change in the fair value of an asset, but rather as short-lived flash sales to be taken advantage of. Thus, buy the f******* dip became the motto for crypto bulls.</div>
<p>In theory, being committed to buying the f******* dip allows one to leverage the inevitable and frequent, but temporary, drops in the price of an otherwise uptrending asset and dollar-cost-average into owning more.</p>
<p>In practice, far removed from being a coherent trading strategy — owing to the impossibility of pinpoint predictions of every price dip or indeed the nigh-unpredictability of the long-term success of any asset — BTFD is nevertheless a distinct way of life for a crypto bull.</p>
<div>It is the manifestation of that unrelenting optimism which some would say is necessary for the people who are used to waking up on some mornings and finding out that their portfolio has been torpedoed by the uncaring forces of the market, and that 20% of their net worth has been wiped out overnight — a.k.a. crypto investors. Dips are life and BTFD is the secret sauce that separates weak hands from future Lambo owners.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A buy wall is a disproportionately large buy limit order placed on a cryptocurrency exchange.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Buy Wall?</h2>
<div>The vast majority of cryptocurrency exchanges facilitate deals between traders through the use of an order book — a collection of buy and sell orders placed by traders. An individual order is a request to buy or sell a certain amount of cryptocurrency at a certain price. </div>
<p>The exchange then helps buy and sell orders with matching prices to mutually execute — partially or in full depending on the number of coins listed in each of the orders.</p>
<div>A buy wall is a situation where a large limit order has been placed to buy when a cryptocurrency reaches a certain value. This can sometimes be used by traders to create a certain impression in the market, preventing a cryptocurrency from falling below that value, as demand will likely outstrip supply when the order is executed. Often a buy wall is created by a buy limit order for a disproportionately large amount of coins placed by a cryptocurrency whale.</div>
<p>In a way, it “blocks” the price of the asset from going below a certain threshold: there is no rational reason for sellers to offload their assets at a price lower than what the already existing unfulfilled buy wall offers to purchase at. Buy walls can be created for different purposes.</p>
<div>One of them is simply to acquire a large amount of a certain cryptocurrency in cases where the buyer is bullish on it.</div>
<p>Another possible reason for placing a buy wall is price manipulation — a whale who holds a large amount of a certain cryptocurrency might be concerned with the public image of their asset. Consequently, they use their resources to simultaneously buy more coins and prop up the price, making the asset appear more healthy than it actually is.</p>

<preview>Byron Phase is the first phase of Cardano that was released in September 2017.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Byron Phase?</h2>
<p>Byron is the first phase of Cardano, which was released in September 2017.</p>
<p>Byron was all about the basic challenges: sustainability, interoperability, and scalability. This meant creating a stable platform to help develop other projects in the future.</p>
<div>Developers wanted to make sure that it had a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced features. That’s why they focused on the launch of a working mainnet and the Shelley Haskell testnet during this phase.</div>
<div>Byron, named after the famous poet Lord Byron, is the first phase of the Cardano settlement layer. This phase is similar to the bootstrap phase for other public blockchains. During the Byron phase, Cardano used a new Proof-of-Stake algorithm called Ouroboros that took years and extensive academic research to develop. The main idea behind Byron is to create a stable platform that can be used by anyone and everyone to transfer value around the world.</div>
<p>This phase introduces the concept of delegation and voting to the Cardano protocol. Delegation is the process by which a stakeholder can choose someone else to vote for them on their behalf. In this way, you can delegate your stake to a pool operator, who will then add that stake to their own, and submit votes on your behalf.</p>
<div>Byron phase is also where the introduction of side chains happened, and third parties were enabled to create their own blockchains that use Cardano as a consensus and settlement layer. This means they can build their own blockchain while leveraging Cardano’s security.</div>
<div>Finally, Byron would see the introduction of Ouroboros Genesis, which later became the heart of Shelley. Byron represents an important step forward for Cardano and makes it one of the world’s most advanced blockchain platforms.</div>
<p>Cardano's proof-of-stake protocol, called Ouroboros, eliminates the need for specialized hardware and high electricity costs by allowing any stakeholder to participate in the network and receive rewards based on the amount they stake. This means users can participate with smaller amounts than are needed for proof-of-work blockchains, where rewards are distributed based on how much computing power you contribute.</p>
<p>Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire follow Byron phase.</p>
<div>Shelley aims to create a fully decentralized network by transitioning the Cardano blockchain from the control of Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) to the community at large. In this phase, users will be able to delegate their stake in the network and earn rewards. This will allow anyone with ADA tokens to contribute to the stability of the network – even if they don’t have technical expertise.</div>
<p>Goguen enables smart contract functionality on Cardano’s platform. Developers are able to build dApps on its blockchain using Plutus – a purpose-built programming language for financial applications.</p>
<div>Basho phase focuses on enhancing the scalability and interoperability of the platform. The final phase of Cardano's roadmap is Voltaire, which’s all about making Cardano a self-sustaining system.</div>

<preview>Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is the property of a computer system that allows it to reach consensus regardless of the failure of some of its components.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)?</h2>
<div>The Byzantine Generals’ Problem is a famous abstraction that serves to demonstrate one of the key problems in computer science, especially in regard to distributed computer systems (of which cryptocurrency is an example).</div>
<p>Imagine several Byzantine generals camped around an enemy city who communicate with each other only via sending messengers. They have to make a collective decision on whether to attack the city or retreat. However, some of the generals are traitors and may actively work against reaching a consensus. Is it possible to create a system that will ensure that the loyal generals decide on a common plan of action regardless of available knowledge on which generals are the traitors?</p>
<p>A thorough analysis of the problem shows that such an algorithm is possible, but only if more than two-thirds of generals are loyal.</p>
<div>Decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) are in essence distributed computer systems: their networks are composed of individual nodes operated by independent people or organizations that compete to process transactions and add them to the end of the blockchain. With nodes separated geographically and independent of each other or any central authority, it is impossible to reliably know which nodes are supplying faulty information about transactions — either maliciously or by accident.</div>
<div>Byzantine Fault Tolerance refers to the property of a distributed computer system that allows it to overcome this problem and consistently form consensus regardless of the fact that some nodes disagree with the rest, either accidentally or on purpose. This can be achieved via technical solutions, such as Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm, but only if more than two-thirds of nodes remain loyal to the system.</div>

<h2>What Is the Byzantine Generals' Problem?</h2>
<p>The Byzantine Generals' Problem is a thought experiment that deals with a key question of computer science: is it possible to form a consensus in a computer network composed of independent, geographically distributed nodes?</p>
<p>The problem was proposed in 1982 by researchers from the SRI International Research Institute. </p>
<p>It goes as follows: there are a number of Byzantine generals besieging a city. They can only communicate via sending messengers to each other. The generals must agree on a common plan of action: whether to attack the city or retreat. However, some of the generals are traitorous and actively working against the forming of a consensus; their number and identities are unknown.</p>
<p>The question posed by the problem is what decision-making algorithm the generals should use to devise a common plan — regardless of the traitors’ interference — and whether such an algorithm exists at all.</p>
<p>According to the researchers’ own analysis, such a system is indeed feasible, but the number of loyal generals must strictly exceed two-thirds. For example, in a situation with three generals, one of which is traitorous, the loyal ones can never guarantee that they will be able to reach a consensus.</p>
<div>This problem is highly relevant for cryptocurrencies as they are, in essence, distributed computer systems: they are composed of transaction-processing nodes that are independent of each other and any central authority and can only communicate remotely. They are the “generals” that need to reach a consensus about which transactions have taken place and when.</div>
<div>Nodes have the potential to supply faulty data about transactions either by choice or by accident, and their information must be sorted out. Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies solve this problem via technical solutions such as the proof-of-work and proof-of-stake algorithms.</div>

<preview>The Byzantium hard fork was geared towards making Ethereum's smart contracts suitable for usage in the commercial space and to increase the speed of the transactions with an enhancement in th</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Byzantium Fork?</h2>
<div>The Byzantium hard fork was the fifth and a significant upgrade to Ethereum's blockchain. The main purpose behind its creation was aimed at improving the confidentiality, stability, and resilience of Ethereum, in line with the nine EIPs - Ethereum Improvement Protocols.</div>
<div>Fundamental modifications to the software protocol are referred to as &quot;forks&quot; in blockchain development. Soft forks are backward-compatible, thus as long as the majority of nodes update to the new software, the network remains intact. Hard forks, on the other hand, are incompatible with older software versions, so if any node operator does not update to the newest version, the blockchain will divide into two distinct pathways. </div>
<p>The importance of the Byzantium hard fork in the Ethereum ecosystem cannot be underestimated. Its upgrade was implemented back in October 2017 as a part of Metropolis - the 3rd upgrade of ETH's network, as outlined by Ethereum's official roadmap.</p>
<div>Previously, transactions in the Merkle tree were referenced as a root parameter, however, the Byzantium hard fork upgraded this feature by implementing the transaction status communication protocol in consecutive blocks. Doing this allowed Ethereum’s network to overcome the unavailability of parallel processing to speed up chain creations. It also allowed the implementation of linear transaction sequences which means that blocks in the Byzantium hard fork can execute several transactions by simply reporting success or failure. This feature enables the Ethereum network to execute transactions more quickly than before. </div>
<div>The Byzantium development contains four native ethereum contracts that contain the code meant to reduce the power needs for implementing zk-snarks, zero-knowledge encryption, which is rapidly becoming the privacy standard for future cryptocurrency transactions.</div>
<div>Zero-knowledge proofs are computationally demanding calculations that allow systems to show that they have the necessary cryptographic keys without revealing the contents of those keys. The new contracts will ensure that computation-intensive activities are executed directly on the CPU rather than through the Ethereum client, resulting in a reduction in total power consumption.</div>
<div>Block rewards are reduced from five ether per block to three ether per block with the Byzantium reward. This decrease is in accordance with Ethereum's long-term goal of eliminating block rewards in favor of a Proof of Stake mechanism.</div>
<div>The Ethash mechanism, which is a modification of bitcoin's Proof of Work algorithm, is presently being used by Ethereum. A shift to Proof of Stake, which is utilized or adapted in some manner by numerous cryptos, including Dash and Cardano, may help speed up transactions on the Ethereum blockchain once again.</div>
<div>The Byzantium fork aims to pave the way for Ethereum and smart contracts to become more widely used. Following the announcement of the hard fork, the price of the cryptocurrency skyrocketed. Since the Byzantium implementation on the Ethereum network, the total transactions on ETH have surpassed those of BTC. This speaks well for the broad use of smart contracts in the future.</div>

<preview>C++ is an extension of the C programming language that allows cross-platform developments and capabilities.</preview>
<description>
<p>Programming languages are the foundation of all digital technology we see today. There is a huge variety of different languages intended to allow developers to create numerous applications and protocols.</p>
<h2>What Is C++?</h2>
<p>C++ is one of the most popular programming languages today. Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985 as a simple extension of the C programming language, C++ has evolved to become a widely adopted tool for developers.</p>
<div>C++ is intended to carry out software infrastructure development and bring increased performance speeds, flexibility, and efficiency to software developments. The programming language is predominantly utilized in desktop applications, video games, and the management and creation of web search tools and databases. Nowadays, C++ is also heavily used in the creation of blockchains. </div>
<div>Blockchain developers benefit from the rigid structure of the C++ language and use it to create the core functionalities of blockchain protocols. Unfortunately, as a rather old programming language, C++ is one of the hardest to master. While C++ provides a tried and tested tool in a developers’ toolbox, programming enthusiasts who are just starting out might find it hard initially. C++ was developed more than thirty years ago, which means that the syntax and strictly type-based language structure are rather outdated. Some functionalities supported by more modern languages are not supported in C++.</div>
<div>Even so, C++ is one of the most important programming languages in the crypto world. As an object-oriented language, C++ allows developers to benefit from increased efficiency and flexibility in their code. The project that started it all, Bitcoin, is predominantly written in C++. Other prominent blockchain projects written in C++ include EOS and Stellar. Of course, creating a cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain requires the use of more than C++, and developers also turn to popular languages like JavaScript, Python, Solidity, and Go.</div>
<p>Today, more than four million developers globally can code in C++, which only proves how difficult the language is to master. However, C++ capability to handle intensive tasks and carry them out swiftly has made it a go-to choice for blockchain developers. Without C++, we would not have been able to benefit from the introduction of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Blockchain developers are constantly on the lookout for innovation, but C++ remains one of the most widely used languages to date.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Are Call Options?</h2>
<p>Call options are financial contracts that give an option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a stock, bond, commodity or other asset at a specific price, all of which is executed within a specific time-frame. The stock, bond or commodity is the underlying asset for the option. </p>
<p>The specific price is known as the strike price and the time frame in which the sale can be made is called the expiration time. Call options can be purchased for speculation or sold for income purposes. They can also be combined for use in spread or combination strategies. </p>
<p>To take an example, a single call option contract could give an investor the opportunity to buy 50 shares in a company at $10 with an expiration time of four months. Investors can choose between multiple expiration dates and strike prices. As the value of the company's shares rises, the price of the option contract goes up as well. </p>
<p>The call option buyer can hold the contract until the expiration date, or choose to sell the options contract at any point before then at the market price at that point in time. They can also wait for the expiration date and accept delivery of the 50 shares of stock.</p>

<description>
<p>• A candlestick chart is a method of showing historical prices of an asset (e.g. cryptocurrency), giving a good summary of the price’s behavior.</p>
<p>• It is extremely relevant in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading, as candlestick patterns can indicate bullish or bearish reversals.</p>
<p>• Considered a “leading” indicator and not “lagging,” one can get ahead of the trend by acting on leading candlestick patterns before the rest of the traders pile on.</p>
<h2>What Are Candlesticks?</h2>
<p>A candlestick chart is a method of showing prices — namely open, high, low and close — of an asset for a defined period. Candlestick charts are thought to have originated from Japanese rice traders in the 18th century. They are still one of the most popular ways of displaying prices of financial markets.</p>
<p>Note the difference between the “bull” candle (green) and “bear” candle (red). When a candle’s open price is lower than the close, the candle is said to be bullish, while the inverse is true.</p>
<p>A candlestick gives a good summary of how price behaved during the period being charted. All charting tools allow you to change the period of the candlestick chart, from one minute periods to one week or month per candle. This allows the trader to view market sentiment quickly (using colors) and get a good understanding of how prices behaved over a selected duration.</p>
<p>The colors selected are merely one option which the trader can tweak. Most charting platforms default to either green/red or white/black.</p>
<p>As candlesticks illustrate the movement of the asset during the defined period, it can visually indicate bullish or bearish sentiment, especially when candlesticks are viewed as a group. Traders call these candlestick patterns.</p>
<p>Candlestick charting is extremely relevant in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading as a whole. By learning how candlestick patterns can indicate bullish or bearish reversals, you can get ahead of the trend by acting on these leading indicators before the rest of the traders pile on!</p>
<p>As candlesticks utilize raw price data and updates as soon as a period is completed, candlestick patterns are said to be “leading” indicators and not “lagging.” This makes candlestick pattern recognition a must-have in your trading arsenal.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Capital is most commonly defined as the large sum of money you would use to invest.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Capital?</h2>
<p>Capital is essentially wealth in the form of money or other assets that are owned by a person or organization, or simply available for purposes such as starting a company or even investing. Capital is most commonly defined as the large sum of money you would use to invest in order to make more money, and you can use capital to refer to buildings or even machines that are required to produce goods or to make companies a lot more efficient. Capital does not refer to money directly, but what you do with the money in order to get a return. </p>
<p>The capital of a business, however, is the money it has available to pay for its everyday operations and to fund the future growth of the business. In this sphere, there are four main types of capital, such as working capital, debt, equity and trading capital.</p>
<p>Any debt capital is offset by a debt liability on the balance sheet, and the capital structure of a company determines which types of these it ends up using for its business. </p>
<p>Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies, are considered capital assets in a lot of countries, which means that they can potentially be taxed just like stocks are.</p>

<title>Capital Efficiencies</title>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Capital efficiency is the ratio that compares the spending of a company on their growing revenue and how much they are receiving in return in the way of profits.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Capital Efficiencies?</h2>
<div>In the traditional sense, capital efficiency is the ratio that compares the spending of a company on their growing revenue and how much they are receiving in return in the way of profits. This means that if a company is earning $1 for every $1 spent, then it has a 1:1 ratio. The higher the ratio, the more capital efficient a company is and the greater the profit. </div>
<div>Ensuring capital efficiency can help companies look more closely at their processes to see if there are expenses that can be cut without reducing the quality of their operations. For startups, capital efficiency is an important factor to consider. Namely because if a company is spending too much relative to their growth, they may find it hard to fundraise.</div>
<div>In crypto, capital efficiency is considered more effective when using digital assets than fiat because it is usually cheaper to maintain, utilize, process, and send than fiat money, particularly when considering the cost of scaling and security on a long-term and a global scale. </div>
<div>Whether in the form of fiat or crypto, one of the key challenges with ensuring an efficient capital ratio is always requiring a 1:1 backing of an asset. Stablecoins, like Tether, often face challenges where the more capital that goes into the assets from token buyers, the more collateral backing the asset needs. This would be considered capital inefficient. </div>
<p>Innovations coming from blockchain-based finance are changing the way we maintain and improve capital efficiency. Stablecoins that are backed in two ways: collaterally-backed and algorithmically modified, don’t require full collateral backing, like Tether, because only a certain percentage of its supply is required to be collaterally backed. This means the asset requires fewer dollars to act as collateral, so that money can be put to more efficient use. For example, if a $1 peg can be maintained with only 85% of it backed by fiat stablecoins, you can be 15% more capital efficient. </p>
<div>Author: Travis Moore, CTO of Frax </div>
<p>Bio: Travis Moore is an angel investor, programmer, entrepreneur and the CTO of Frax, the world’s first fractional algorithmic stablecoin that is partially backed by collateral and stabilized algorithmically. Frax is open-source and permissionless, bringing a truly trustless, scalable and stable asset to the future of decentralized finance. Moore is also co-founder of the blockchain-based knowledge base, Everipedia. Moore has a triple-major from UCLA in Neuroscience, Biochemistry, and Molecular, Cell, &amp; Developmental Biology. His passions are artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, which he believes are the two industries that will impact the world the most in the coming decade.</p>

<description>
<p>Capital funding is the money provided in the form of debt or equity to operate a company. Traditionally, the capital structure of a company could be determined by reviewing its liabilities and shareholder equity listed on the company’s balance sheet. However, with the introduction of tokens and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), a company or organization may not need traditional capital funds but can instead issue tokens to operate in the long run. It is important to note that global regulators have clearly stated that tokens are not securities which means they lack the rights and protection under the securities act.</p>
<p>A company can raise capital funds through stock issuance, debt issuance or token issuance.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Capitulation is the process of selling assets or cryptocurrencies at a significant loss because you have lost hope or belief that it will ever increase in price.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Capitulation?</h2>
<p>Capitulation is the conscious decision to sell all or part of your assets at a loss because the price has dropped so much you don't believe it can go back up. In the traditional sense of the word, capitulation refers to the process of surrendering power, however in finance and trading, this term gets a rather different meaning.</p>
<div>Both traditional trading on stock exchanges, for example, and cryptocurrency trading comes with a significant amount of risk. Prices fall and rise, however, traders rarely have guarantees which direction their investment will take. Considering this, the scenario where your investment portfolio loses half of its value is not to be disrregarded.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrency trading is even more riskier, according to some, because of the decentralized nature of the market. A market that is not regulated by a central governing body is much more susceptible to manipulation or huge influences, and therefore, changes in the valuations of crypto tokens can be significant. Of course, most cryptocurrencies have an intrinsic value that cannot be dismissed with an easy hand. However, since Bitcoin launched in 2009, we have seen not one and two crypto winters and bear markets.</div>
<p>Considering this high volatility in the cryptocurrency sector, capitulation is way more likely to occur with crypto traders. Unfortunately, sometimes crypto tokens loose value quickly, and investors find it hard to believe that they will be able to wait out the drop, and still sell at a profit. Once a decision is made that an asset should be sold at a loss, regardless of how much its value dropped, this is called capitulation.</p>
<p>The past two years, 2020, and 2021 have been a rollercoster of emotions for crypto traders, especially ones investing in Bitcoin. While the token hit an all time high in April 2021, its price quickly started falling only a couple of weeks after that. Because of the huge shift on the market, and Bitcoin’s underperformance, many investors decided to sell a poriton, or all of their holdings in Bitcoin at a loss. This mass sellout of Bitocin tokens led to a further drop in the price for one BTC. Unfortunately, when capitulation happens on a more global level, it can trigger further crashes in the price of the asset that’s being sold.  </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Casascius Coin?</h2>
<p>A Casascius coin is a physical Bitcoin unit that comes in various designs, sizes and types, typically owned by niche collectors. </p>
<p>Invented by Mike Caldwell in 2011, Casascius coins are some of the first known-examples of so-called “physical bitcoins” — that is, BTC stored within a physical structure, such as a coin or bar. Mike Caldwell continued producing Casascius coins until 2013, but shut down the operation due to the intervention of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) who believed the activity may be considered money transmitting, and hence require a license. </p>
<p>Over the course of his three-year project, Mike minted and added value to a total of 27,938 Casascius coins and bars with an estimated worth of 91,262.8 BTC. Due to their limited number, Casascius coins are considered to be an attractive investment opportunity, and typically command a premium over their “peel value” — that is, the sum total of the cryptocurrency they contain. </p>
<p>Not all Casascius coins contain actual BTC. They can come either loaded or unloaded, with unloaded coins lacking the private key that is usually used to redeem any associated bitcoin. </p>
<p>Since the creation of Casascius coins, a variety of other types of physical Bitcoin have emerged under various names, some of which include: Alitin Mint, Titan Bitcoin, Cryptmint coins, Antana coins, Ravenbit Satoshi coin, CoinedBits and Lealana coins. </p>

<preview>Cash is the most liquid form of money: physical coins and banknotes in the most narrow sense of the term.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Cash?</h2>
<p>In the everyday meaning of the word, cash is the physical form of currency: coins and banknotes that can be carried on person and used to pay for goods and services immediately. </p>
<p>However, in different contexts, the meaning of cash can expand to include bank accounts and marketable securities such as government bonds. Even less narrowly, in finance, cash includes all currency equivalents that can be liquidated immediately or near-immediately.</p>
<p>Historically, gold and silver coins were for a long time an almost exclusive means of payment across the globe: the scarcity of precious metals ensured their value and their uniformity allowed for simpler accounting.</p>
<div>The emergence of paper money from seventh century CE onwards has led to the gradual detachment of the value of cash from the value of the material it is made of and the ultimate appearance of fiat currencies — like the U.S. dollar and the euro. These are established as money by the decision of the government and have no intrinsic value.</div>
<p>From the 1980s on, societies across the globe have been increasingly moving away from cash, replacing it with debit and credit cards and, more recently, mobile payments. As of November 2020, the global volume of cash comprises roughly $6.6 trillion — just a fraction of $630 trillion to $1.2 quadrillion, which is the total volume of all types of money.</p>

<title>Casper (Ethereum)</title>

<file>casper-ethereum.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Casper is a project designed to implement PoS into the Ethereum network.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Casper (Ethereum)?</h2>
<div>The existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism for Ethereum is being replaced by an improved version of Proof-of-Stake (PoS).</div>
<p>The Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism relies on computational processing power and is plagued by several shortcomings. The Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, conversely, relies on token-holder deposits to achieve consensus.</p>
<h2>What Is the Difference Between PoW and PoS?</h2>
<p>Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) are the most widely used consensus mechanisms.</p>
<div>The main idea behind Proof-of-Work (PoW) is that miners compete to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. The winner who solves the puzzle first is allowed to create a new block on the blockchain and receive a reward.</div>
<p>In contrast, in Proof of Stake (PoS), instead of miners competing against each other, they are required to lock up some of their coins as stakes. A validator is chosen at random to validate the block depending on his stake weight (how many coins he has staked).</p>
<h2>The Casper Protocol Will Be Implemented in Two Phases</h2>
<div>Phase 0: Beacon Chain. This phase will introduce the Proof of Stake concept to the Ethereum blockchain. Beacon Chain will be a new blockchain that will run in parallel to the current Ethereum blockchain. It will be used to manage and coordinate validators without executing smart contracts or having accounts.</div>
<div>Phase 1: Sharding. This phase will provide massive scalability by dividing the Ethereum network into multiple shards, each capable of processing transactions in parallel. At the moment, the Ethereum network can only process about 15 transactions per second (TPS). Sharding would enable it to process thousands of TPS if not more.</div>
<div>Ethereum Casper is a protocol that combines Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. The Proof of Work part is the same as what we have now, using the Ethash algorithm. The Proof of Stake part is a new consensus mechanism called &quot;Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget&quot; (FFG).</div>
<p>The goal of Casper FFG is to eventually replace proof-of-work mining with proof-of-stake. This means that people who currently use hardware to mine Ethereum would be able to participate in validating and securing the network without having to buy expensive hardware.</p>
<h2>Advantages That Casper Offers to Ethereum</h2>
<p>Proof of Stake (PoS) systems don't require as much effort to validate transactions, meaning miners don't need high-powered hardware or spend as much on electricity. This means lower costs and less environmental impact — something that's especially important now that Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than many countries.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work requires every transaction to be validated by every node in the network before it can be completed. It uses a different validation method which would allow Casper to process more transactions per second, leading to faster and cheaper transactions overall.</p>
<p>The big benefit of moving to proof-of-stake is that it will be more energy-efficient. In the long run, this will allow the amount of Ether in circulation to grow at a controlled and sustainable rate.</p>
<p>Casper protocol’s ultimate objective is transforming Ethereum to its version 2.0, which is also given the name of “Serenity.” Ethereum 2.0 aims to be faster, more efficient, and highly scalable. </p>

<description>
<h2>Who Is Cathie Wood?</h2>
<div>Catherine ‘Cathie’ Wood founded ARK Invest in 2014 after working at other investing firms and hoped to bundle active stock portfolios in an ETF structure. Over the last five years, her flagship $23 billion (assets) Ark Innovation Fund has returned over 45 percent yearly on average. </div>
<div>Wood studied economics at the University of Southern California under Art Laffer, the creator of the Laffer Curve, which theories the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue. Wood is one of Elon Musk's most ardent supporters. She believes the electric car firm will be valued at over $3 trillion in the future.</div>
<div>Before 2020, many people didn't know Cathie Wood, but it didn't take long for her to become a legendary investor in the stock markets. Despite enduring some instabilities for the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT:ARKK) and other ARK Invest exchange-traded funds last year, numerous investors still see Wood as an inspiration with talent toward the developments which will define high-growth funds to invest for years to come.</div>
<div>Cathie Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the best-performing U.S. equities fund last year, has been an outspoken supporter of Bitcoin (BTC). When China banned Bitcoin in June, many crypto analysts saw it as a bad thing for the cryptocurrency world, however, Wood saw it as a benefitting move in the long run. Furthermore, when Bitcoin was criticized for its environmental effect by Elon Musk, the owner of SpaceX and Tesla, with concerns over bitcoin mining's energy usage, Wood reaffirmed her support for bitcoin as &quot;environmentally conscientious.&quot;</div>
<div>Wood stated that bitcoin is transparent and allows for economic empowerment throughout the world. She further added that when mining shifts to renewable energy, bitcoin will be a net benefit to the planet and the environment.</div>
<div>Wood's company ARK Invest provides strategies for investing in cryptocurrencies. ARK Invest believes that cryptocurrencies regulated by open-source networks will usher in a new era of monetary systems and value storage and transfer methods. The investment manager anticipates that the characteristics like value and market share of cryptocurrencies will be &quot;power-law distributed,&quot; indicating that just a few cryptocurrencies would grab the major share of the market.</div>
<div>According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.</div>
<p>Wood, a longtime bitcoin supporter, has been buying bitcoin proxies from companies, like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, as the innovative investor now wants to be the owner of the asset.</p>
<p>According to the SEC filing, the ETF's investing aim is to track bitcoin's performance. If the SEC approves the fund, it will trade under the ticker symbol &quot;ARKB.&quot; The ETF will be launched by Ark Invest in collaboration with 21Shares.</p>

<preview>Censorship is the act of altering, suppressing, or prohibiting speech or writing that is considered detrimental to the general public.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Censorship?</h2>
<div>Censorship is a process of prohibiting any form of media/tool that can be controlled by authorities. It can be witnessed both on a government level and in private entities. Self-censorship occurs when a person, such as an author or an artist, participates in censorship of their works or statements. It occurs for a variety of purposes, the most common ones include: </div>
<p>In general, censorship can be imposed on any form of media, including art performances and works, the press, television, and the Internet.</p>
<div>The whole concept of decentralization that cryptocurrencies brought into this world is a form of resistance against financial censorship, wherein world governments and powerful institutions control the flow of money.</div>
<div>One of the key value propositions of Bitcoin (BTC) is its resilience to censorship. No nation/state, company, and third-party service have control over the people who transact or keep their money on the blockchain network, according to the concept. Censorship resistance guarantees that the network's laws are established in advance and cannot be changed retrospectively to suit a certain purpose.</div>
<div>Due to the resistance against censorship, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have faced a complete ban on many fronts. The biggest example would be China's crackdown on cryptocurrencies which crashed the crypto markets in May 2021. China banned the crypto mining operations in its country citing reasons such as the lack of real support value and the easier manipulation that can occur in cryptocurrencies, resulting in huge losses for crypto investors. This ban had a huge impact as Bitcoin fell from its all-time-high of roughly around $65,000 to somewhere around $28,000. However, the market turned bullish in the later months, and in August 2021 Bitcoin surpassed $50,000 once again.</div>
<div>Another great example of censorship in the tech world would be Google. The tech giant banned the use of 'Bitcoin' and other cryptocurrency keywords to be used in the advertisements that run on its platform. However, in a recent turn of events, Google is now allowing several crypto service providers within the U.S to run their ads with a strict set of restrictions, which is also a form of censorship. Even now, Google doesn't allow any advertisement on its platform that relates to DeFi trading protocols and initial coin offerings (ICOs).</div>
<div>It is also worth noting that while Google does allow crypto applications on the Google Play Store, like Binance, STEX, CoinMarketCap, and others, it, however, continues to ban crypto mining and trading applications that do not fulfill its ‘standards’.</div>
<div>The future of cryptocurrencies is not affected by censorship imposed by regulatory bodies and private entities as the whole concept promotes the idea of censorship resistance itself.</div>

<div>A censorship-resistant blockchain ensures that all transactions within a network are secured from potential meddling, making it immutable. Once a transaction is completed, it gets distributed to all nodes within the network and becomes quasi-impossible to change. This property was first introduced by Bitcoin but has since been adopted by a wide array of crypto projects. </div>
<div>Interestingly, censorship resistance is particularly useful to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications since traditional finance products are full of barriers to entry, with various intermediaries blocking access to certain types of people and intervening with transactions. DeFi offers a censorship-resistant version of traditional finance, albeit with higher risks and higher yields. </div>
<div>Many proponents view blockchains as a way to attain freedom from the oppression of current systems. In recent years, there has been an advocacy for the implementation of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in journalism. Many journalists face censorship from powerful organizations and social media companies, which is why decentralized social networks like Steem, Subsocial and many others have been popping up to offer solutions.</div>
<div>Censoring a blockchain is extremely difficult, but not impossible. This scenario might happen via a 51% attack, but the effects would only be temporary as maintaining such attacks is costly, which makes it a major deterrent for attackers.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Central Bank?</h2>
<p>A central bank is a financial institution that has privileged control over both the creation and distribution of money and credit for a nation or economic union of nations.</p>
<p>In contemporary economies, the central bank is responsible for the formulation and transmission of monetary policy, as well as for the regulation of member banks.</p>
<p>The central bank is therefore responsible for overseeing and steering a country’s monetary system and policies by, among other things, regulating the money supply and setting interest rates. </p>
<p>Central banks can either ease or tighten a country’s money supply, thereby determining the cost and availability of credit. This control of the national money supply lies in issuing fiat currency and setting interest rates on loans and bonds. Raising or lowering interest rates can be intended to spur or balance growth, industrial activity and customer spending. All these decisions are taken in line with specific goals for the evolution of the national economy. </p>
<p>Central banks also hold a country’s foreign exchange reserves, which can be used to back liabilities or shape monetary policy. In times of financial crisis, a central bank can also be a lender of last resort to any troubled financial institution or the government. </p>
<p>Central banks regulate member banks through measures such as capital and reserve requirements, or required policies, such as deposit guarantees.</p>

<title>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency</url>
<file>central-bank-digital-currency.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>CBDCs are digital currencies issued by a central bank whose status as legal tender depends on government regulation or law.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Central Bank Digital Currencies?</h2>
<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are fiat currencies that exist in a digital form and are issued by central banks.</p>
<div>CBDCs remain fully within the orbit of the traditional, intermediated financial system of fiat currencies, which are backed by trust in the currency's issuer: a national central bank and ultimately, the sovereign government or political authority behind it.</div>
<div>They are a concept inspired by — but different from — true cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). CBDCs are fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro or the Japanese yen, as they are issued by central banks of their respective nations in a digital form.</div>
<h2>Worldwide Adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) </h2>
<p>As of March 2022, there are only a few numbers of publicly-available CBDCs, such as in The Bahamas, followed by Nigeria and the Eastern Caribbean Union. Mostly, they only exist in the form of proof-of-concept projects, like the digital currency/electronic payments (DCEP) of the People’s Bank of China, or the Uruguayan e-peso. </p>
<div>Nevertheless, with Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs in 2021, the world of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins became well sought-after which is when governments realized they need to come up with an alternative too.  This explains that, as of June 2022, over 105 countries are considering issuing a CBDC according to the Atlantic Council. You can track the status of a country’s CBDC here.</div>
<h2>CBDCs vs Fiat currencies</h2>
<div>CBDCs may or may not employ a distributed database like the blockchain; however, they cannot be considered true cryptocurrencies. They are not decentralized due to the fact that their issuing central banks maintain complete control over production and distribution — in the same way as they do with traditional fiat currencies. Their value is also not backed by anything other than the public’s trust in the issuer.</div>
<p>CBDCs do, however, offer several advantages over fiat money, such as the ability to send them directly to other parties without having to rely on third-party payment processors. CBDCs also offer more control by the government over its circulation, resulting in a more efficient implementation of monetary policy.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve also published a paper highlighting the benefits of a CBDC. One of the benefits highlighted the potential of CBDCs to replace the existing cross-border payments systems, as it is a significantly cheaper and faster alternative. However, to achieve so, a high level of global cooperation would be required. The paper also stated that CBDCs can help decrease the use of paper money that is free of credit and liquidity risk.</p>
<p>CBDCs are issued by a competent monetary authority of a country and are regulated by the same. This form of currency is not the same as cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>How Are Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) Designed?</h2>
<p>Account-based and token-based CBDCs are the two frequently-used design formats. Central banks from all around the world have to keep certain features of the CBDCs in mind, including access, privacy and the method of distribution. This is because CBDCs are still completely within the orbit of traditional currencies which is why they must be easily accessible by all the users and should not be too complex as it could make it quite difficult for the users to transact.</p>
<div>Token-based CBDCs allow universal access to all the users at the cost of higher law-enforcement measures. The token-based technology works in a similar way to that of the blockchain as it functions using the distributed ledger technology to confirm the chain of ownership to validate transactions. It may also result in a high risk of end-users losing keys or tokens held in a non-custodial wallet. </div>
<p>As the name suggests, account-based CBDCs rely on the identity of the bank account holders. This is why account-based CBDCs require digital identification to access an account. This is a method that is not used as often due to the fact that it still relies on a constant relationship with a bank. When a transaction is carried out, each payment is processed separately by banks by debiting the sender's CBDC account and crediting the receiver’s account. The bank accounts help in verifying the identities of both parties in a transaction which requires advanced systems to uniquely verify each user on the payment system.</p>
<div>The responsibility of CBDC’s operations and circulation lies with the country's monetary authority or central bank. In its simplest terms, unlike cryptocurrencies, a CBDC is a government-backed currency. However, countries like El Salvador are making waves by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. Unlike Bitcoin, which is a decentralized cryptocurrency, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is centralized and regulated. They are officially used as a medium of exchange in countries along with official currencies. </div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A central ledger is a physical book or a computer file used to record transactions in a centralized manner.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Central Ledger?</h2>
<div>Central ledgers are physical books or digital files used by individuals or organizations to record and total economic transactions in a centralized manner — as opposed to decentralized ledgers used in distributed ledger technology (DLT).</div>
<p>Ledgers have been used since the earliest days of civilization to record and confirm the ownership of assets and the legal identity of individuals, as well as their legal status and political rights.</p>
<p>The popularization of double-entry bookkeeping in 16th century Italy has revolutionized the use of ledgers in banking and accounting, which played a crucial role in expanding the capitalist economic system, according to some experts. The technique of recording every entry to an account along with a corresponding and opposite entry in a different account has significantly improved the accuracy of ledger records.</p>
<p>Traditionally, a central ledger is managed by the accounting department of a business to record all economic activity that the company is involved in for the purpose of financial analysis, tax reporting and more. Although efficient, this approach has disadvantages: relying on a central authority to manage all bookkeeping makes the ledger vulnerable to any mistakes made by that authority — either deliberate or accidental. </p>
<div>Distributed ledger technology is a more recent evolution of the concept of ledgers that aims to decentralize the process of bookkeeping and remove the central authority which acts as a single point of failure. Bitcoin’s (BTC) blockchain is one of the most successful examples of a decentralized ledger.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A central processing unit (CPU) is the part of a computer that is in charge of interpreting and executing programs and coordinating the work of all other components.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Central Processing Unit (CPU)?</h2>
<p>A central processing unit, also known as a processor or CPU, acts as the “brains” of the computer — it is the component that performs the arithmetic, logic and control operations specified in any program. The concept of a CPU has been in use in computer science since as early as the 1950s.</p>
<p>Most modern CPUs are microchips containing millions of microscopic transistors. Each of those transistors can turn on and off, representing the ones and zeroes of the binary system. By working in combination, these transistors allow even smartphone CPUs to perform billions of calculations per second.</p>
<div>In addition to performing its own operations, a CPU also directs the work of other components of a computer: the random-access memory (RAM), the graphical processing unit (GPU) and others.</div>
<p>One of the primary characteristics defining the computational power of a CPU is its clock speed, usually measured in gigahertz (GHz), which very roughly corresponds to the number of calculations a CPU can perform per second.</p>
<div>The ability of CPUs to perform large numbers of computations every second has resulted in their use for cryptocurrency mining — which relies on the calculation of millions of hash functions in order to find a random output whose value will be below a given target — in the early years of the crypto industry.</div>
<div>However, as the industry grew and the competition between miners became more fierce, the computational power of CPUs became insufficient. Ultimately, they got displaced in favor of more economically feasible tools, such as GPUs and the highly specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).</div>

<title>Centralized</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized</url>
<file>centralized.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A centralized organizational structure is one in which a single node or a small number of them are in control of an entire network.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Does Being Centralized Mean?</h2>
<p>Centralized structures rely on a central point of authority to make decisions and maintain the operation of the entire system.</p>
<p>Some examples of a centralized organization are a company that is controlled from the top-down by a single CEO or a small number of senior managers, or a mobile payments app that allows users to send money to each other but retains complete control over the processing of transactions.</p>
<div>Centralized structures are the opposite of decentralized ones. Centralized and decentralized structures are the two major types of organizational structure. Each type offers its own advantages and disadvantages.</div>
<p>Centralized organizations maintain a clear chain of command and a focused vision, which tends to lead to a quick and efficient execution of decisions and leaves less room for error. They are also usually more cost-effective owing to the clear separation of responsibilities between different actors.</p>
<p>However, centralized organizational structures are not without downsides, most of which result naturally from their reliance on a central point of authority, which can sometimes prove to be the single point of failure.</p>
<p>Lacking in redundancy, which is an organic feature of decentralized systems, centralized structures are excessively vulnerable to any malfunctions in their governing authority, regardless of whether those are caused by malice, incompetence or are simply accidental.</p>
<div>If a bank’s payment system goes down for an extended period of time, its customers are left unable to conduct any transactions, whereas decentralized networks like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) remain fully operational even when one or more nodes stop working.</div>

<title>Centralized Exchange (CEX)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/centralized-exchange-cex</url>
<file>centralized-exchange-cex.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that is operated by a company that owns it in a centralized manner.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Centralized Exchanges?</h2>
<div>Centralized exchanges most commonly facilitate trades between users by maintaining an order book: a collection of buy and sell orders posted by individual traders. Orders are requests to buy or sell a certain amount of a specific cryptocurrency at a certain price. CEXs aggregate orders from their users and then use special software to match and execute the corresponding buy and sell orders.</div>
<div>CEX users do not actually exchange crypto or fiat currencies with each other. Instead, when they deposit their funds onto an exchange, the latter takes over the custody of those assets and issues a corresponding amount of IOUs to the trader. The exchange tracks every user’s IOUs internally as they change hands in trades and only converts them into actual currency at the moment of withdrawal of funds.</div>
<p>As of 2020, CEXs are the most widespread mode of operation for cryptocurrency exchanges. The speed and cost-efficiency of processing transactions by a single point of authority make them a convenient venue for day traders and crypto investors to purchase and sell crypto.</p>
<div>The reliance of CEXs on a central entity does lead to some disadvantages, however. Centralized exchanges do not reveal their internal operations to the users, leading to a lack of transparency that enables malicious practices such as wash trading and price manipulation.</div>
<div>The fact that they hold custody over users’ assets makes a centralized exchange a lucrative target for potential attackers both from outside and from within the organization: in 2019, over $292 million worth of customer funds have been lost in just the 12 largest CEX hacks.</div>
<p>Technical issues or coordinated attacks can lead to significant downtime of CEX services, leading to lost trade opportunities for their customers. Finally, centralized exchanges represent an easy target for government censorship, allowing regulators to freeze and/or seize user funds and force the exchanges’ parent companies to reveal their customers’ personal information.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Centre (Consortium)? </h2>
<div>USD Coin is managed by a consortium called Centre, which is backed by Circle and Coinbase. It’s supposed to be “price-stable” as its value will be pegged to the US dollar. This is different from Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies that are free-floating.  </div>
<div>Centre is a network that is powered by price-stable crypto assets, creating better conditions for global money transfer and foreign exchange. This network allows for the easy transfer of money between people, businesses, and financial institutions all over the world. It is a governed network through which stablecoins are minted, traded, and transferred. Businesses can use its fast and low-cost token-based transactions to easily tap into markets around the globe, without having to make local currency deposits or open numerous bank accounts.</div>
<div>Leveraging blockchain technology, the platform enables fast digital transfers between parties and improves efficiencies in settlement processes among financial institutions. The governance structure gives community members the power to govern their currency while establishing fair rules and bringing new players into the ecosystem.</div>
<div>Stablecoins like USDC are designed for the use case of price stability — for example, as a reliable store of value or unit of account. They are also useful as a medium of exchange when you want to transact in digital, borderless payments without having to accept the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</div>
<p>Both Coinbase and Circle have strong reputations in the crypto-verse, with Coinbase being one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States and Circle being a popular stablecoin developer. The latter also happens to be part of Goldman Sachs, which gives the USD Coin a great deal of legitimacy.</p>

<title>Certificate of Deposit (CD)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/certificate-of-deposit-cd</url>
<file>certificate-of-deposit-cd.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A certificate of deposit (CD) is a financial product allowing customers to earn an interest rate premium after making a deposit.</preview>
<description>
<p>In our modern financial world, credits are an important tool that allows customers to purchase goods and services without the necessary capital in hand. </p>
<p>However, there’s also the reverse situation, when customers have gathered up capital, and want to start earning from it. A certificate of deposit (CD) is one of the many ways to do that.</p>
<p>A CD is usually issued by banks and other financial institutions when a client makes a substantial deposit. This deposit is then left at the hands of the institution to use, while the customer receives a percentage-based interest rate premium. Certificates of deposit can have varying terms and conditions, depending on the issuing institution, as well as on the amount the customer is ready to deposit. Even today, with the serious diversification we’re seeing in the financial and investment world, CDs remain one of the more popular ways to earn passive income from your savings.</p>
<div>In cryptocurrency, the certificate of deposit mechanism has yet to be explored extensively. While the concept is very appealing, there aren’t many crypto projects that have yet ventured into the world of CDs. </div>
<div>One of the more recognizable CD tokens is REX. This was the first attempt to combine the popular traditional finance interest mechanic with blockchain technology. REX is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token, or a BEP-20 token, which means it can be used in a wide variety of decentralized finance applications built on BSC. It launched in mid-2021 and ultimately is one of the more popular CD options on the blockchain. </div>
<p>Other tokens like HEX have also joined the ecosystem. However, REX remains a leader in the CD sector on BSC. The main difference here is that HEX is Ethereum-based, which usually means higher gas fees for users. </p>
<p>The way CDs work in the cryptocurrency world is very similar to their operation in traditional finance. Crypto investors lock up a portion of their token holdings, receiving a fixed or flexible interest rate based on that deposit. </p>
<p>However, with cryptocurrency-based CDs, there is an important clarification to be made. Certificates of deposit in traditional finance are based on deposits in fiat currencies, which rarely see major fluctuations in their price. However, with cryptocurrencies, prices can experience major spikes and corrections. This means that the return rate on any crypto-backed CD fluctuates in a correlation with the price movement of the given token. </p>
<p>Of course, price changes may be in favor of investors if the price for their CD tokens is increasing. However, it is important to note that certificates of deposit in crypto carry a larger amount of risk compared to their traditional finance counterparts. </p>

<title>Chain Reorganization</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/chain-reorganization</url>
<file>chain-reorganization.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Chain reorganization is a process in blockchain technology that allows node operators to replace blocks and adopt new ones, in order to create new, longer chains of data.</preview>
<description>
<div>Blockchain technology is a complex combination of processes which ensure that data is stored and distributed among node operators securely. Every active copy of the distributed ledger or blockchain is considered a node. Nodes have a responsibility to keep their copies of the blockchain updated, in order to be able to successfully verify transactions — this is where chain reorganization plays a vital part. </div>
<div>Each blockchain consists of a long string of blocks, connected in a distributed ledger. Each block, in turn, is a collection of hundreds and thousands of processed transactions. </div>
<p>However, as the blockchain develops, more and more transactions are completed, making the string of blocks larger. Chain reorganization is the process during which a node will deactivate blocks in its old longest chain, in order to add the latest blocks, that are the building elements of the new longest chain.</p>
<div>Chain reorganization usually happens in busier blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, where nodes might happen to build a new block at exactly the same time, and at the same position. If this occurs, when the two nodes engage in updating their copy of the ledger, the node that has produced a shorter follow-up chain undertakes chain reorganization. In essence, chain reorganization allows all node operators to have the same copy of the distributed ledger.</div>
<p>Considering this, chain reorganization is a central process that facilitates the successful operation of blockchains. If chain reorganization was not possible, the concept of a unified ledger existing with each node would have been impossible. </p>
<div>Even so, there are analysts saying that chain reorganization can potentially leave users with a lot of rejected transactions. In theory, this is possible if your transactions are recorded in the orphan block that is rejected. However, this rarely happens. More often than not, the transactions recorded in the orphan block, and the block that brings in the new longest chain are the same. </div>
<p>As a relatively straightforward process, chain reorganization is executed in seconds and does not slow down the processing times for new transactions. This essential mechanism allows blockchain technology to be so versatile in its applications and use cases. Thanks to chain reorganization, all copies of the ledger saved across the different nodes are identical, thus ensuring the validity of all recorded transactions. </p>

<title>Chain Split</title>

<file>chain-split.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Chain splits are another term used to describe cryptocurrency forks — the separation of a single original coin into several independently managed projects.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Chain Split?</h2>
<div>Software forks occur when developers copy the codebase of an already existing project and begin their own independent development based on it. This results in the separation of one or more distinct projects from the original, “parent” project.</div>
<div>Chain splits, or cryptocurrency forks, are coins whose codebase has been copied from another, older cryptocurrency and whose further development continues independently of the direction taken by the parent coin.</div>
<div>Due to the fact that a lot of cryptocurrencies, especially in the earlier years of the industry, were released as open-source projects, it is often exceptionally easy to fork a project, even for a developer lacking the skills to create their own coin from scratch. As a result, some of the largest cryptocurrencies today are forks or even forks of forks of different parent projects.</div>
<div>Chain splits can occur due to a large number of diverse reasons. Sometimes developers believe that a cryptocurrency is good in most regards but could benefit from certain technical adjustments: such was the case of Litecoin (LTC), which split from Bitcoin (BTC) in order to allow for faster block generation time, increased total supply of coins and a different hashing algorithm.</div>
<div>At other times, chain splits may be caused by ideological differences, like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which was forked from Bitcoin over differing opinions on how to scale the coin for a larger user base. Another example is Ethereum Classic (ETC), which split from Ethereum (ETH) over an argument about whether cryptocurrency developers should be able to amend data recorded on the blockchain in order to return stolen coins to their original owners.</div>
<div>Sometimes a crypto fork can be a simple joke, like the Dogecoin (DOGE), a fork of Litecoin that was inspired by an internet meme and at one point reached a market capitalization in excess of $2 billion.</div>

<title>Change</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/change</url>
<file>change.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Change — a concept relevant to cryptocurrencies that use the UTXO model — is the number of coins sent back to a user after they use their unspent outputs to initiate a transaction.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Change?</h2>
<div>Bitcoin (BTC) and many other cryptocurrencies are based on the so-called unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) model. </div>
<div>In the UTXO model, transactions are made up of inputs and outputs: when a user wants to send coins to someone, they feed inputs to the network. The latter, after processing the transaction, produces outputs that can be later used as inputs for new transactions.</div>
<div>Perhaps counterintuitively, the balance of a Bitcoin address is not actually a certain number of coins that are stored on it, but rather a collection of yet-unspent outputs from previous transactions. When you send Bitcoin, you can only send them in a whole output, and the rest are sent back as change.</div>
<p>As an example: user A has a Bitcoin address with a single unspent output of 0.5 BTC and wants to send 0.3 BTC to user B. They cannot split their UTXO of 0.5 coins; instead, they have to send the full amount to the network as the sole input of the new transaction.</p>
<div>The network then destroys that input and creates three new outputs that add up to the same amount: 0.3 BTC to be sent to user B, a certain small fee to be sent to the miner who helps process the transaction and 0.2 BTC, minus the miner fee, to be sent back to user A.</div>
<div>In this example, the last output of ~0.2 BTC is the change that user A receives as a new UTXO which can be later used as an input to initiate a new transaction.</div>

<title>Change Address</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/change-address</url>
<file>change-address.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>In cryptocurrencies, a change address is where the change from a transaction is temporarily stored before it is returned to the sender wallet.</preview>
<description>
<div>Just like with fiat money, when transacting in cryptocurrencies, users don’t always have the exact amount to send. This means that sometimes you send more funds than the transaction requires. In these cases, the remainder of your assets is returned to a change wallet and then refunded to your original wallet address. </div>
<div>Let’s look at an example. If you have a $50 bill and have to pay $40 for your purchase, your change will be $10. The same can happen with cryptocurrencies. Transactions on the blockchain always have an input and an output. For example, if you go on an exchange and purchase 1 ETH with fiat, the input will be the fiat money, the output will be 1 ETH. However, if you are looking to send 1 ETH to a crypto wallet, the case is not as straightforward. </div>
<p>Sometimes, in cryptocurrency transactions, inputs cannot be precisely calculated to the exact amount requested by the transaction. In such cases, the sender address sends more funds than requested by the transaction. However, the difference between the requested amount and the amount stored in the input is what is called change. This change is temporarily stored in a change address and then refunded back to the sender’s wallet address. </p>
<p>In this sense, change addresses are a very valuable part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem because they allow for fair interactions between wallets. Without change addresses, it wouldn’t be possible to transfer exact amounts between wallets. What’s more, users don’t even see that change addresses exist. While this process happens more often than we might think, it is a background calculation performed by the blockchain itself. </p>
<p>You can see your change address and how much of the funds you’ve sent have gone through it. However, no action is required on your part. The blockchain calculates how much a sender is inputting and what the necessary output is. If the input is insufficient, the transaction will fail. If the input is larger than the requested output, the blockchain will send the remaining funds to a change address. Seconds later, these funds will be returned back to the sender’s wallet. </p>
<div>Change addresses represent an important underlying function of all blockchains. While users might not see them when interacting with the blockchain and making transactions, change addresses are often utilized. Without them, it would have been impossible to send exact amounts to other wallets or to pay for NFTs, for example. </div>
<p>If you are curious to see your change address, you can easily view it in the details about any transaction you’ve made. The change address is visible, even if it was not used in the given blockchain interaction. </p>

<h2>What Is a Chargeback?</h2>
<p>Chargebacks are primarily a means of consumer protection; most often, they are initiated by consumers after fraudulent or erroneous charges, for example when they used their credit card to pay for a certain product but it was never delivered to them.</p>
<p>A demand is then made by the credit card provider for a retailer to make good on the loss on the fraudulent or disputed transaction, reversing said payment or money transfer after it was authorized.</p>
<p>The chargeback does not occur automatically nor instantaneously — the consumer must first successfully dispute the original charge and the final settlement can take up to several days.</p>
<p>Other potential reasons for initiating chargebacks include clerical errors like an accidental duplicate charge or technical issues that lead to mistaken charges. The threat of a possible chargeback incentivizes merchants to provide quality goods and services and be extra careful when charging their customers.</p>
<p>Additionally, chargebacks provide a measure of protection in cases of identity theft — when a person’s credit card is used without their knowledge or authorization with malicious intent.</p>
<p>On the flip side, consumers may also engage in chargeback fraud — deliberately trying to initiate a chargeback on a charge that they know was legitimate. </p>
<div>The impossibility of chargeback fraud in decentralized cryptocurrencies — where transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain and are irreversible — is one of the key advantages offered to merchants if they choose to accept crypto payments.</div>

<preview>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is one of the largest exchanges dealing in the trading of futures and options in the United States.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange? (CME)</h2>
<p>Initially founded in 1898 under the name &quot;Chicago Butter and Egg Board,” CME is one of the most important exchanges in the United States. In 1919, the exchange renamed itself the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and became a standard among traders in the country. While initially, the futures and stocks the exchange offered were focused predominantly on the foods and beverages industry, today CME is a leading exchange provider.</p>
<p>In many respects, CME is a revolutionizing force on the American stock market. In 1961, it was one of the first exchanges to start offering features. In 1972, CME introduced the first interest bond in the US, and CME was the first exchange  in 2000 to become a corporation, which is entirely owned by its shareholders. </p>
<p>In 2007, the CME exchange entered into a merger agreement with the Chicago Board of Trade, essentially creating the CME group, one of the largest financial exchanges globally. Since then, the CME has been actively purchasing partial or full ownership in other exchanges all over the U.S., including the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Commodity Exchange, Inc (COMEX). In 2010, CME Group also acquired a 90% interest in the Dow Jones stock and financial indexes, while in 2012, the group purchased the Kansas City Board of Trade.</p>
<div>Another streak of revolutionary action on CME’s part came in 2017 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange started actively trading in Bitcoin futures. Trading in futures has experienced a significant boost of interest from both enterprise and private investors in the past several decades. The CME group and all exchanges participating in it aim to provide a regulated, centralized environment with high liquidity, where investors can easily assume risks and bank on the fluctuation in prices of different assets.</div>
<div>CME Group is a big player in the exchanges industry in the United States. According to official CME reports, the corporation handles, on average, about 3 billion contracts worth approximately $1 quadrillion annually. This makes the CME group one of the most trusted exchange services providers in the US. The success of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and its affiliates largely lies in the fact the group constantly diversifies the tools and products it offers to investors. One of CME’s biggest advantages is its Globex platform, which was a pioneer in introducing electronic trading in 1987. By introducing cryptocurrency futures to the global trading community, CME pioneers the worldwide adoption of the asset on traditional exchanges. </div>

<preview>Chunk is a fraction of each block produced as a result of sharding in the NEAR protocol.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Chunk (NEAR)?</h2>
<p>A fraction of each block produced as a result of sharding on NEAR is called a Chunk.</p>
<div>Chunk is a part of the data sharding mechanism in the NEAR protocol, allowing the system to scale horizontally by splitting the blockchain state into non-overlapping chunks. Each chunk is managed by a group of validators, who together take care of storage and compute resources needed to process transactions related to that chunk.</div>
<p>Chunk provides two services:</p>
<p>State storage - Chunk maintains a history of states and provides an indexing and querying service on top of it.</p>
<div>Execution - Chunk executes transactions using the EVM and maintains a transaction history, which includes both failed and successful transactions.</div>
<div>NEAR uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus. A key property of this system is that anyone can participate as a validator (this is also why it is called &quot;open Proof of Stake&quot;). This ensures that we remain open and permissionless, while still being secure.</div>
<p>NEAR uses sharding to scale the network. This means that the more people using it, the faster it gets. Unlike many other systems, NEAR is designed with sharding in mind from day one and it is integrated into the core protocol.</p>
<p>It has a unique set of design tradeoffs that allow it to achieve the highest possible decentralization at a performance level close to centralized alternatives. It achieves this by using sharding (also known as horizontal scaling) which means parallelizing transactions across thousands of computers. NEAR uses &quot;shards&quot; - groups of computers (or &quot;validators&quot;) that process transactions concurrently, each processing a small part of all the transactions at any one time.</p>
<p>NEAR is a decentralized cloud computing network that allows developers to build on top of a shared infrastructure. This network is run by validators and stake-weighted community members, who are compensated for their contributions with NEAR tokens.</p>
<p>NEAR provides three main pillars for developers to create highly scalable applications:</p>
<p>Scalability: Developers can scale their applications to match the demand by using state sharding. The same machine learning model can be used across different shards, which reduces the cost of scaling.</p>
<p>Compute Resources: Developers can access compute resources (CPU, RAM) through the protocol to run their application.</p>
<p>NEAR Tokens: Users transact on the platform with NEAR tokens, which allow them to interact with services and applications built on top of the protocol.</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol has introduced “Chunk-Only Producers” to allow more people to take part in securing and decentralizing the network.</p>
<p>A chunk-only producer (COP) is a process that runs on a node and is responsible for producing blocks. In addition to the storage and networking components, each shard is equipped with a dedicated COP. The COP is only interested in producing chunks, not validating transactions or maintaining the state.</p>
<p>Chunks contain all transactions of a block, as well as the receipts and execution results of those transactions.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A cipher is any algorithm that can be used to encrypt and decrypt information.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Cipher?</h2>
<div>Ciphers arose as an answer to the need for people to exchange information in secret without third parties being able to violate their privacy. They are a fundamental concept in cryptography — the science of secure communication.</div>
<p>Ciphers work by transforming plaintext (the original message that the sender intends to encrypt) into ciphertext — the coded text that can be safely sent to the receiver. The receiver then needs to use an additional piece of information — commonly called a “key” — to decrypt the ciphertext back into plaintext.</p>
<p>The key is agreed upon by the sender and the receiver prior to initiating the communication, and a good cipher must produce such a ciphertext that is extremely difficult or impossible to decrypt without knowing the key.</p>
<p>The earlier ciphers that relied on pen and paper, and have by now been displaced by much more effective computer-assisted encryption methods, are often called classical ciphers. The two main types of these are substitution and transposition ciphers.</p>
<p>Advances in cryptanalysis have made these pen and paper ciphers easily crackable and effectively obsolete. The emergence in the mid-20th century of electromechanical encryption devices such as the Enigma machine had prolonged their usefulness somewhat, until the appearance of the corresponding decryption devices, such as the British bombe.</p>
<p>Since then, new cryptographic ciphers have emerged that are so computationally intensive that encryption can only be done effectively through the use of computers, and decryption is prohibitively expensive even with the most powerful machines available.</p>
<div>Cryptocurrencies rely heavily on the instruments of cryptography, including ciphers, to ensure the continuous operation and high security of their networks.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Ciphertext?</h2>
<p>In the world of cryptography, the ciphertext is a result of encryption that has been performed on plaintext through the usage of an algorithm, and this algorithm is known as a cipher.</p>
<p>Ciphertext is known as encrypted as well as encoded information due to the fact that it contains the original plaintext which is unreadable by an unauthorized party, or in other words, a person or a computer that does not have the proper cipher in order to decrypt it.</p>
<p>Decryption is the process of turning a ciphertext into a readable plaintext.</p>
<p>A cipher by itself is an algorithm that can be applied to plaintext in order to achieve ciphertext. It is the unreadable output of an encryption algorithm. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that earlier cipher algorithms that were performed manually differ from the modern algorithms that are executed through the usage of a machine. </p>
<p>One type of cipher is a substitution cipher, which offers an alternative to plaintext. Then there's a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, where a mixed alphabet is used to encrypt the plaintext, where at random points it will change to a different mixed alphabet that indicates the change with an uppercase letter.</p>
<p>Then there's the transposition cipher, which is known as a rail fence cipher and is a permutation of the plaintext.</p>
<p>There’s also a permutation cipher, where the positions which are held by the plaintext are shifted to a regular system so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext itself.</p>
<p>In private-key cryptography, the attacker is aware of the plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext. The sender, as well as the receiver, has a pre-shared key, and this key is kept secret from anyone else. DES and AES are algorithms that are used in his type of encryption. </p>
<p>In public-key cryptography, two different keys (the private key and the public key) are used for the encryption and the decryption process itself, where the sender uses the public key in order to perform the encryption and the receiver does not know the private key.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Circle (Company)? </h2>
<div>Circle is a fintech firm providing peer-to-peer payment technology. Through its platform, Circle enables consumers and businesses to make payments to one another using their mobile devices. It has been established with the belief that there is a better way to move money.</div>
<p>The idea for Circle was conceived in 2012 when three friends, Sean Neville, Jeremy Allaire, and John Collison, discussed how to solve the challenge of securely storing digital currency online. They recognized that in order to accelerate the adoption of the digital currency they needed to address the most common complaint with Bitcoin: its volatility. In 2013, Sean and Jeremy founded Circle Internet Financial Limited. Circle was granted an e-money license by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. The company set out to build a new kind of payment network that could be used anywhere in the world, across currencies, borders, and devices.</p>
<p>Today Circle is on a mission to make money work the way it should — safe, simple, free, and instant — everywhere people want it.</p>
<div>Circle launched USDC (a stablecoin) in 2018, which is backed by $1 or an asset with equal value. </div>
<div>With the launch of USD Coin, Circle is making the price stability and immutability of blockchain technology available to any business, project, or developer.</div>
<p>USD Coin is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. Dollar with a 1:1 ratio. It is an easy way to move money into, out of, and across crypto applications, exchanges, and protocols — providing a much-needed anchor for decentralized finance.</p>
<p>USD Coin is also a tool for innovators in traditional industries who can use it to explore new business models while avoiding the volatility risk linked to cryptocurrency, whether they're looking to send payments more efficiently or manage their cash flow more effectively. Finally, USD Coin makes it possible for consumers and businesses everywhere to participate in the crypto economy by exchanging USDC with the “native token” of any network they want to join, like Ethereum or Stellar.</p>

<file>circulating-supply.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public’s hands.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Circulating Supply?</h2>
<div>The amount of cryptocurrency coins or tokens in circulation is a fluctuating value that can increase and/or decrease over time.</div>
<div>If a cryptocurrency is mineable, new coins can be created gradually via mining. In the case of a centralized token, the supply can be increased by the developers at will via instantaneous minting.</div>
<div>The supply can also go down: either deliberately via burning, or as a result of accidents, like sending coins to an irrecoverable address or losing access to a wallet where funds are stored.</div>
<p>The network at large has no reliable knowledge of how much of the total supply is in active circulation, making the metric of circulating supply an imperfect approximation.</p>
<div>For example, even though nominally the circulating supply of Bitcoin (BTC) should be over 18 million coins — as that is how many Bitcoin have been mined since the network’s inception — it is estimated that around 4 million BTC have been permanently lost, placing the true circulating supply closer to 14 million.</div>
<div>Circulating supply should not be confused with total supply, which is the number of coins that have been mined so far minus all the coins that have been knowingly burned, and the maximum supply, which is the hard-coded limit that neither total nor circulating supply can ever exceed.</div>

<preview>A client is software that can access and process blockchain transactions on a local computer. A common application of this is a cryptocurrency software wallet.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Client?</h2>
<div>In computer science, a client is a piece of software or hardware (or an individual using such tools) that connects to the server in a client-server relationship, or to the rest of the network in a peer-to-peer environment. It allows end-users to remotely interact with other entities over the Internet.</div>
<div>In the cryptocurrency industry, software clients are used to connect to and interact with the blockchain network. As part of their operation, clients communicate with other nodes on the network.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrency clients are employed in numerous use cases. One of these is for miners, software that manages the operation of its user’s mining equipment and communicates the calculated hashes to the blockchain network.</div>
<div>Another example is a wallet, which allows users to deposit, store, send, receive and withdraw cryptocurrency coins and tokens. These often come with streamlined graphical user interfaces (GUIs) which allow even relatively unsophisticated users to easily manage their crypto funds.</div>
<div>There are also block explorers, which are used to access blockchain data, such as block height, current hashrate, overall transaction volume and individual transactions and more in a format that is easily readable by a human.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Close?</h2>
<div>The closing price is one of four major data points used in day trading in the stock, cryptocurrency and other markets to track the performance of an asset. The other three are opening, high and low prices, with all four known together as “OHLC.”</div>
<p>Before the emergence of electronic communication networks in 1969, stock exchange trading was conducted exclusively during regular market hours, for example, from 9:30 am to 16:00 pm for the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>As a result, assets’ performance could be clearly delineated between days: trading opened and closed at specific price points and within each day there were easily identifiable highest and lowest prices.</p>
<div>With the advancements in electronic trading, after-hours trading became available, albeit at significantly lower volumes compared to regular hours trading. This, however, has not made OHLC metrics obsolete — their usefulness for market analysis has ensured that they are still being tracked within the timeframe of regular market hours.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrency exchanges, which appeared in the early 2010s soon after the invention of cryptocurrencies themselves, supported 24/7 trading from the very beginning, owing to two facts: these platforms are located exclusively online and the assets listed on them are operational 100% of the time. However, they still provide their users with OHLC data, most commonly in the form of candlestick charts.</div>
<div>Closing price specifically is often considered by traders to be the most important of the four metrics, as it is used as a standard benchmark to evaluate an asset’s performance over different periods of time.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Cloud?</h2>
<p>A cloud is essentially a group of servers that are accessed through the usage of an internet connection. The software and the databases that run on those servers can also be considered the cloud. Cloud servers are typically located throughout different data centers all over the world, and by taking advantage of cloud computing, both the users and companies as a whole do not have to manage physical servers and can do all of this remotely.</p>
<p>In fact, through the cloud infrastructure, you can access the same files as well as applications from any device due to the fact that all of the computing, as well as storage, takes place on servers in a data center, instead of locally on your physical device.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is available through the usage of a technology known as virtualization, which allows for the creation of simulated, digital-only virtual computers that can behave as if they were physical computers that ran on their own hardware.</p>
<p>This is known and commonly referred to as a virtual machine. </p>
<p>When this is implemented correctly, the virtual machines on the same host machine are sandboxed from one another. In other words, they cannot really interact with each other, and the files, as well as applications from one virtual machine, are not visible to any other virtual machine, even though they essentially run on the same hardware.</p>
<p>Clouds make more efficient use of the hardware which hosts them, so you are not wasting any precious hardware that the server can offer.</p>
<p>There are multiple service models when it comes to cloud computing, and these include software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and function-as-a-service (FaaS).</p>
<p>You can deploy a private cloud, a public cloud, a hybrid cloud and a multicloud.</p>
<p>A private cloud is a server, data center or distributed network that is specifically distributed to one organization. A public cloud is a service that is run by an external vendor that can include servers in one or multiple data centers. A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds. A multicloud involves the usage of multiple public clouds.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Cloud Mining?</h2>
<div>Cryptocurrency mining, in general, is the practice of using computer hardware to perform the computational work necessary to secure the operation of a blockchain in return for rewards paid out by the network in newly created coins.</div>
<div>There is competition between cryptocurrency miners in any particular blockchain: their success depends on the efficiency of their mining rig. The most important characteristic of a mining device is its computational power, or hashrate — the number of hashes it can calculate per second, usually measured in GH/s or TH/s.</div>
<div>However, even the most powerful ASIC device that can calculate dozens of terahashes per second will not be efficient if it spends a disproportionate amount of electric power to do so, eating into the miner’s profit; this makes energy efficiency a second key factor.</div>
<p>Another consideration is the need to cool the rig — mining devices produce a lot of heat during operation so some additional electric power expenses are needed to remove that heat from the system.</p>
<p>Besides these key ones, many other factors come into play when determining the overall efficiency of a mining setup. To design a truly well-optimized crypto mining operation, one needs to have advanced software and hardware engineering skills or to obtain the services of a qualified engineer, which not every miner can afford.</p>
<div>Cloud mining emerged as the answer to this problem. Cloud mining companies set up dedicated crypto mining outfits in locations with relatively cheap electricity and often cold climates (alleviating the need for artificial cooling systems) and spend considerable effort to optimize the overall setup. They then rent out parts of their hashpower to remote clients via so-called mining contracts.</div>
<div>This arrangement allows small-scale miners to leverage the efficiency of the cloud mining provider’s setup by proxy. At the same time, the provider transfers some of the risks associated with the volatility of the crypto market onto its customers. They can also expand their operation faster due to the fact that by purchasing mining contracts the customers, in a way, credit them the mining profits which would be otherwise spread over time.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Co-Signer?</h2>
<div>Co-signers are a concept closely related to multi-signature cryptocurrency wallets.</div>
<div>Most commonly, cryptocurrency wallets are designed for single-key access — that is, in order to manage the funds the owner needs to use their one private key. While simple, convenient and secure enough under most circumstances, these wallets offer insufficient protection in some contexts.</div>
<div>Multi-signature wallets are a more secure variant of a cryptocurrency wallet: they require multiple people or organizations to provide their own unique keys before allowing access to the stored funds. The signature requirements can be configured in various ways: for example, 2-of-3, one of the common ones, needs two out of a total of three keys to unlock funds. The people using their private keys, in this context, are co-signers.</div>
<p>Co-signing the release of cryptocurrency funds may be required in different scenarios. One of the most popular ones is simple security enhancement of a personal wallet: by using a multi-signature wallet and storing the signatures needed to open it on several different devices, a single user can protect themselves from the loss or theft of one or more of the keys.</p>
<p>Another important use case is relevant to businesses: storing the majority of a company’s cryptocurrency funds on a single-signature wallet subjects them to excessive security and organizational risks. By requiring the keys of a majority of multiple co-signers (for example, board members) a multi-sig wallet protects its contents from misuse or outright theft by a single employee.</p>

<h2>What Does Code Mean?</h2>
<p>The action of coding is to write programming statements, or in other words, write the source code for a program.</p>
<p>In communications as well as information processing, code is a system of rules that converts information into another form, which is shortened or secret. This is essentially the process that revolves around encoding, which converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. On the other end of this spectrum, we have decoding, which is the reverse process that converts code symbols back into a form that we understand.</p>
<p>In cryptography specifically, code has both specific technical meanings and general meanings. If we look at it from a technical viewpoint, code is the substation of one word or phrase by another word, number or symbol. This is done to conceal the original word or phrase.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Are Coins?</h2>
<div>Coins are cryptocurrencies that operate on their own blockchains and are independent of any other coins. A single unit of such cryptocurrency can also be called a coin. The term is used to distinguish autonomous cryptocurrencies from tokens, which operate on top of their parent blockchain platforms, like Ethereum (ETH).</div>
<div>The first-ever coin on the cryptocurrency market was Bitcoin (BTC), launched in January 2009. It uses a decentralized, geographically distributed ledger, called the blockchain, in order to keep track of all transactions that take place on its network and ensure that nobody can create new coins via means other than the computationally-intensive process of mining.</div>
<div>Afterward, many new coins have appeared, some based on their own blockchains designed from scratch, and some — called forks — based on the blockchain of a different, already existing coin. For example, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG) are forks of Bitcoin and, at the moment of their creation, had the same blockchains.</div>
<div>However, they are still considered coins, i.e. independent cryptocurrencies because, after the point of the fork, their blockchains continued operating in complete separation from Bitcoin’s.</div>
<div>In contrast, some platforms, such as Ethereum and EOS (EOS), allow people to create tokens — cryptocurrencies whose operation relies entirely on the operation of the parent blockchain and which would stop being usable if the underlying platform ever went down.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Coin mixers allow users to mix up transactions between different cryptocurrency addresses, so they become untraceable and cannot be followed back to the initial sender or receiver of the asse</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Coin Mixer?</h2>
<div>In essence, coin mixing ensures that both parties in a transaction remain anonymous. Cryptocurrency transactions are all recorded on a distributed, public blockchain ledger, which means that anyone, anywhere, has access to these records. By inputting a public address in a block explorer, you can get information about all transactions made to and from this address. This incredible level of transparency is one of the innate characteristics of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Even so, some parties would like to benefit from ultimate anonymity, which is why coin mixers were created. </div>
<div>Coin mixers are software companies which serve as a middleman between parties looking to send and receive cryptocurrencies. For example, Person A is looking to send Person B one Bitcoin (BTC); however, they do not want this transaction to be traceable. Person A would turn to the services of a coin mixer company. They will send the amount of Bitcoin to the coin mixer. The coin mixer will then combine this transaction with numerous other transactions, accumulating a larger amount of the same cryptocurrency and then redistributing it to the selected receiving addresses.</div>
<p>However, an important note here is that coin mixers charge a fee for their mixing services. This essentially means that when sending cryptocurrency to a coin mixer, you need to consider the service fees, which will be deducted before funds are redistributed to their intended receiving addresses. It is important to take into account that most coin mixers charge a percentage-based fee. Consequently, the larger the amount of cryptocurrency you input into the mixer, the more you will have to pay in fees. </p>
<p>Coin mixers have become an essential service in the cryptocurrency industry, as many people are looking to keep their anonymity. This also concerns big enterprises and corporations looking to remain anonymous when transferring larger amounts of funds. </p>
<p>Yet coin mixers remain a controversial topic in the cryptocurrency world. Some people defend the need for such services to keep the innate anonymity that was part of the conception of cryptocurrencies. However, others argue that coin mixers facilitate the transaction of funds for illegal activities. Not only that, proponents arguing against coin mixers state that this software can be easily manipulated to defraud customers and steal their funds. Both sides of the argument have valid concerns; however, for the moment, coin mixers remain a service available to the crypto community. </p>
<div>Coin mixers are increasingly popular among cryptocurrency whales, who are looking to conceal the amount of cryptocurrency they have. Large holdings of cryptocurrency can attract unwanted attention towards a holder’s address, thus putting them at risk. Considering this, cryptocurrency investors usually turn to the services of coin mixers to ensure the safety of their assets.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>In mineable cryptocurrencies, a coinbase is the number of coins that are generated from scratch and awarded to miners for mining every new block.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Coinbase?</h2>
<div>Some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin (BTC), are mineable, meaning that they allow any user to contribute their computational power to securing the operation of the coin. The miners do this by collecting the most recent transactions that have taken place on the network, packaging them into blocks, securing these blocks with cryptographic hashes and adding them to the end of the blockchain.</div>
<div>As this process involves the expenditure of electricity and the operation of specialized equipment, mining is incentivized by the network by including a special transaction in every new block that sends a certain amount of newly “mined,” i.e. created coins to the person or organization that has mined that block. This transaction is called the generation transaction and the coins included in it are the coinbase of the block.</div>
<div>Bitcoin and many other mineable coins use the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) model: every transaction consists of inputs and outputs and the coins which are stored on addresses are not literal balances, but rather collections of outputs from all the previous transactions to this address. In this context, the coinbase is the input of the generation transaction, whose output of the same amount gets sent to the miner.</div>
<div>Bitcoin’s coinbase used to be 50 BTC at the launch of its network. This amount gets halved approximately every four years and as of November 2020, it is equal to 6.25 coins.</div>

<preview>The first transaction in a new block is a coinbase transaction in which the miner receives Bitcoins and mining fees.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Coinbase Transaction?</h2>
<div>All transactions on the blockchain are not the result of an exchange of coins between two people. For example, the very first transaction on a block, called a coinbase transaction, is different from the rest. Taking the Bitcoin network as an example, BTC was used for the very first transaction on the network. Inside the genesis block, it was a special transaction that structured reward. These reward transactions are given to the miner as a token of appreciation for their efforts. These kinds of transactions result in the creation of new currencies that have never been spent before.</div>
<p>Rather than UTXOs, such transactions only have one input (the coinbase) and they must be confirmed by 100 blocks. The block reward and total transaction fees within the block are the outputs, which can be transferred to one or more addresses.</p>
<div>Surprisingly, Satoshi Nakamoto's genesis block transaction, which was the first-ever coinbase transaction, cannot be spent. This is because, while being viewable on the blockchain, the transaction was not registered with a transaction database and hence cannot be spent. </div>
<h2>What Is the Genesis Block?</h2>
<p>The genesis block, also known as block zero, was generated using Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. The block's role was critical in getting Bitcoin up and running. On the 3rd of January, 2009, this block was built. It was distinct from the rest of the blockchain since it was the first to be created. As a result, the parameters for its production were different as well.</p>
<p>The genesis block of Bitcoin has a peculiar feature: Satoshi Nakamoto put a message in the block code that reads: &quot;The Times 03/Jan/ 2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.”</p>
<p>This is the title of a story published in The Times on January 3, 2009, in which it was said that the British government was assisting and rescuing the banks.</p>
<p>As a result, the newspaper headline has been subjected to several examinations, resulting in the physical copy of the newspaper becoming a collector's item. The fundamental reason for this is that the title is credited to Satoshi Nakamoto's concept of producing a cryptocurrency without the need for bank interference.</p>
<p>The purpose for the message on the block is unknown because the Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, never said anything about it.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of a Coinbase Transaction</h2>
<p>When a new block on the blockchain is created, it contains a list of validated transactions. Each of these transactions is initiated by the blockchain's users. Despite this, the first of these transactions is called the coinbase transaction. This transaction's base amount is equal to the current active reward for mining that block.</p>
<div>This signifies that the value of this transaction is connected to the current block's reward and is influenced by the current halving of the coin. Let's not forget that halving is an event that occurs after every 210,000 blocks are mined in the Bitcoin network (or roughly after four years). Moreover, cryptocurrencies that operate like Bitcoin have their own halving and reward systems. The purpose of this halving is to cut the miner’s incentives in half and therefore keep inflation under control. The incentives in Bitcoin, for example, began with a value of 50 BTC every block. After that, they dropped to 25 BTC, and now it's at 12.5 BTC. A coinbase transaction now has a value of 12.5 BTC, which is paid to the legitimate block miner or miners.</div>
<p>Miners are the ones who produce coinbase transactions, which gives it an odd quirk. Because the miner is the one who creates the transaction, he may be able to influence it. To circumvent this, the transaction reward may only be utilized after 100 confirmations. This guarantees that the block satisfies all of the criteria for being completely valid. This hedging feature is especially useful in the case of a blockchain fork since it protects the network's coins.</p>

<title>Cold Storage</title>

<file>cold-storage.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Offline storage of cryptocurrencies, typically involving hardware non-custodial wallets, USBs, offline computers, or paper wallets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Cold Storage?</h2>
<div>Cryptocurrency wallets used to receive, store and send cryptocurrencies are usually divided into two categories: hosted and cold wallets.</div>
<p>Hosted wallets, or hot wallets, are software that can be accessed via the website of a wallet service provider and are the more widespread option owing to their ease of use, convenience and constant availability.</p>
<div>Access to the funds stored on a wallet is secured by a single or multiple private keys in the cases of single-signature or multisig wallets respectively. If the private keys become compromised, for example, as a result of theft or via a phishing attack, the funds stored on the wallet may end up stolen and permanently lost. In such a case there is little to no recourse for their original owner due to the fact that blockchain transactions are irreversible and the identities of cryptocurrency users are anonymous.</div>
<div>Cold storage provides an additional layer of protection for user funds by air gapping the wallet, i.e. physically disconnecting it from unsecure networks, most importantly the public Internet, when not in use. As long as the physical cold wallet remains in a secure location, it is impossible for potential attackers to access the coins stored on it.</div>
<div>Cold storage is used both by individuals and, especially, by companies whose business model involves holding custody over customers’ funds, such as cryptocurrency exchanges.</div>
<div>There are many different methods of cold storage, but the most popular ones are paper and hardware wallets. A paper wallet is simply a physical piece of paper with the wallet’s public and private keys printed on it. A hardware wallet is a special device, like a USB drive, which needs to be physically plugged into a computer in order to access funds.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Cold Wallet?</h2>
<div>Cold wallets are cryptocurrency wallets that are not connected to the internet or any other unsecure networks when not in use. This is done to provide an additional layer of security over that offered by the more widespread hot wallets, which are software wallets stored on a user’s local computer or accessed from a service provider’s servers via a website interface.</div>
<div>Cold wallets are employed by individual cryptocurrency users as an affordable and relatively simple way of insulating one’s crypto funds against the threat hacks, phishing and other vectors of attack that may lead to permanent loss of coins.</div>
<div>They are even more in demand with businesses that hold custody over their customers’ funds, such as cryptocurrency exchanges. By storing the coins that belong to tens or even hundreds of thousands of users in a centralized manner, these businesses become highly enticing targets for hackers and physically separating most of the reserves from the Internet is the only reliable way to protect from attacks.</div>
<p>Cold wallets come in many different forms, the two most popular ones being paper and hardware wallets.</p>
<div>A paper wallet is a piece of paper with the public address and the private key of the wallet printed on it. The public address is used to receive cryptocurrency and the private key to access the funds stored and send them. Paper wallets often come with QR codes that can be scanned with a smartphone for ease of use.</div>
<p>A hardware wallet is an electronic device that must be physically plugged into a computer to be accessed. These can range from amateur homemade inventions to commercially available consumer devices (often in the form-factor of a USB stick or drive) to proprietary solutions designed by professional engineers to order.</p>
<p>Other, less popular cold wallet types include smart cards and even sound wallets, which store private keys in the form of audio on CDs or vinyl records.</p>

<title>Collateral</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateral</url>
<file>collateral.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Collateral is any asset that a lender accepts as a form of security to ensure that the borrower repays a loan.</preview>
<description>
<p>Collateral is one of the most important terms in today’s financial world. </p>
<p>Collateral represents any asset that is offered as security when someone takes out a loan. The idea behind collateral is to ensure that the borrower is going to either pay back the loan to get back the collateral or the lender will have the equivalent of the sum borrowed. The way collateral works depends on the agreement signed by the lender and the borrower. </p>
<p>One of the most used forms of collateral is property. When you take out a mortgage, for example, the property you’re buying is the collateral. The bank gives you a loan under the condition that if you fail to pay your debt, the bank is going to take ownership of the property you bought. This form of collateral is often referred to as a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO).</p>
<div>While mortgages are the most popular form of collateral agreements, any other asset can be considered collateral if the lender agrees. For example, you can borrow money against your car, a given amount of gold or silver, or even your watch. Depending on the institution or person who assumes the role of a lender, and the type of loan you need,  collateral can be almost anything that has monetary value.</div>
<p>The main idea behind collateral is to minimize risk for the lender as much as possible. Taking collateral is the lender’s guarantee that even if the borrower defaults on their loan, the lender will not be left empty-handed. Traditionally, banks can offer customer credit lines without collateral when smaller amounts are requested. However, when a loan request surpasses a certain amount, the bank usually requests some form of collateral. </p>
<div>One important thing to note here is that usually, loans backed by collateral offer significantly better interest rates. As the borrower offers additional assurance to the lender that the loan will be repaid, interest rates for collateralized loans are traditionally lower. This is one of the reasons why collateral-based loans have become so popular over time. While the borrower is required to forfeit the collateral if they default on the loan, the total amount they have to repay is smaller. Considering this, many borrowers prefer to offer collateral in order to reduce the additional cost high interest rates lead to. </div>
<div>In cryptocurrency, collateralization is also steadily gaining traction with the introduction of collateral tokens. The idea behind collateral tokens is largely the same as in the traditional financial markets, as they serve as a risk mitigator for crypto-based lenders. As cryptocurrency loans become more popular, and people turn to the blockchain to manage their finance, collateral tokens are also becoming increasingly sought after. </div>

<preview>Collateral cap is a security feature designed to diversify protocol-wide lending risk away from any one asset.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Collateral Cap?</h2>
<p>Collateral cap is a security feature designed to diversify protocol-wide lending risk away from any one asset. It specifies a market’s maximum effective collateral, measured in units of the respective token, and is a way to allow the ‘borrowing power’ per asset to be measured and limited.</p>
<p>For example, if a market’s collateral cap is set to 1 million tokens, then only 1 million of that token can be used as collateral for borrowing.</p>
<div>This helps to reduce systemic risks created by single assets, especially risks brought by assets with lower on-chain liquidity. For example, if a protocol were to seize an asset from liquidating the collateral provided, it might not be able to be converted or swapped into other assets due to the lack of on-chain liquidity. </div>
<div>In other words, collateral cap is a per-token setting to control and limit protocol risks associated with each token market. Abnormal and unexpected price drops can be caused by a multitude of reasons ranging from infinite minting of tokens or coins, protocol rugs, or exploits of any sort. </div>
<p>Collateral caps thus limit the maximum potential loss that the protocol would possibly suffer from a collapse or extreme price drops in the corresponding token markets, and are an effective way to control and manage risks. It is a critical feature that needs to be monitored and readjusted especially in volatile market conditions – as improper management can impact the lending and borrowing protocols and the ecosystems they are linked to in a chain effect.</p>

<title>Collateral Factor</title>

<file>collateral-factor.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Collateral Factor is the maximum amount a user can borrow, represented in percentages, based on the total amount of assets supplied.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Collateral Factor?</h2>
<div>Collateral Factor is the maximum amount a user can borrow, represented in percentages, based on the total amount of assets supplied. It is also represented by the loan to value ratio (LTV) for various DeFi lending and borrowing protocols, as well as traditional financial institutions.   </div>
<p>In the context of cryptocurrencies, if the Collateral Factor or LTV of USDC is 75%, and a user supplies 100 USDC (worth $100) the user’s borrow limit on this asset would be $75 (100 USDC * 75%) to borrow other assets. </p>
<p>Generally, more liquid or less volatile assets have higher collateral factors, which can change with market conditions. Different platforms and protocols have their own designated collateral factor depending on their assessment of the asset  </p>
<div>If an asset has a 0% collateral factor, it cannot be used as collateral for borrowing other assets, though the asset itself can still be borrowed.
Depending on individual risk profiles, users can use the collateral factor to minimize liquidation risk and have more leeway to maintain the health of their positions. For example, if the collateral factor of a blue-chip asset like BTC or ETH is 60%, users who deposit those assets and borrow 30% against them have a relatively lower liquidation risk as compared to others who choose to maximize the borrow limits.
Lower collateral factors can also be utilized as a way for projects and protocols to mitigate or control risks for assets with lower on-chain liquidity, as those are more volatile and likely to have drastic price fluctuations leading to events such as liquidation cascades.</div>

<title>Collateral Tokens</title>

<file>collateral-tokens.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>In cryptocurrency, collateral tokens are used as a risk mitigation asset when borrowing other types of crypto tokens.</preview>
<description>
<p>Just like with collateral used in traditional finance, collateral tokens serve as a risk-mitigating asset for lenders when borrowers want to get a crypto loan. Traditionally, collateral is an asset that can cover at least a portion of the loan the borrower is taking. The most common form of collateral is property. For example, when taking out a mortgage to buy a new house, you are actually offering the house as collateral, in the event you cannot repay that mortgage.</p>
<div>In crypto, the process of collateralization works in relatively the same way. When you want to borrow cryptocurrency and the lender wants to mitigate their risk, they ask for collateral. Since the lender-borrower communication happens on the blockchain, collateral tokens came into existence. Essentially, borrowers deposit a set amount of one token in order to receive a set amount of a different token, for example, BTC or ETH. </div>
<div>There are numerous collateral tokens nowadays. The collateral token a borrower needs to deposit is determined by the loan platform. For example, one of the more recognizable collateral tokens at the moment is COLL, or Collateral Pay. The token was specifically designed to serve as a collateral token, and it allows holders to pay for goods and services with fiat, borrowed against their COLL holdings. </div>
<div>With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), a need for a modern-day, blockchain-based lending ecosystem has become apparent. Thanks to collateral tokens, building this ecosystem becomes more achievable. While traditional lenders have had collateral as insurance for their investment, this was not the case with crypto in the beginning. As the blockchain space becomes more widely accessible, and cryptocurrencies gain traction, lending with security was needed. </div>
<p>Collateral tokens are a great way to solve the high-risk problem crypto lenders face. By taking a deposit in collateral tokens, lenders have the security that even in the scenario of a defaulted loan, they will receive some capital back. Depending on the type of loan and the collateral tokens required, the security deposit might be quite substantial. Additionally, as is the case with COLL, crypto enthusiasts can also use their collateral tokens to pay for goods and services in fiat. This level of flexibility is incredibly beneficial for crypto investors, as it gives them a versatile portfolio that can be utilized on a daily basis. </p>
<p>Collateral tokens are an important part of the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem. They have their foundation in traditional finance, but build on that foundation to bring lending into the crypto ecosystem. </p>

<title>Collateralization</title>

<file>collateralization.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Collateralization is the process of using one asset as insurance for securing a loan in a different asset.</preview>
<description>
<p>In modern finance, collateralization is one of the most popular insurance mechanisms that lenders require in order to give a loan to a borrower. With loans for more substantial amounts, lenders often find themselves in a situation where the risk of a defaulted loan is too great. This is where collateralization comes in very handy.</p>
<div>In simple terms, collateralization is the process of offering one type of asset (this could be property, fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities or anything else that holds value) in order to receive a loan in a different asset. </div>
<p>Imagine that you are looking to purchase a first home for your family. Property is on the expensive end of the spectrum, so you might need a rather substantial loan. In this case, many traditional financial institutions would offer you a mortgage for the house you want to purchase. </p>
<p>In essence, you are collateralizing your future home and agreeing that the bank will take ownership of your house in the event you default on your mortgage. While mortgages are the most common form of collateralization in traditional finance, borrowers and lenders have a lot more flexibility in the crypto world. </p>
<div>Crypto lending platforms can accept almost any kind of cryptocurrency token as collateral in order to give a loan in different crypto tokens. Of course, in this scenario, lenders need to keep in mind that crypto tokens are volatile in nature. This means that if the lender accepted collateral in ETH, for example, and the price for one ETH token tumbled significantly, the weight of the collateral they took might not be enough to cover potential losses. </div>
<div>In order to mitigate this risk, many crypto lenders turn to stablecoins that are pegged to a fiat currency. Some of the most popular examples include USDT and USDC. These tokens are tied to the current value of US dollars, and they cannot drastically change in price. </div>
<p>Another popular choice for collateralization in crypto lending are the so-called collateral tokens. These cryptocurrencies were specifically designed to serve as collateral, which means that the lender is more secure in their investment.</p>
<div>Collateralization is one of the primary mechanisms lenders all over the world have in their arsenal in order to mitigate any potential losses on their investment. On the other hand, collateralization of assets is also beneficial to the borrower, as in many cases, loans with collateral have significantly lower interest rates. In crypto, there is still plenty of room for exploration when it comes to collateralization. As of recently, lenders have started accepting NFTs and other forms of crypto-assets for collateralized loans. </div>

<title>Collateralized Debt Obligation</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/collateralized-debt-obligation</url>
<file>collateralized-debt-obligation.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) represents a mixture of loans and assets that are offered to big investment firms with a lot of capital.</preview>
<description>
<div>Collateralized debt obligations were first introduced oi the U.S. financial landscape in 1987 by the former investment bank, Drexel Burnham Lambert. However, this type of derivative really came into the spotlight during the global financial crisis of 2008. </div>
<div>In essence, collateralized debt obligations are a combination of numerous smaller loans which are put together and offered to an institutional investor. These smaller loans can include anything from mortgages to automobile leases and student loans. The idea behind a CDO is to combine a number of loans into this bigger asset, which is then resold to a bigger investment company. In this scenario, the people or institutions who initially gave out the loans receive a lump sum of money, while the new investor gets the loans and all the collateral behind them. </div>
<p>Collateral is any form of asset (property, car, commodities) that is given to a lender in order for the borrower to take out a loan. In the case of collateralized debt obligations, the collateral is usually a car or a property. CDO’s are typically created by banks and then offered to institutional investors.</p>
<p>When banks select a mixture of loans and assets for a CDO, they are looking to create a balanced ratio between risk and reward. There are a wide variety of assets that can be included in a CDO. Mortgage-backed securities, for example, consist of mortgage loans, while asset-backed securities consist of corporate and private debt, automobile leases and loans, and credit card debt. A CDO can include any of these types of loans and debt obligations. </p>
<p>While between 2003 and 2007, CDOs were regarded as the next big hit in institutional investment, they quickly saw their demise with the sub-prime mortgage crisis that hit the U.S. in 2007. Unfortunately, many of the CDOs that were sold between 2006 and 2008 comprised mortgage-backed securities, which in turn carried higher risk. As more people were defaulting on their mortgages, many of these CDOs started rapidly losing their value. </p>
<p>Since the housing bubble burst in the U.S., CDOs have somewhat lost their spot among the most preferred derivative investment options. Even so, banks still utilize them on a much smaller scale to generate liquidity faster.</p>
<div>Collateralized debt obligations remain some of the more risky investment opportunities out there. However, their practical usefulness for banks is undeniable. Of course, investors who are more prone to making risk-heavy purchases are also drawn towards CDOs, as the potential gain with them sometimes far outweighs the risk. CDOs are also a great way to diversify your investment portfolio. </div>

<preview>A collateralized debt position is held by locking collateral in smart contracts to generate stablecoins.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)?</h2>
<p>A collateralized debt position (CDP) is the position created by locking collateral in MakerDAO’s smart contract to generate its decentralized stablecoin, DAI.This system was introduced to the decentralized finance world by the MakerDAO team and is how its decentralized stablecoin DAI is created.</p>
<div>The value of the collateral locked in a CDP needs always to exceed 150% of the value of DAI that it was used to generate. If a position becomes undercollateralized, the assets locked in the smart contract get sold to pay back for the DAI generated, a 13% liquidation penalty and the stability fees (currently at 8.5% per year.)</div>
<div>The generated DAI is basically a decentralized loan backed by the value of the collateral; in order to unlock the collateral, a user needs to pay back the DAI generated plus the stability fees. Each of the DAI stablecoins in circulation — nearly 440 million at the time of writing — has been created this way.</div>
<p>Traditionally, only Ether could be used to fund MakerDAO’s CDPs, but now BAT, USDC, WBTC, TUSD, KNC, ZRX and MANA are also supported. A decentralized stablecoin backed by Ether-only is still available and is called SAI.</p>
<p>While MakerDAO introduced CDPs, technically other DeFi projects could adopt CDPs both as a term and a system in the future.</p>

<title>Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO)</title>

<file>collateralized-mortgage-obligation-cmo.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) is essentially a bundle of numerous mortgages combined in a package and sold to investors.</preview>
<description>
<div>A collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) is one of a number of mortgage-backed security used by banks to boost their liquidity. In simple terms, a CMO is a collection of several mortgages taken out by different people or companies bundled together. This bundle of loans is then offered to investors so that the bank can quickly attain some liquidity. In contrast, the investor receives a collateralized loan package and any further repayments on the loans. </div>
<p>CMOs are a very versatile type of investment. On the one hand, they carry significant risks for the company or fund purchasing them. As this is essentially a mixture of several mortgages, the risk increases as more than one of these might turn into a defaulted loan. However, on the flip side of things, the investor receives a lot of collateral with these bundles. Imagine a CMO consists of five different mortgage loans — this means that the new owner of the CMO either receives payments on five different loans or, if these loans default, gets ownership over five different properties. </p>
<p>In this sense, CMOs are a useful tool for both banks and investors alike. Unfortunately, because of the highly unpredictable nature of the financial market, CMOs are also among the riskiest investments.</p>
<div>A good example of CMOs in action was the financial crisis of 2008. The financial world in the US, and later on globally, crashed because of an influx of defaulting collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). CDOs essentially take the principle of CMO one step further and allow banks to bundle up mortgage loans and other types of credits. In 2008, many of the CMOs in these debt obligations started defaulting, as more and more people couldn’t afford to pay their monthly installments. While in theory, this should have been good for the investors, as they started owning a lot of property, the whole housing market crashed, and the value of property fell significantly. This essentially meant that a lot of institutional investors lost significant amounts of money while people were losing their homes. </div>
<div>Since 2008, central banks and regulators have introduced better and stricter rules regarding CDOs and CMOs. Considering this, the investors are now turning their attention back to this type of security-backed purchase. While the financial crisis hit hard, CMOs remain a viable investment opportunity. With improved regulation, and more vigilant banks, the housing market is bouncing back, and CMOs are becoming more valuable. CMOs are also a great way to diversify your investment portfolio. </div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A “collateralized stablecoin” is a stablecoin that is entirely or almost entirely backed by collateral held in a reserve.</preview>
<description>
<div>A stablecoin is a digital asset built on the blockchain that is designed to maintain a price peg at a designated price, most often $1. In order to maintain their use and legitimacy as a payment method, they must have some backing in fiat cash, cryptocurrency or on-chain tokens that it can be redeemed/swapped against. This backing is called collateral. </div>
<p>A “collateralized stablecoin” is a stablecoin that is entirely or almost entirely backed by collateral held in a reserve. Notable examples of fully-collateralized stablecoins include USDT, USDC and DAI. The collateral is used to provide holders of the token with an opportunity to redeem the tokens for U.S. dollars or other assets that can then be used in the real world. </p>
<p>Collateral that is committed to these stablecoins can vary between cash, commercial papers, bond purchases and more. The collateral itself can often be used for further investment purposes to improve capital efficiency. Stablecoins that fully commit their collateral to onchain assets like crypto rather than traditional financial bonds/paper are often referred to as “decentralized stablecoins.” </p>
<p>One limitation of collateralized stablecoins is the fact that they require such large amounts of capital for legitimacy and trust, and their ability to remain stable depends on the underlying collateral. This means that many collateralized stablecoins require over-collateralization so fluctuations in value can be absorbed. This differs from algorithmic stablecoins (ie: FRAX, ESD, etc.) which use smart contracts to respond to supply and demand by buying, selling and/or burning tokens to maintain a peg.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Commingling of funds is a method of combining all funds from different investors into a single investment in order to maximize the benefits.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Commingling?</h2>
<div>Commingling, in securities investing, is a process in which money from several different investors is pooled into one fund. In investment management, commingling involves combining assets contributed by investors into a single fund or investment vehicle. This single fund is then part-owned by each contributor. A commingled fund structure is also used to manage institutional investment funds.</div>
<div>The process is done due to its multiple benefits. Using pooled funds allows fund managers to keep trading costs down since trades can be executed in larger blocks. Additionally, commingled funds offer investors the advantage of scale as a larger pool of money provides access to a wider range of investments that may require a larger buy-in. </div>
<div>Furthermore, all types of commingled funds offer investors advantages of scale, meaning you’re likely to get a better return through a commingled fund than through an investment vehicle that keeps your invested funds separate.</div>
<p>Individual investors also pay smaller fees to their broker because the fund pays the broker’s fees rather than individually. This is more cost-efficient than hiring personal investment managers to handle smaller sums of investments.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)?</h2>
<div>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is an independent federal regulatory agency. It is responsible for regulating the U.S. derivatives market, which includes futures, swaps and certain kinds of options, by promoting its integrity and resilience. It prohibits fraudulent activity in these markets. </div>
<div>The CFTC was founded in 1974 with the enactment of the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions Act. During this time, most futures trading took place in the agricultural sector of the country. Since then, the Commission has had to diversify and modernize accordingly and its jurisdiction to include foreign currencies, as well as national and international government securities and stock indices. </div>
<div>When the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 was passed, the Commission’s mandate was expanded to develop a joint regulatory regime for single-stock futures with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, since the 2008 financial crash and the 2010 enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the CFTC has transitioned to provide more regulation to the dollar swaps market. </div>
<div>In 2014, the CFTC announced that it was considering regulating Bitcoin. It has since taken the position that Bitcoin is a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Subsequently, in 2019, Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain was also declared a commodity by former CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert. The Commission has also noted several risks associated with trading cryptocurrency due in part to market volatility. In recent years, it has also expanded its efforts to clamp down on fraud and misappropriation in the digital currency market.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is the COMP Token (Compound)?</h2>
<div>The COMP token is the native asset of the Compound protocol, built on Ethereum. As a governance token, COMP allows holders to vote on protocol upgrades and changes to the interest rates lenders earn. The Compound team has committed to a transparent process for deciding which proposals are included in future versions of the protocol and has penned down an initial set of voting rules.</div>
<div>The launch of COMP increases the diversity of Compound’s governance structure and will ensure that it remains community-governed in perpetuity. It has a few different functions in the protocol:</div>
<p>Governance: Token holders can propose and vote on protocol changes, such as changing interest rates or adding new assets.</p>
<p>Liquidity Mining: Lenders and borrowers can earn COMP rewards for their activity on the platform.</p>
<p>Each day, 2,312 COMP are distributed to users of the protocol. Each market has allocated distribution, which’s set by token holders through the governance process. As of 25 March 2022, the daily distribution is 2,312 and the remaining distribution is 2,985,509.</p>
<p>The distribution in each market is divided equally between suppliers and borrowers.</p>
<div>Compound is an Ethereum-based protocol. It allows developers to create money markets. Money markets allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency. The protocol enables developers to connect their applications to a pool of liquidity that's instantly available for borrowing and to earn interest on any assets they supply as lenders.</div>
<div>Compound is designed to be a fully open-source protocol, free for anyone to audit and use. It has no owner, manager or administrator; it is entirely autonomous, and anyone can interact with it freely. It is permissionless — anyone can deploy an interface or application on top of the protocol, or connect their own cryptocurrency wallet directly.</div>
<div>Compound is accessible via a web interface and an application programming interface (API), allowing anyone to deposit or withdraw assets to earn an automatically adjusted rate of return.</div>
<p>To understand the compound protocol, it's important to understand the underlying economic and game-theoretic incentives of the system. For this reason, we're going to walk through a simple example:</p>
<p>Suppose you want to borrow 100 DAI from the Compound protocol. The interest rate for borrowing DAI is currently 0.02% per block. How much interest will you pay? The answer is: it depends.</p>
<p>The interest rate for borrowing is actually a variable that is adjusted based on market conditions. The Compound protocol uses an algorithm called a bonding curve to ensure that its market has roughly the same supply and demand characteristics as a traditional financial asset. The algorithm works by adjusting the interest rate for borrowing along a curve.</p>

<title>Composable DeFi</title>

<file>composable-defi.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Composable DeFi refers to the interoperability between different DeFi protocols.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Composable DeFi?</h2>
<div>Ever since Ethereum launched its programmable smart contracts, the blockchain ecosystem witnessed the rise of a new vertical called decentralized finance (DeFi). Over the years, the DeFi ecosystem has evolved into a permissionless and borderless marketplace, reinventing the traditional finance (TradFi) structure by enabling anyone with an internet connection to access a wide range of financial products.</div>
<div>While most of the credit for this burgeoning DeFi ecosystem is given to smart contracts, we often don’t discuss the underlying features. Composability is a feature of smart contracts that binds the entire DeFi ecosystem together, whether decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing protocols, collateralized loans, synthetic assets, leveraged trading, futures markets, payment networks, and more.</div>
<div>Composability allows all these products to work in tandem, thus creating a parallel financial system that is globally accessible without any centralized authorities. Technically, composability is defined as a technical feature that allows different components within a system to be combined to support new use cases. Through composable DeFi, developers can leverage different combinations of existing protocols and dApps without any special permissions.</div>
<h2>How Does Composability Work in DeFi?</h2>
<p>DeFi dApps and protocols also referred to as “Money Legos,” are open-source, which allows them to communicate with each other. This open-source nature of DeFi also enables these dApps and protocols to leverage each other’s code and utility, facilitating a synergistic effect.</p>
<div>For instance, the Ethereum blockchain is home to many DeFi products. Since it is permissionless, anyone can build dApps and integrate any element from any existing protocol on the Ethereum chain by paying the gas fee for transactions. </div>
<div>This is possible due to the composability feature embedded in smart contracts. Composability enables developers (and users) to carry complex strategies like borrowing ERC-20 tokens from one platform, converting them into another ERC-20 token on another platform, using the converted token to swap it with another ERC-20 token, and so forth.</div>
<p>Marius George Ciubotariu, Project Head at Hubble Protocol, explains the concept of composable DeFi, </p>
<p>“All DeFi dApps and protocols are Money Legos, because everything lives on an open global platform, without barriers, which means that you can pick whichever Lego piece you want, combine it with another piece, and build your own masterpiece. There is no limit to what you can create. All of this to serve every kind of financial appetite on the entire risk/return spectrum.  We, at Hubble Protocol, are also using the composability feature of smart contracts to build our yield-bearing stablecoin that can be collateralized with a basket of assets on the Solana blockchain, enabling capital efficiency with yield accumulation.”</p>

<preview>A composable token is an ERC-998 token, a standard extension to any non-fungible token, adding the ability for non-fungible tokens to own other non-fungible (ERC-721) and fungible (ERC-20) to</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Non-Fungible Composable Token? </h2>
<div>In general, the ERC-998 token is similar to the ERC-721 token — both are non-fungible. However, ERC-998 tokens are “composable,” meaning they allow users to “compose” or “organize assets into complex hierarchies” and trade them with single ownership.</div>
<div>The non-fungible composable token, ERC-998, can represent more than one digital collectible/asset, be it a group of ERC-20 tokens, a collection of unique ERC-721 tokens, a mix of both, or another ERC-998 token. Furthermore, it allows non-fungible tokens to own or be owned by other ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens.</div>
<p>Simply put, a non-fungible composable token is a portfolio or bundle of digital assets. These bundles can include any type of tokens, including art/game/sport NFTs, regular ERC-20 tokens, crypto derivatives, and more. The ERC-998 token powers a series of new use cases, primarily because it allows several components to connect to generate one umbrella asset. This can help users compose trees of connected ERC721 tokens and enable them to sell or buy batches of ERC721 tokens in a single transfer. </p>
<p>Here is an example to help you better understand the concept of composable tokens. Let’s say that you have 10 ERC-721 tokens, each representing unique digital coins. If you want to sell them, you’ll need to accomplish this on a one-by-one basis. But with composability functionality, you can transfer ownership of all of the 10 ERC-721 tokens to a single parent token. Once done, the parent token owns all the other tokens, allowing you to sell the entire lot at once.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to building composable tokens: </p>
<div>Top-Down Composable - In this scenario, the composable token stores information about its child tokens. Any ERC-721 token can be transferred into a top-down composable token. Think of this approach as a container for ERC-721 tokens. You can store and transfer the tokens in and out of it. You can fill the “container” with as many individual ERC-721 tokens as you want, then trade or transfer the composable as a whole. </div>
<div>Bottom-Up Composable - In this scenario, the bottom-up composable tokens store information about the parent tokens. Bottom-up composables can attach themselves as child tokens to other ERC-721 tokens. For instance, you can attach a whole bunch of bottom-up composables to an ERC-721 token and simply transfer it to someone else. By design, the new owner will now have access to all individual composables that are part of the ERC-721 token.</div>

<file>concentrated-liquidity.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Concentrated liquidity refers to the ability for liquidity providers (LPs) to select a particular range along the price curve to provide liquidity.</preview>
<description>
<div>Written by Yenwen Feng, co-founder of Perpetual Protocol.</div>
<div>Yenwen Feng is a cryptocurrency and technology professional with vast experience as a CEO and co-founder of several startups. Since 2004, Yenwen founded Decore (Stripe Atlas fMessengeror Crypto Companies), Cinch Network (Decentralized Derivatives), Cubie Messenger (Mobile , 500 Startups B5, 10M downloads), Gamelet, and Willmobile (Top mobile financial service app in Taiwan, acquired by Systex). Since 2019, Yenwen is co-founder of Perpetual Protocol.</div>
<p>First introduced by Uniswap v3, concentrated liquidity aims to boost capital efficiency, and to make up for the inadequacy of the original x*y = k formula underlying the standard automated market maker model. Within the new model, liquidity can be allocated to a price interval, resulting in what is called a concentrated liquidity position. LPs can open as many positions in the pool as they wish, thereby creating unique price curves aligned with their personal view of the market using what are known as range orders. </p>
<p>Concentrating liquidity around the current price, as well as updating custom positions according to the price changes, is an effective strategy that is aimed at maximizing gains while exposing far less capital to the risk of asset devaluation. The tighter the range that is set for a concentrated liquidity position, the greater fee revenue you will earn, and vice versa. LPs can still select to provide liquidity across the entire curve, but they will not earn as much trading fees as compared to selecting a smaller range of prices.</p>
<p>As the price fluctuates, liquidity from different LPs is used to execute the swaps. Consequently, users are making trades against the aggregated liquidity from all liquidity positions covering the current price, and it makes no difference to takers whose liquidity their swaps are consuming.</p>

<title>Confirmation</title>

<file>confirmation.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>In cryptocurrency, a confirmation is a measure of how many blocks have actually passed since a transaction was added to a blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Confirmation?</h2>
<p>Confirmation is something that essentially provides proof that something is indeed true. Think of this as when you receive confirmation that your Uber ride will arrive on time, or that you find out that something you thought might have happened, has actually happened.</p>
<p>Confirmation is essentially a verification or final proof of something. </p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, confirmation is a measure of how many blocks have actually passed since a transaction was added to a coin's blockchain. The more confirmations that have occurred, the more secure the transaction actually is.</p>
<p>When it comes to smaller transactions, buyers and sellers can agree to wait for zero transactions, while for larger transactions parties could potentially want to wait for more blocks.</p>
<p>When we discuss Bitcoin specifically, three blocks are a good safe middle ground for confirmations, while six confirmations are advised when it comes to larger transactions, and for every large transaction, you might wait for 60 confirmations. </p>
<p>Each merchant, as well as the exchange, has to decide how many confirmations they require for each coin. There is no specified number when it comes to this, and the number of confirmations that have to be 100% safe increases over time. </p>
<p>When it comes to the length, it depends on the coin itself, as each coin has a different time frame for how quickly the blocks can be mined.</p>
<p>With Bitcoin, a block is added about every 10 minutes or so. This means that there will be one confirmation every 10 minutes, which starts once an unconfirmed transaction is added to the blockchain itself.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that an unconfirmed transaction is one that is waiting to be added to the blockchain by miners. Each block is then added after that initial block and results in one confirmation. This means that if one confirmation takes 10 minutes, six could take an hour, and so on.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A cryptocurrency transaction is considered confirmed when it is included in a block on the blockchain. Each new block after the first one is an additional confirmation for that transaction.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Confirmations?</h2>
<div>Since there is no central authority to facilitate transactions in cryptocurrencies, they are instead processed by the network at large, or, more specifically, by the miners, who compile new transactions into blocks, secure them via the proof-of-work algorithm and add them to the blockchain.</div>
<div>Before a transaction (TX) can be recorded on the blockchain, it needs to be signaled to the network. Transactions that have been requested by users but have not yet been picked up by any miner and put into a new block are considered unconfirmed and are collected in the mempool — the backlog of all currently unconfirmed TXs.</div>
<div>As soon as an unconfirmed transaction does make it into a newly mined block, it receives one confirmation, or, in other words, becomes confirmed. After that, every new block that gets added to the chain becomes an additional confirmation for said transaction. So, for example, if a TX was confirmed in block number 656307 and the current block height is 656312, it has six confirmations.</div>
<p>The number of confirmations is important for security reasons: if a hacker wants to attack the blockchain by feeding it false transaction data, they need to break the security of each individual block in strict order, starting from the latest one in the chain. The more blocks have been mined since a particular transaction took place, the harder it is for a hacker to break through all of them and reverse that transaction.</p>
<div>Because of this, most crypto businesses that process customer transactions, such as wallets and exchanges, require at least three confirmations (or more, depending on their policy) before accepting a TX as truly valid and irreversible.</div>

<title>Consensus</title>

<file>consensus.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Consensus is achieved when all participants of the network agree on the order and content of the blocks in the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Consensus?</h2>
<div>In centrally organized systems, all decisions are made by a single center of authority. For example, all companies use a centralized accounting ledger to record all economic transactions that the business engages in. This ledger is traditionally managed by the accounting department, which is the sole entity in charge of maintaining and updating the entries.</div>
<div>On the other hand, in decentralized systems, which are composed of a multitude of distributed, independent actors with the same or similar levels of authority over the rest of the network, decisions are made collectively.</div>
<div>Blockchain, which in essence is a distributed ledger of transactions, is updated by individual miners with no central authority to provide oversight and ensure the correctness of entries.</div>
<div>Thus, a need arises for consensus over the precise state of the network at any given time. Achieving this consensus among numerous nodes trying to cooperate remotely is a non-trivial task, especially when it is exacerbated by the likely scenario of an unknown number of nodes malfunctioning or deliberately acting against the network’s interests, as demonstrated by the Byzantine Generals’ Problem.</div>
<div>Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies employ technical solutions such as the proof-of-work and proof-of-stake algorithms to ensure that network consensus over which exact transactions took place and when can be maintained without relying on central enforcement of the rules.</div>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A consensus mechanism is an underlying technology behind the main functionalities of all blockchain technology, which makes them an essential operating feature of all cryptocurrencies.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Consensus Mechanism?</h2>
<div>Over the past thirty years, consensus mechanisms have become an important part of the integration of computer processing into our everyday lives. Today, consensus mechanisms create the backbone of the whole cryptocurrency industry, as they are the foundational concept behind all blockchains. </div>
<div>A consensus mechanism represents the underlying principles of block verification in the blockchain. Consensus mechanisms outline the conditions that need to be met by nodes and validators so that new blocks can be added to the blockchain. There are numerous different consensus mechanisms, and all of them serve as the theorem behind the main characteristics of blockchain technology: a decentralized, distributed, public ledger.</div>
<div>Proof-of-work (PoW) is the first blockchain consensus mechanism created. It was introduced with the conception of the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin inspired developers to start tinkering with blockchain technology, and new consensus mechanisms began emerging. Today, some of the most well-recognized consensus mechanisms include Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) and VeChain’s proof-of-authority (PoA). All of these different consensus mechanisms place the importance on a selected requirement (work, stake, authority) in order to ensure agreement and allow transaction validation and block creation. </div>
<p>Consensus mechanisms are an essential requirement for the proper functioning of any blockchain protocol. They ensure that all nodes work in agreement, and the whole network of distributed node operators adhere to the same conditions and rules. Consensus mechanisms also ensure the security of users of the blockchain. Node validators are responsible for weeding out invalid transactions, and this action is successfully achieved through the predefined rules set out in the consensus mechanism. Not only that, for a transaction to be successfully registered on the ledger and added to a block, consensus needs to be achieved between all nodes. The equal distribution of responsibility across node operators ensures that the consensus mechanism continues to function successfully, even in the event of one or more nodes failing to accomplish their tasks.</p>
<p>In essence, consensus mechanisms secure the underlying principles of blockchain technology and allow for the distributed management and validation of numerous transactions in a matter of seconds. It is no easy feat to create a working and applicable consensus mechanism; however, with the rise of blockchain technology, developers undertake more innovative approaches. </p>
<div>The technology behind consensus mechanisms is based on a theoretical problem outlined by computer scientists in 1982. The Byzantine Generals' Problem asks whether it is possible to form a consensus in a computer network composed of independent, geographically distributed nodes, and consensus mechanisms present the answer. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Consortium Blockchain?</h2>
<div>Consortium blockchains are created and used by groups of corporations when they want to enjoy the advantages in exchanging value and information offered by a distributed ledger but find public, permissionless blockchains inadequate for any reason.</div>
<p>Consortium blockchains can be considered an intermediate step between public and private blockchains.</p>
<div>Public blockchains are the original and most widespread kind: the largest cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), belong to this type. They have a permissionless, decentralized nature: anyone can access their networks and become an equal-rights participant if they chose to do so.</div>
<div>Private blockchains, on the other hand, are designed by corporations to be used exclusively within their own organization. They do not allow any outside agents access to their networks and are managed in a centralized manner.</div>
<div>Consortium blockchains occupy the middle ground between these two types. They are designed collectively by groups of companies that want to use a common decentralized network that no entity outside of the consortium can gain access to.</div>
<p>Consortium blockchains enjoy a certain degree of decentralization over private blockchains, as all companies in the network are independent and can collaborate as equals, with no single node being able to force its will on others.</p>
<p>At the same time, they restrict access from outside of the consortium, protecting sensitive corporate data and reducing the load placed on the network by large numbers of nodes that otherwise might have decided to participate in it.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Consumer Price Index (CPI)?</h2>
<div>Primarily speaking, a Consumer Price Index (or CPI) is a type of index where the prices of a basket of goods and services are tracked to gain insights into market segments. CPI is designed to track the prices of consumer goods and services that the average consumer is expected to spend on and should be able to afford. It is a benchmark for measuring economic developments, specifically the impact of inflation or deflation. This is essential as governments can gather insights on their monetary policy decisions and thereafter tweak how much should be given to those with subsidized incomes.</div>
<p>But beyond measuring the effectiveness of the central government’s economic policy, the CPI also gives businesses and citizens information about the price changes in the economy, which then helps them make informed decisions. The CPI statistics cover a wide range of individuals, including professionals, self-employed, the unemployed, and more. Some of the major groups of the CPI include housing, apparel, education, and communication. While the CPI is mostly effective, it often fails to capture regional variations in prices, and it also assumes that all buying patterns are homogenous.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>In traditional finance, a contract is a binding agreement between two parties. In cryptocurrencies, smart contracts execute functions on the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<p>Contracts have been a huge part of the interactions between people since the dawn of time. While centuries ago, contracts were predominantly agreed upon in speech only, today, this binding agreement often takes the form of a written or electronic document.</p>
<p>The main purpose of a contract is to denote that person or company A has agreed to have some form of financial dealing with person or company B. For example, if you want to purchase a new house, you will have to sign a contract with the current owner or the bank selling the home. In this case, the contract agreement will detail the purchase price for the property, as well as the time when ownership switches hands, and any other relevant details. When you start a new job, you also sign a contract detailing your work responsibilities and task and the remuneration you will receive for completing them. </p>
<div>Essentially, contracts are an official, binding way to note down an agreement between two parties. In cryptocurrencies, contracts take on a whole new meaning. There are several important types of contracts when it comes to crypto and the blockchain. </div>
<div>Smart contracts are the essence of any blockchain. Thanks to them, all transactions and operations on a blockchain can happen anonymously. Smart contracts are self-executing computer programs with the terms of the buyer’s and seller’s agreement directly embedded into lines of code. The program, along with the agreement it contains, is distributed across a decentralized blockchain network.</div>
<div>Mining contracts are another important form of contract used by blockchain-based systems. Essentially, mining contracts allow users and crypto enthusiasts to mine tokens via utilizing cloud storage. These contracts transfer the mining capacities required to the cloud service, facilitating the mining process without requiring physical storage. </div>
<p>Contracts are an integral part of the global economy. Whatever form they take, without the binding force contracts offer, agreements between parties would have been impossible. We interact with various forms of contracts on a daily basis. We’re essentially signing a contract even when we accept the terms and agreements to use a website or service. </p>
<div>Without the concept of a contract, cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance wouldn’t have come into existence. Thanks to this concept and its improved application from a technological standpoint, blockchains can function the way they do. In this sense, contracts are among the fundamental components of all distributed ledgers and blockchain-based applications we can currently use. </div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A contract account is an account that has a crypto balance and associated code.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Contract Account?</h2>
<p>When a contract is accepted by contractors, a separate account is then opened for each contract in order to bring together all of the costs that relate to a particular contract, and a serial number is given to the contract which is known and addressed to as a contract account. </p>
<p>All expenses that incur on an account of a contract, such as materials, wages, cost of sub-contracts and so on are debited to a contract account.</p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, a contract account is one that has an Ether (crypto) balance and has associated code, where code execution is triggered by transactions or messages which are received from other contracts. When executed, they can also perform operations of arbitrary complexity, and manipulate their own persistent storage, which can have its own permanent state and call other contracts.</p>
<p>This is due to the fact that all of the action on the Ethereum blockchain sets in motion through the transactions fired from externally owned accounts. As such, every time a contract account receives a transaction, the code it has is executed as instructed by the input parameters which were sent as part of the transaction itself. The contract code is then executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine on each one of the nodes that participate in the network as part of their verification of new blocks.</p>
<p>This execution, however, needs to be deterministic, and its only context is the position of the block within the blockchain as well as all of the data which is available. The blocks on the blockchain then represent units of time, where the blockchain is a temporal dimension and represents the entire history of the states as well as the discrete-time point which were designed by the blocks within the chain itself.</p>

<title>Contract for Difference (CFD)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/contract-for-difference-cfd</url>
<file>contract-for-difference-cfd.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A contract for difference (CFD) outlines a buyer’s obligation to pay any price difference that might occur due to the shifting valuation of an asset.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Contract for Difference (CFD)?</h2>
<div>A contract for difference (CFD) is an important financial instrument that allows investors to protect themselves from serious fluctuations in the valuation of assets they are selling. In our modern economy, the prices of assets are quite volatile. In order to protect sellers from losing money during the documental preparations for a sale, buyers and sellers usually sign a contract for difference. </div>
<div>A CFD essentially ensures that the seller will receive payment for the value of the asset at the time of the agreement, even if the actual sale happens months after that because of documentary and administrative procedures. While all relevant documents are prepared, the price of this asset might decrease, thus robbing the seller of the initial gain they were expecting. Certificate for difference prevents sellers in such a scenario. </div>
<div>When signing a CFD, the buyer agrees to pay a set price for the asset regardless of any future fluctuations. In essence, the buyer agrees that they will cover any price difference between the amount agreed in the CFD and the actual price of the asset at the time of the sale. </div>
<div>As our financial world develops rapidly, CFDs entered the cryptocurrency space. This is not at all surprising, considering the high level of volatility cryptocurrencies can go through on a daily basis. With a CFD, a crypto seller is guaranteed that they will receive payment for the agreed price, even if ten minutes later the value of the said crypto token falls significantly. </div>
<div>On the other hand, contracts for difference can turn out to be a very profitable investment mechanism as well. When signing a CFD the buyer and seller essentially agree on a price they are both happy with. However, if at the time of the sale the value for the given token increases, the buyer ends up buying cheaper tokens than the market price. In essence, he is already making a profit, because of the CFD.</div>
<h2>CFD in the Crypto Space</h2>
<div>It is crucial to point out that CFDs in the crypto world carry a significant amount of risk. Essentially, if the seller profits, the buyer has to pay more than the market price for a token. Conversely, if the buyer profits, the seller gets less than the market price for the tokens they are selling. In this sense, CDFs might be considered a perpetual losing bet, depending on whose point of view you assume. </div>

<title>Coordinator</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/coordinator</url>
<file>coordinator.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>In blockchain technology, a coordinator is a specialized client that allows nodes to verify the validity of their copy of the ledger against specific transactions.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Coordinator?</h2>
<div>Blockchains are essentially a complicated series of transactions kept in a distributed ledger. A decentralized network of validator nodes then verifies this ledger. While this is the most simplistic way to look at a blockchain, there are numerous other elements of its functionality. Additionally, every blockchain is different. For example, the core functionalities of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain might be the same. However, they have very different applications.</div>
<div>In blockchain technology, a coordinator performs the function of a tracking and checking system for validator nodes. The coordinator issues milestones throughout a given amount of time. These milestones are essentially transactions recorded on the blockchain that validator nodes use in order to verify that their copy of the ledger is correct. It is important to note that not all blockchains feature a coordinator client.</div>
<div>A good example of a blockchain that used a coordinator client for ledger verification is IOTA. The IOTA blockchain depended on this coordinator client in order to add a secondary level of security and ensure the validity of all copies of the distributed ledger. However, the IOTA foundation has now implemented the next step in its roadmap, and the coordinator client is completely eradicated from the system.</div>
<div>It is not surprising that IOTA took that next step. Many blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe that coordinators hinder the decentralized power of the technology. As they essentially have a concentrated power to influence all copies of the ledger in the network simultaneously, they are regarded as a centralization feature. In this sense, blockchains that have a coordinator client cannot be fully decentralized. </div>
<div>Decentralization is at the heart of blockchain technology in terms of ideology, so a centralizing factor is not a desirable feature. This is why IOTA, for example, only relied on its coordinator in the very beginning. The goal of implementing such a client was to allow the developers enough time to work on the system while ensuring it was secure from the very beginning. </div>
<div>Nowadays, as blockchain technology grows and develops, new consensus mechanisms come to life. These make it easier for blockchains to be fully decentralized. If we continue with the IOTA example, the network now relies solely on its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for transaction verification and node validation. In this sense, coordinator clients might not be a viable security solution for much longer. Even so, for projects that are just starting out, or ones that actually prefer a level of centralization in the blockchain, a coordinator client can be a helpful way to ensure the security of the whole network. </div>

<preview>A core crypto wallet is able to contain the entire blockchain, rather than just a piece of a blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Core Wallet?</h2>
<div>A core wallet has the ability to contain the entire blockchain instead of just a piece of it, and allows users to both receive, store and send digital money, alongside the program on or with it. For example, Bitcoin transactions are kept on a digital ledger known as a blockchain which is maintained by a multitude of computers across the globe. This digital record is ever-growing, and a wallet is a software that interacts with the network of recordings and lets users receive, store and even send their digital money.</div>
<p>To get a deeper understanding of this, we have to look at Bitcoin Core, which is a full Bitcoin client and builds the backbone of the entirety of the network. Bitcoin Core also offers high levels of security, as well as privacy and stability. It has fewer features and takes a lot of space and memory by comparison though.  </p>
<div>Bitcoin Core is a wallet for storing Bitcoins. This is a full node of the blockchain network, and it is considered to be “heavy” — this implies that in order to run the wallet on your computer, you are required to download the entire chain to your computer. The full wallet synchronization takes several days to complete. It is an open-source application and can be easily downloaded.</div>
<p>The application is intended for serious crypto enthusiasts who want to support the community and are interested in the technical aspects of the network itself. The wallet allows you to hold Bitcoin, alongside sending them as well as receiving them. Only one address can be connected to the application, and it is a one-time process.</p>

<preview>A corporate treasury is formed to manage and control the liquidity, risk, funds, capital reserves, and other resources of a company to align with its short and long-term strategies.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Corporate Treasury?</h2>
<div>Corporate treasuries are in charge of a company's cash reserves. They serve as financial risk managers who seek to protect a company's value from the risks it faces regularly due to the nature of its business. Additionally, treasurers manage company cash reserves to ensure liquidity, risk, funding, proper capital allocation, and resources in line with the company's strategic goals. </div>
<div>To better manage a company's liquidity, the tools utilized are the balance sheet size and asset and liability liquidity. This ensures sufficient liquidity to engage in operations, such as takeovers, and derive the maximum possible return on cash reserves.</div>
<p>Corporate treasurers also have to oversee the execution of company-wide strategies, reporting back to C suites on the viability of buying a business or expanding into new territories. They may be tasked with finding the money if the C suite decides, whether through asset liquidation, stock issue, or reserves.</p>
<div>Lastly, corporate treasuries are also tasked with managing risks. These risks may relate to interest rates, credit, currency, commodities, or the company's operations. The most common ones are related to liquidity, credit, and currency.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A correction is a pullback of an asset’s price of at least 10% to adjust for over-valuation.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Correction?</h2>
<p>There is no strict definition of a correction, but it is commonly used to describe a rapid decrease of at least 10% in the price of an asset from a recently achieved peak. It is called a correction because it usually returns the price from an abnormal surge to its long-term established trend.</p>
<div>Corrections are usually followed by recoveries, but they may also lead to more prolonged periods of decline called bear markets when prices can drop by 20% or more. For example, according to the data of the financial services company Charles Schwab, there were 24 corrections in the S&amp;P 500 stock market index during the period from November 1974 to February 2020, only five of which have resulted in bear markets.</div>
<div>In the cryptocurrency market, corrections of 5-10% are significantly more frequent than in the stock and other traditional markets, owing to its characteristically high volatility. However, they tend to be balanced out by similarly frequent recoveries, and the overall trend of most major coins since the inception of the market in 2009 has been a bullish one.</div>
<div>As an example, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price grew from as little as $0.003 per coin in 2010 to more than $19,000 in 2020, despite at times suffering corrections of as much as 50% in the span of a single day.</div>

<file>cpu-miner.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Since mining requires computing power, the process of generating or mining cryptocurrency using a central processing unit (CPU) is called CPU mining (or central processing unit mining).</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a CPU Miner?</h2>
<div>As the name suggests, CPU miner is a software program that is used for cryptocurrency mining on a processor or CPU. Some cryptocurrencies require the use of a central processing unit (CPU) for mining along with the relevant software programs.  </div>
<div>There are different software programs out there offering a wide variety of features. Miners have two options available: either to do solo mining or join a mining pool to increase their chances of getting rewards. It is highly recommended to join a pool where you can mine with other people and share profits.</div>
<h2>How Does CPU Mining Work?</h2>
<p>CPU mining is the process of using a computer to perform complex calculations on blocks of data that keep the blockchain network running. In simple terms, it involves a computer repeatedly running hashing functions until the correct result is found. The miner receives a reward in the form of coins for each block of data.</p>
<p>Miners are required to solve complex computations using their hardware in order to get rewarded. Since the competition is high, it is beneficial for participants to use efficient tools. This is where GPU mining comes in. </p>
<h2>CPU, GPU, and ASIC Mining </h2>
<div>During the earlier years of cryptocurrency, only CPU mining was available to users. However, since mining crypto, especially BTC, has become more difficult than before, miners have shifted their focus to GPU and Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) mining. Moreover, after each halving, the BTC rewards are reduced by 50%. Therefore, it is beneficial to use more mining rigs than just a few.</div>
<p>One of the main differences between CPU and GPU mining is that GPUs are able to complete blocks faster than a CPU. While CPUs have been able to mine profitably in the past (for example, during the early days of Bitcoin), the rise in difficulty level has made it challenging to mine profitably with a CPU, even if you have free electricity.</p>

<title>Craig Wright</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/craig-wright</url>
<file>craig-wright.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Craig Wright is an Australian computer scientist associated with Bitcoin SV.</preview>
<description>
<h2>Who Is Craig Wright?</h2>
<div>Craig Steven Wright is an Australian computer scientist who had gained both popularity and notoriety in the cryptocurrency space after claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Monikered as “Faketoshi” by some members of the industry, Craig Wright is responsible for the emergence of Bitcoin SV (BSV), a hard fork of BCH, after leading a new faction of the Bitcoin Cash community to acrimoniously split from the original project due to technical differences.</div>
<div>The Bitcoin SV software was intended to increase the Bitcoin Cash blockchain’s block size limit to 128 MB, which was also supported by billionaire entrepreneur Calvin Ayre. In Mar. 16, 2021, BSV’s block size was reported to have reached 638 MB.</div>
<div>Wright currently works as a chief scientist at nChain Inc., a company that provides enterprise blockchain solutions powered by the Bitcoin SV blockchain. </div>
<p>According to his own website, Wright is said to be one of the earliest minds behind what we now know as blockchain technology, as well as the world's first online casino.</p>
<p>Wright has worked in IT and security, describing himself on LinkedIn as a senior management executive information security specialist. He has also acted as chief scientist at blockchain developer nChain, CEO of technology firm Hotwire PE and director of many other companies.</p>
<p>According to Wright, he had direct involvement in the creation of Bitcoin, with the assistance of his late friend, computer forensics professional Dave Kleiman.</p>
<p>In July 2015, Wright divested his office holdings and left his position as director at a number of companies. Shortly after, in December 2015, WIRED and Gizmodo publications reported that Wright may be the inventor of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In 2015, Wright had presented a collection of cached documents and blog posts that have since been erased from the internet, as pieces of evidence supporting his claim.</p>
<div>Wright’s announcement was later supported by former Bitcoin lead developer Gavin Andresen, who believed that Wright was the real Satoshi after he met Wright at a hotel in London in 2016. Wright is said to have validly signed a message to Andresen with his initials and private key from one of the first 50 Bitcoin blocks mined claimed by Nakamoto.</div>
<p>Wright also signed a message using Bitcoin’s first and ninth blocks according to Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matoni.</p>
<div>The evidence included leaked unverified transcripts from an interview with the Australian Tax Office surrounding his tax affairs in 2014, documents revealing his involvement with the Bitcoin project, and emails delivered from addresses linked to Nakamoto that lobbied for Bitcoin as well as one sent to Wright’s lawyer, Clayton Utz, signed off as “Craig (possibly)”.</div>
<p>The transcripts quoted Wright saying: “I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009.”</p>
<p>Gizmodo and WIRED also stated that Wright's PGP keys were created in 2009 and could be traced back to Satoshi Nakamoto's email address. These claims were backed by investigations by the BBC and The Economist in 2016, which reported that Wright had digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys created during Bitcoin's early development.</p>
<div>However, by and large, most prominent figures in the crypto community such as Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Lightning Network co-inventor Joseph Poon do not recognize Wright’s proofs as valid and have spoken about the illogicality of his technical commentaries. Vitalik Buterin even went as far as to call him a “fraud.”</div>
<p>Wright's claims have also been disputed by security researcher Dan Kaminsky who said that Wright’s private key was invalid, as it had simply extracted data reusing an old signature from a Bitcoin transaction performed in 2009 by Satoshi.</p>
<p>Vice Media’s Jordan Pearson and Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai also reported that Wright’s PGP keys from 2009 can be backdated and fixed to point to anyone's email address.</p>
<div>In Andrew O'Hagan’s book, The Secret Life: Three True Stories, published in June 2016, Wright said he provided an invalid private key rather than the original Satoshi Nakamoto PGP private key because of legal obligations agreed in a Seychelles trust fund signed by David Kleiman who passed away in 2013.</div>
<p>WIRED’s report stated that the trust fund is held through Wright’s company, Tulip Trading, which is speculated to control 1.1 million Bitcoin held by Nakamoto.</p>
<div>While the mystery of Nakamoto continues, Wright maintains his claims by using UK libel law to sue those who call him a fraud, including Vitalik Buterin, the founder of cryptocurrency Ethereum. </div>
<div>This litigious behavior has created an industry backlash against him and Bitcoin SV, with several industries delisting BSV in 2019 after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao singled him out as the reason the exchange was removing BSV from its platform.</div>

<preview>Craig Wright is an Australian computer scientist that has publicly claimed to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.</preview>
<description>
<div>There are many theories on who is behind the creation of Bitcoin and the mysterious pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. One person in particular claims that he was the creator all along — Craig Wright. Fifty-year-old Craig Steven Wright is an Australian computer scientist who has worked in an IT capacity for several high-profile companies as well as the Australian Securities Exchange.</div>
<p>In 2015, Wright was the subject of a piece by Wired magazine that outed him as a possible inventor of Bitcoin. After Wired released this information, Wright’s Australian home was raided by federal police, who later claimed that the Australian Taxation Office ordered the raid.</p>
<p>Wright has since claimed that he is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto, and there is some cryptographic evidence to back this. Digital messages with Wright’s name are allegedly linked to early blocks of data that Bitcoin’s founder had mined. However, many have reported that this is a hoax, and Wright grafted these signatures by reusing Satoshi’s original.</p>
<p>Wright claims that he created Bitcoin in a group effort along with cryptographers Dave Klieman and Hal Finney (who created the first proof-of-work algorithm before Bitcoin). It is quite possible that these three could have created the first cryptocurrency based on their combined skillsets. However, many consider Wright’s involvement in Bitcoin’s creation to be a hoax.</p>
<p>Despite making the claims that he is behind the pseudonym Satoshi, Wright has not come forth with any clarifying evidence. Although Wright is an exceedingly interesting person, the hunt for the real Satoshi Nakamoto is still in effect.</p>

<title>Credit Rating</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/credit-rating</url>
<file>credit-rating.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Credit rating is a measure that allows banks and lending institutions to predict how capable you are of repaying your debt.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Credit Rating?</h2>
<div>A credit rating is one of the most important tools banks and lending institutions have in their arsenal when determining whether a borrower is capable of repaying a loan. Depending on the country you live in and the institution you are looking to borrow from, your credit rating might be comprised of different statistics. Importantly, credit ratings can be applied to companies as well. In essence, any entity that is looking to borrow money from a bank or other institutional lender has a credit rating. </div>
<h2>What Is a Credit Rating Agency?</h2>
<div>As credit ratings play an important role when banks decide whether to grant a loan. This practice has now turned into a business venture. Credit rating agencies are companies created to specifically analyze customers’ spendings and credit history to prepare their credit rating. Some companies focus on evaluating credit scores for individuals, while others focus on assessing the credit rating of big companies, national banks, and even countries. </div>
<h2>How to Calculate A Credit Rating?</h2>
<p>Personal credit scores are calculated based on a number of factors. Most importantly, credit rating agencies take into account your settled debt, your current outstanding debt, and how well you have been paying it, as well as your monthly income. Additionally, your homeowner status plays an important role. If you own your home but have a mortgage for it, this might affect your credit rating. </p>
<h2>Types of Credit Rating</h2>
<div>There can be a short-term credit rating, as well as a long-term credit rating, depending on the type of credit or loan you're looking to take. Your short-term credit rating</div>
<p>determines the likelihood of you getting credit for a smaller amount and fewer repayment installments. Your long-term credit rating estimates whether you'll be able to pay a bigger credit for a longer period of time.</p>
<div>The global credit rating industry, which evaluates the credit scores for governments, is predominantly ruled by three major companies - Moody's, S&amp;P Global, and Fitch Ratings. These three companies take into account the current economic situation in countries and evaluate their suitability to take on more national debt.</div>
<h2>Importance of Credit Rating</h2>
<div>Having a good credit rating is of utmost importance as your score determines the condition of your future loan. If your credit rating is in good standing, you will be more likely to get a loan with favorable interest rates and APR. Unfortunately, if your credit rating is not that good, you might be declined a loan or offered one with a significantly higher interest rate. </div>

<preview>Crest risk is the number representing the possibility that a bank or lending institution will lose money because a borrower cannot repay their loan.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Credit Risk?</h2>
<div>Credit risk is an internal calculation performed by banks and lending institutions before a borrower is granted credit. Credit risk is calculated for all types of loans, including individual loans, enterprise loans, and even national debt. </div>
<div>It is important for lending institutions to mitigate the risk of defaulting borrowers as much as possible. Considering this, credit risk is one of their most valuable tools. In consumer financing, credit risk is calculated based on the five Cs’: credit history, capacity to repay, capital, lending conditions, and collateral. The combination of these factors associated with an application will determine the credit risk for a given loan. For example, if you have a good credit history, and collateral presented for the loan, but you don’t have any starting capital, your credit risk score might become higher. </div>
<div>The correlation between these five factors is determined by complex algorithms and financial calculations. However, it is important to know what is taken into account when your credit risk is measured. </div>
<div>For example, if a person with high credit risk goes to a traditional lender, they might be declined a mortgage. However, as the percentage of people with subpar credit ratings is growing, there are lending institutions that cater to high-risk borrowers. Subprime mortgage lenders offer mortgage loans to customers with fairly bad credit scores. However, it is important to note that subprime mortgages often have significantly inflated interest rates and APR terms. </div>
<p>The risk of defaulting borrowers is one of the things banks and lending institutions pay utmost attention to. There are usually dedicated credit risk management departments within these institutions. The credit risk management department is responsible for calculating the individual credit risk score for new borrowers. Additionally, these departments are in charge of creating risk assessments for the combined loan value of the bank or lending institution. It is important that banks maintain a relatively low level of risk exposure. </p>
<div>While credit risk is still widely new in the cryptocurrency sphere, some principles of risk calculation from traditional finance have already found their place in the crypto world. For example, many crypto lenders are now turning to collateral as a way to ensure that their investment is relatively protected. </div>
<p>Risk management and risk-aversion are among the most important of the protection mechanisms banks have in place when lending money.</p>

<preview>Cross-margin mode allows traders to open multiple positions using their account balance as a common pool of collateral.</preview>
<description>
<div>Written by Yenwen Feng, co-founder of Perpetual Protocol.</div>
<div>Yenwen Feng is a cryptocurrency and technology professional with vast experience as a CEO and co-founder of several startups. Since 2004, Yenwen founded Decore (Stripe Atlas fMessengeror Crypto Companies), Cinch Network (Decentralized Derivatives), Cubie Messenger (Mobile , 500 Startups B5, 10M downloads), Gamelet, and Willmobile (Top mobile financial service app in Taiwan, acquired by Systex). Since 2019, Yenwen is co-founder of Perpetual Protocol.</div>
<p>Cross Margin, also known as &quot;Spread Margin&quot; is a margin method that utilizes the full amount of funds in the available balance to avoid liquidations. Any realized profit &amp; loss statement (P&amp;L) from other positions can aid in adding margin on a losing position.</p>
<p>Cross margin means that the user’s funds are kept in one pool and all of their positions then use this pool as collateral. This makes managing collateral easier since the user doesn’t need to add or remove margin for each position. But importantly, this has to be used with caution as in this particular model, the P&amp;L for one position affects all other positions.</p>
<p>In the event where the user has several highly leveraged positions, one position that goes against the user can cause others to be at risk and face possible liquidations. If you have just one position, then you’ll lose all your margin when liquidated. If you have more than one position, you'll lose a proportion of your margin based on the largest position.</p>
<p>For example, with an account balance of $10,000, cross-margining allows traders to open several positions using these funds as collateral. However, if you have an open position and then enter another position in a different market, the liquidation price of your positions will be affected since the margin used for these positions comes from the same balance (in contrast to isolated margin). Depending on your risk tolerance and trading style, cross-margin may be more suitable, e.g., if you want to hedge against your positions or engage in pair trading.</p>

<p>Cross-border trading in financial markets and trade finance represents the opportunity to trade globally, across international markets, using a local currency and oftentimes against a local counterparty. With respect to global markets, cross-border trading offers several benefits for investors seeking to capture unique trades, like capitalizing on pricing discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities. </p>
<p>In the early days of crypto trading, traders in different countries couldn’t participate in the markets available in other countries. For instance, if you had an account at a U.S.-based crypto exchange, you could only trade in BTC/USD. However, with the advent of cross-border trading platforms, you can easily participate in other countries’ markets, accessing the local currency’s liquidity, such as BTC/JPY, BTC/EUR and more. </p>
<p>Cross-border trading allows traders to access major spot trading pairs available across licensed countries. Suppose your exchange follows the international regulatory standards and complies with each country’s local KYC and anti-money laundering laws. In that case, you’ll be able to trade in these international markets using their local currency against foreign counterparties with just one local trading account. You won’t need to go through several different sign-up processes or register on dozens of other exchanges, avoiding unwanted hassles and delays, and most importantly, the risk of getting your onboarding application denied if you don’t reside in the local jurisdiction</p>
<p>Cross-border trading is a straightforward process where a crypto exchange provider acquires licenses to operate in several countries while following the financial regulations of each country.</p>
<p>Cross-border trading creates a truly global crypto trading platform, allowing registered users across countries to benefit from the single marketplace’s scalability, depth and liquidity. Traders can sign-up for the exchange and access liquidity pools and spot trading pairs of all licensed countries.</p>
<p>With cross-border trading, you can stake your fiat currency in global trading marketplaces and benefit from the minimal spread between the crypto’s buy and sell prices while being subjected to your native country’s privacy policies and financial regulations. </p>
<p>In addition to the ability to access global markets, cross-border trading also offers several other unique benefits, including:</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Cross-Chain?</h2>
<div>Cross-chain is a technology that enhances the interconnection between blockchain networks by allowing the exchange of information and value. In doing so, it breaks the siloed nature of blockchains to create an intertwined distributed ecosystem. </div>
<div>Notably, a cross-chain operates independently from the connected platforms, hence, it doesn’t inherit the shortcomings of its interfaced networks. Inter-blockchain technology aims at eradicating intermediaries when moving value between decentralized networks, enabling users to interact with other blockchains seamlessly.</div>
<div>Leading cross-chain projects include Polkadot, Blocknet, Cosmos and Wanchain, each of which focuses on a different aspect of interoperability. For example, Polkadot aims at enhancing the sharing of smart contract data between distributed platforms while Blocknet puts more effort into a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating between blockchains.</div>
<p>Furthermore, Wanchain sees a future where all digital assets live on a single network while Cosmos provides a base that supports other blockchains using zones connecting to a central protocol called the Hub.</p>
<div>Some industries that require cross-chain technology include decentralized finance (DeFi) and healthcare. In the DeFi scene, inter-blockchain connectivity enables token swaps between different networks, fostering interoperability, which is crucial for financial ecosystems to thrive. </div>
<p>Cross-chain technology also allows users to overcome common trade-offs among distributed platforms and tap into the benefits of various consensus mechanisms so they could get the best of all worlds. </p>
<div>Furthermore, in the healthcare sector, cross-chain systems promote data ownership, security through encryption, efficiency, and transparency.</div>

<title>Cross-Chain Communication</title>

<file>cross-chain-communication.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Cross-chain communication between blockchains allows different protocols to verify data and transactions without the intervention of a centralized third-party service.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Cross-Chain Communication?</h2>
<div>Cross-chain communication between different blockchains is essential in guaranteeing the decentralized functionality of the technology. As blockchain projects ultimately have very different structures, sometimes it might be impossible to exchange data between chains without additional software or third-party intervention. This is why cross-chain communication methods are becoming increasingly sought after. At the moment, there are several cross-chain communication processes for blockchains to exchange information.</div>
<div>Atomic swaps are probably the most popular cross-chain communication tool for blockchain developers. Unlike purchasing cryptocurrency from an exchange, an atomic swap allows peers to transfer tokens wallet-to-wallet through a dedicated smart contract. This process eliminates the necessity of a third-party exchange and allows peers to exchange cryptocurrency directly. </div>
<p>Stateless Simplified Payment Verification (SVP) is another blockchain cross-chain communication tool. This tool allows blockchains to estimate the validity of transactions without having to store all information regarding the transaction. This process enables blockchains to communicate without having to exchange great amounts of data between each other. </p>
<div>Other cross-chain communication tools include merged consensus connections, relays and chain federations. All these communication processes involve different levels of monetary involvement. Not only that, the best approach for cross-chain communication is usually determined by the underlying characteristics of the two blockchains involved. For example, the lightning network is operating exclusively on the principle of atomic swaps. However, because of the widely varying nature of blockchain-based systems, atomic swaps are not always the best choice to ensure cross-chain communication.</div>
<p>Interoperability is one of the major points of focus for blockchain developers, as this is one of the features predominantly missing in current blockchain systems. While blockchain bridges are one way to ensure interoperability, cross-chain communication tools also help to progress towards more functional ecosystems. </p>
<div>The lack of cross-chain communications between different systems at the moment inhibits blockchains from performing at their highest capacity. The more these processes develop, the more applications and implementations will open up before blockchain developers. Not only that, cryptocurrency users will be able to benefit from increased transaction processing speeds and easy exchanges between different tokens instantly. Cross-chain communication still has a long way to go; however, there has been considerable progress in this aspect of blockchain technology. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Crowdfunding?</h2>
<p>Crowdfunding is the process through which one can raise money in order to finance both projects as well as businesses. Crowdfunding enables fundraisers to collect money from a large number of people through a variety of different platforms, usually online.</p>
<p>In other words, crowdfunding is a technology-enabled financial service that covers a wide range of ways through which one can raise money. This is done with a large number of capital givers throughout different online crowdfunding platforms which serve the role of intermediaries, and instead of raising finance from traditional funding sources such as banks, mutual funds or business angels, funds are raised through “crowds.”</p>
<p>The benefits crowdfunders get in return for their investment or the money they put into these projects depends on what kind of crowdfunding model is being used in order to raise the funds in the first place. As compensation for their financial risk, they can receive a tangible reward or an intangible reward. </p>
<p>However, in many cases, the funds raised are provided as a donation most of the time. Keep in mind that there is investment crowdfunding as well as non-investment crowdfunding. This distinction highlights the difference between when the funders act as investors who aim to achieve an economic return, and when the funders support a charitable project or receive rewards that are non-monetary.</p>
<p>Based on the rights of the funders in the specific project, crowdfunding can be categorized into different models.</p>
<p>In the investment model, you have debt-based crowdfunding and equity-based crowdfunding.</p>
<p>In the non-investment model, you have reward-based crowdfunding and donation-based crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that there are many different models, the definitions of crowdfunding can be limited; however, there are different definitions when it comes to its elements.</p>
<p>A great number of funders are involved in the financing, and an online platform facilitates as well as promotes the contact between the providers are those seeking capital. Then, there is an open call to participate in the financing.</p>

<title>Crowdloan</title>

<file>crowdloan.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>The practice of new projects to raise funds through DOT or KSM tokens for slots on Kusama or Polkadot network.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Crowdloan?</h2>
<div>In the crypto world, most projects use Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as their funding method during their initial stages. In this scenario, investors make decisions based on the credibility of the team, whitepaper, and the community. The problem with the ICOs model is that it does not offer any guarantee of success. Polkadot has fixed this issue by offering the feature of crowdloans.</div>
<div>Crowdloans are a part of Polkadot's substrate framework and allow the development of parachains to generate $DOT and earn a spot in the parachain auctions.</div>
<div>Before any parachain slot auction takes place, there is a specific timeline dedicated to the crowdloan. This is where teams can borrow $DOT from members of the community for auctions. As a user, you do not give your $DOT to the team, instead, you give them to the relay chain for the project.</div>
<p>After gathering funds, the project submits a bid that uses the $DOT received from the crowdloan. The investors' $DOT are locked for the term determined by the parachain lease (usually six months to a maximum of two years) if the project gets the parachain slot. The $DOTs are returned to the investors at the conclusion of the lease. The team never gets possession of the investors' $DOTs/$KSMs in this process.</p>
<p>For ICOs, the concept of crowdloan is a game-changer. Investors must be rewarded for bonding tokens on behalf of the teams. The project's native coin has proven to be the most popular reward so far. As a result, investors can lock their $DOT in a 2-year parachain lease on behalf of Acala and earn $ACA tokens.</p>
<p>Projects usually have no motivation to seek a crowdloan unless they are certain that they can harness it to generate an economic return because the tokens used for crowdloaning parachain auctions are never in their possession.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional way of exchanging tokens for new project tokens, the crowdloan technique protects investors’ money while providing them an opportunity to earn additional tokens on a potential project. </p>
<p>No matter what happens to the project, investors can always recover the $DOTs after the parachain lease expires. As a result, investors may join in any crowdloan with confidence, knowing that their primary tokens are safe and not dependent on the success of the project.</p>
<div>Crowdloans are a fascinating new addition to the blockchain sector that assists teams in securing parachain spaces. Also, the platform ensures that the invested tokens are protected as the projects never get access to them. This measure also helps to screen the quality of teams seeking crowdloans.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A crypto debit card is a type of debit card that allows its holder to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Crypto Debit Card?</h2>
<div>A crypto debit card is a type of debit card that allows its holder to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Most crypto debit cards in use today are powered by Visa and MasterCard, which enables global support for the card.</div>
<div>Users need to first top up their crypto debit cards with their preferred cryptocurrencies before they can use them for shopping, similar to how traditional debit cards work. Loading a crypto card is facilitated via supported websites and mobile applications. </div>
<p>Interestingly, merchants get to receive payments in fiat currencies like EUR or USD despite being paid with a crypto card since the card issuer facilitates the conversion using prevailing market rates. </p>
<p>While the conversion equates the card to a conventional debit card, it provides additional benefits to cryptocurrency holders, especially if they travel overseas regularly. When traveling abroad, crypto cardholders can avoid the high transaction fees incurred when switching between currencies. In addition, a crypto debit card also exempts users from other charges levied on legacy cards such as yearly fees. </p>
<p>Other advantages of using a crypto debit card include the ability to make ATM withdrawals, as well as interface with popular payment platforms such as Samsung Pay, Google Pay, and Apple Pay. Note that there are virtual crypto debit cards ideal for online purchases.</p>
<p>In addition, some crypto card providers offer users the ability to stake native coins to unlock rewards. However, loaded virtual currencies regularly fluctuate in value due to crypto market’s volatility. </p>
<div>Regulated issuers may also require users to reveal some personal details as part of their know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.</div>

<title>Crypto Invoicing</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/crypto-invoicing</url>
<file>crypto-invoicing.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Crypto invoicing is the process of creating invoices for goods and services that need to be paid in cryptocurrencies.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Crypto Invoicing?</h2>
<p>Crypto invoicing allows you to create different itemized bills and invoices for the products or services you offer. It enables you to bill clients in crypto via email, without the hassle of switching between wallets and apps.</p>
<p>As cryptocurrencies continue to occupy the headlines, a greater share of the population now owns small sums of various popular tokens. This pickup in crypto adoption is seeing many businesses and individuals warming up to the idea of accepting cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services. </p>
<p>But user-friendliness continues to be a barrier to accepting crypto payments. Unlike fiat payment gateways or retail point-of-sale systems, the sender has to meticulously copy the long string of hexadecimal numbers of the recipient’s wallet address. It is also difficult to properly document the counterparty information and consideration for each transaction like businesses can with traditional invoices. This often makes bookkeeping in crypto an administrative nightmare for accounting and tax purposes.</p>
<p>The ability to send, receive, and pay invoices easily with crypto will be one of the key drivers of crypto becoming a widely-accepted payment method. With a crypto invoicing tool, you can easily create, manage, track, and review all requested crypto payments from your customers. A predesigned yet fully customizable template allows you to fill in all the required information quickly and easily. You can then forward it to your customers as a link (or attachment) via email, social media, or text message. </p>
<p>Once the recipient clicks on the link, they will see the itemized bill and the requested amount. The crypto invoicing tool scans the blockchain explorer and notifies both parties when the payment has been made to your digital wallet.</p>
<h2>The Market for Crypto Invoicing</h2>
<div>Cryptocurrencies are quickly becoming a growing share of the global payments market. Several prominent payment companies like Paypal, Venmo, Visa, and Mastercard have already partnered with crypto businesses to enable users to purchase their favorite items from millions of retail stores globally using their digital assets. Request Finance’s own data from over $150 million crypto invoices shows that nearly half were paid in stablecoins, like DAI or USDT.</div>
<div>Mainstream businesses like McDonald’s, Starbucks, AMC, Pizza Hut, and many more, have also started accepting crypto payments. Freelancers, professionals, sports personalities, artists, and even politicians, are warming up to the idea of accepting crypto payments. Moreover, countries, like El Salvador, have already accepted Bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender, with many other countries exploring the use of stablecoins or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</div>
<p>Crypto invoicing is becoming an increasingly important tool amidst changing financial preferences. Some benefits of adding crypto invoicing to your accounts department include:</p>
<p>Generates invoices quickly and easily</p>
<p>Allows you to customize the invoice as per your brand standards fully</p>
<p>Avoids human error in sending and receiving payments</p>
<p>Allows quick, secure, and cheap payments processing (thanks to blockchain technology)</p>
<p>Allows you to manage, review, and track all of your invoices </p>
<p>Increases business opportunities as customers these days prefer paying via crypto</p>

<h2>What Is a Crypto Loan?</h2>
<div>A crypto loan is a type of secured loan, similar to an auto or student loan, in which you commit to an asset as collateral in order to secure financing. In this case, cryptocurrency is the asset offered to a lender in exchange for cash.These crypto-backed loans are secured loans that use digital assets, like Bitcoin, as collateral. The loans are usually paid out in stablecoins, which the borrower pays back over time. </div>
<p>With crypto loans, lenders (usually other users) lend cryptocurrencies to different users (borrowers) who are people looking to borrow cryptocurrency. In return for providing capital for borrowers, lenders receive interest payments.</p>
<div>Some crypto lending platforms are custodial — manage funds and approve transactions on behalf of their users. Others are non-custodial — with users managing their own funds and approving transactions themselves from personal own software wallets or hardware wallets.</div>
<div>Crypto lending allows users to take full advantage of crypto investing as the value increases the longer you hold onto your cryptocurrency without selling them. Another advantage to crypto loans is how fast the loan transaction takes place. Unlike traditional finance loans, there is no credit check or any qualification process involved so the platform distributes funds instantly. The loan amount is based on the collateral asset’s value, and some crypto lenders will allow borrowers to receive a loan worth up to 50% of their collateral value.</div>
<div>But, there is of course a large risk factor, as the crypto markets are extremely volatile. With huge wins come huge liquidation losses. There are also margin calls where users might find themselves in a situation where they have to add extra collateral to avoid liquidation. Depending on the platform you're using, certain cryptocurrencies might not be eligible for loans, so you might have to first exchange one cryptocurrency for another.</div>
<p>Crypto loans are distributed through a few steps. The borrower goes to request a crypto loan through a platform and selects a loan amount and loan term. Then, the borrower stakes the crypto collateral before the loan provider pays out the loan. </p>
<div>The crypto lender will fund the loan and collect the interest as payments. Once the borrower pays off the entire crypto loan, the crypto lending platform will send the collateral back. </div>
<div>Some of the most innovative crypto lending platforms include Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, and SmartFi.</div>

<title>Crypto Winter</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/crypto-winter</url>
<file>crypto-winter.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Crypto winter is a period in the crypto market when prices of major coins fall dramatically from all-time highs.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Crypto Winter?  </h2>
<div>The term “crypto winter” was coined after the 2018 cryptocurrency crash by Eugene Etsebeth, a venture capitalist. It generally refers to a period in which the cryptocurrency market performs poorly, significantly influencing investor mentality. The term is comparable to a bear market in the stock market. There have been several crypto winters in the past, one being the crash that the market witnessed in early 2018. In such a situation, the majority of cryptocurrencies are affected. There is a possibility for exceptions in a bear market where some coins show exemplary performance. Due to the extreme price volatility, it is impossible to accurately  predict when a crypto winter will begin and end. </div>
<p>A crypto winter could be triggered by many factors, including regulatory change, lack of demand, increased difficulty and accumulation of unsustainable highs. However, the top three occurrences that lead to a crypto winter are market crashes, exchange hacks/breakdowns and overregulation by governments. </p>
<p>Market crashes happen sporadically and have a tremendous impact on the price of coins. The ideal way to avoid countering a market crash is to identify its root causes to prevent future surprises. </p>
<div>Exchange hacks and government policy changes are common, impacting the stability of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), decentralized exchanges (DEX) and coin prices. Most hacks usually result in the loss of millions of dollars and, sometimes, even bankruptcy. On the contrary, policy changes affect not just exchanges, but even users. Some of the most common policy changes are bans on cryptocurrency trading or freezes on related payments. </div>
<h2>When Does Crypto Winter Start?</h2>
<p>The previous crypto winter began in January 2018 and lasted until December 2020. Looking at the past for direction, we can see that a crypto winter behaves like a traditional bear market. In the long-term, weak startups are weeded out while allowing stronger companies to grow and prove the strengths of their products.</p>
<div>A crypto winter usually starts when there is a steep sell-off from the previous all-time high of Bitcoin. The last ATH of BTC was in November 2021 when the price hit $68,000. After that, prices started to trend downwards. In mid-June 2022, the price dipped by nearly 70%.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Crypto Winter Vs Bear Market</div>
<p>A bear market is said to take place when the price of financial assets decreases continually. Most financial experts agree that a 20% or more price drop is considered “bearish.” </p>
<p></p>
<p>A bear market is also often characterized by irrationality and pessimism, leading to prices falling even further. Bear markets can continue on for a few weeks or several months. In the traditional financial markets, bear markets have been known to last for as long as 20 years. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Within the crypto world, a crypto winter refers to a season when financial assets are frozen or do not appreciate. During this time, crypto-assets do not have far-reaching appeal and are not in demand or seen as valuable assets. Crypto winters are usually witnessed between two bull cycles, when the initial wide-eyed excitement regarding the crypto markets dies down. </p>

<file>cryptoasset.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A cryptoasset is any digital asset that uses cryptographic technologies to maintain its operation as a currency or decentralized application.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Cryptoasset?</h2>
<div>Cryptoassets leverage cryptography, consensus algorithms, distributed ledgers, peer-to-peer technology and/or smart contracts to function as a store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account, or decentralized application (DApp). There are four most common types of cryptoassets: cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, security tokens and stablecoins.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrencies are the most widespread of these: the two largest assets by market capitalization on the crypto market, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), belong to this class. </div>
<div>Cryptocurrencies are coins, i.e. fully independent assets, that can be transacted between the participants of their networks and use the blockchain technology to function. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions that have ever been made with a particular cryptocurrency, which is maintained and updated via the use of a consensus mechanism, such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.</div>
<div>Utility tokens are not coins in the strict sense of the word, as they do not run on their own blockchain. However, they still use the blockchain of the parent platform they are based on, like Ethereum or EOS (EOS). Utility tokens are called so because they can be used to access a specific product or a service; for example, Storj (STORJ) allows one to pay for using decentralized storage space on its network. Utility tokens can still be used as a means of exchange, but that is not their primary purpose.</div>
<div>Security tokens are cryptoassets that derive their value from other assets, both physical and digital, that can be traded. These tokens are subject to security regulations like those enforced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</div>
<div>Finally, stablecoins are a type of cryptoasset whose price is pegged to that of a traditional currency, like the USD or EUR. Examples of stablecoins include Tether (USDT) and DAI (DAI).</div>

<preview>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptographic technologies to secure their operation.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<div>The concept of a digital currency secured by cryptography has existed since at least as early as 1983 when American cryptographer David Chaum introduced ecash. However, the first cryptocurrency to truly achieve mainstream recognition was Bitcoin (BTC), which launched in January 2009.</div>
<div>Bitcoin’s main innovation was the use of blockchain — a distributed, cryptographically secured ledger of all BTC transactions that have ever taken place. The use of the blockchain allows the Bitcoin network — which consists of numerous independent nodes all of which choose to participate on a voluntary basis — to effectively function without requiring a central authority, like a bank, to enforce the rules.</div>
<div>Bitcoin’s blockchain is maintained and updated through the use of the proof-of-work — a computationally intensive consensus algorithm based on cryptographic hash functions, which ensures that no new Bitcoin can be created without spending considerable effort and that all BTC transactions are faithfully and permanently recorded.</div>
<p>Bitcoin’s appearance inspired further growth of the cryptocurrency industry, which by 2020 consists of tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies of various types, collectively worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<div>Some of those are, similarly to Bitcoin, fully decentralized proof-of-work coins, such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) or Monero (XMR). Others use different consensus algorithms, such as Tron (TRX), Tezos (XTZ) or Dash (DASH), which all use proof-of-stake. Others still are based on private blockchains that are operated by companies for internal use and are inaccessible to the general public. But all of them have at least one thing in common: the operation of their networks is secured by cryptographic algorithms.</div>

<title>Cryptocurrency Money Laundering</title>

<preview>Cryptocurrency money laundering is a method criminals use to legitimize and enshroud funds by changing fiat to digital currency and then routing it through many pathways. It is an attempt to</preview>
<description>
<div>Talk of the risks of cryptocurrency-enabled money laundering has become commonplace as part of the FUD that still plagues Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Money laundering is often a talking point for governments and traditional financial institutions whenever the topic of cryptocurrency rises (in addition to the crypto market’s volatility and sustainability problems associated with mining). </div>
<div>Politicians and mainstream economists often see crypto as a potential vehicle for money laundering, tax evasion and other illicit activities. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Reserve, and regulatory bodies around the world critique decentralized cryptocurrencies for their perceived lack of traceability and accountability. However, as many criminals have come to find, using Bitcoin to launder dirty money is a very bad idea. </div>
<div>Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin transactions are neither anonymous nor undetectable. In fact, transactions on the blockchain leave an extremely tidy and accurate account of which funds went where, creating a big problem for those who don’t want to be traced. The hacker group DarkSide quickly discovered this after ransoming the Colonial Pipeline. Not only was the FBI able to trace the transactions to wallets containing 63 Bitcoins,  they were also able to access the wallet and extract the coins it contained using its private key. How exactly they were able to do this remains a controversial issue but the fact remains that crypto is no place to hide – especially with so much attention focused on the industry at present. </div>
<h2>Bitcoin Money Laundering</h2>
<div>In its early days, when governments and regulatory agencies were less savvy, Bitcoin was indeed used by some criminals for the purposes of money laundering. In 2020, the U.S. government seized $1 billion worth of Bitcoin from the Silk Road network, where individuals had used Bitcoin to buy illegal goods and launder millions of dollars. </div>
<div>Such cases have led most countries to tighten their anti-money laundering law (AML) regulations for crypto. Governments have also hit many crypto-related organizations hard with obligatory compliance measures, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) rules, to help prevent illicit activities. Since it is very difficult to buy crypto outside of an exchange, governments are able to track crypto funds by keeping tabs on the money that passes through popular brokerages like Coinbase. </div>
<p>Some actors with criminal intent have tried to use Bitcoin to shuffle funds around in an attempt to obfuscate the trail of illicit money. Once they have acquired crypto, they swap and exchange between cryptocurrencies multiple times in a bid to make it harder to trace their moves in a sea of transactions. Upon exchanging their funds back into fiat, money launderers then disguise their proceeds as capital gains or other profits from trading on the crypto market. However, as crypto becomes more widely accepted as a means of payment, users – launderers included – may in fact not always need to exchange their crypto back into fiat currency. </p>
<p>The UN estimates that $1.6 trillion is laundered each year – close to 3% of global GDP. It is uncertain how much Bitcoin- and crypto-enabled laundering as a whole contributes to this figure. However, even if it were a couple of billion dollars per year, it pales in comparison to other money laundering methods. </p>
<h2>What Are Privacy Coins? </h2>
<div>Bitcoin isn’t the only player in crypto money laundering, of course. Some cryptocurrencies are tailored to provide more anonymity, security and privacy, and are therefore much easier to use for illicit activities – although that is not their original purpose. Known as privacy coins, these assets are seen as only slightly more problematic than Bitcoin from the perspective of AML regulators. Ninety percent of illicit activity and money laundering on the dark web still occurs using Bitcoin addresses. </div>
<div>Monero is one of the best-known privacy coins. Monero prides itself on being a secure and untraceable currency. It was created in an attempt to establish one of the few totally private networks out there, which could provide users with complete control over who can see their activity. Monero is currently ranked the 26th-largest coin by market capitalization and the coin is listed on most major exchanges. </div>
<div>Zcash is another contender for the privacy coin crown. It facilitates private transactions within an inauditable platform. The network verifies transactions on the Zcash blockchain using zero-knowledge proofs. These proofs make it possible to transact without revealing any information about the sender, receiver, or transaction amount.</div>
<div>Grin is another digital currency that strives to provide “electronic transactions for all without censorship or restrictions.” It is an open source network that developers can use to implement new privacy tools (for example, the signature “mimblewimble”) that can delete past transaction data from the blockchain without posing a threat to the network’s security. </div>
<h2>Bitcoin Taxes</h2>
<div>As regards taxation, many countries are still working to establish the best way to classify both the cryptocurrencies themselves and any proceeds gained from trading Bitcoin and other digital assets. Bitcoin is also frequently blamed for tax evasion attempts. Now that crypto is becoming more widely adopted, agencies like the IRS and SEC are introducing capital gains taxes on crypto profits and subjecting crypto-denominated salaries to income tax.</div>
<div>Governments worldwide are also establishing new regulations for crypto miners and traders as the industry grows. Companies – both within and outside the crypto industry – will not be spared scrutiny from the SEC, as more of them add Bitcoin and other cryptos on their balance sheets. Within the industry, crypto exchanges are coming under increasing pressure to provide more protections against crypto tax avoidance.</div>
<h2>Regulated Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<div>Regulated crypto exchanges are those that are compliant with all crypto-related laws in their jurisdiction and are subject to formal regulatory oversight. Each country has its own laws for digital currencies, and some are more friendly than others towards decentralized finance. Regulated exchanges with SEC approval in the U.S. include Coinbase, Binance.US, Gemini and Kraken. Thanks, in part, to the good reputation this regulatory approval confers, they have gained most of the market share in the country.</div>
<p>These exchanges often offer a more reliable and trustworthy service as they need to meet the requirements and protections established by the U.S. government. Among other measures, they must comply with all anti-money laundering and KYC rules to prevent criminal activities.</p>
<h2>Unregulated Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<div>There are some crypto exchanges that don’t require customers to pass through KYC checks. However, even these platforms may still adhere to  some of the regulations established by governments. Binance.com (not Binance.US), Bybit and Nominex are just a few examples of exchanges that do not require their customers to undergo KYC checks.</div>
<div>In addition to these centralized, unregulated exchanges, there are a host of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that are unregulated. These exchanges usually will not have a centralized entity that can be held accountable, though that doesn’t mean activity on them will go unwatched. </div>

<title>Cryptocurrency Pairs</title>

<file>cryptocurrency-pairs.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Exchanges utilize cryptocurrency pairs in order to facilitate the trade between different tokens.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Cryptocurrency Pairs?</h2>
<div>A cryptocurrency pair is essentially a comparison of the prices of two crypto tokens. The most popular cryptocurrency pair is ETH/BTC. In this cryptocurrency trading pair, you can find how much one Ethereum token is worth in Bitcoin. In other words, trading pairs represent how much of one token you can purchase with a given amount of a different token. </div>
<div>Much like traditional currency trading, cryptocurrency exchanges rely on crypto trading pairs to illustrate each token’s value. When cryptocurrencies were first introduced as a financial alternative, there weren’t many trading pairs available. Most of the trades were tied to Bitcoin, as this is the major cryptocurrency token. Today, with the abundance of altcoins on the market, new trading pairs emerge by the hour. </div>
<p>Cryptocurrency trading pairs allow investors to make smart decisions about the transactions they want to accomplish through an exchange. As more pairs become available, traders have a larger variety of transactions they can perform. In order to successfully exchange one cryptocurrency token for another, you either need to find an exchange that supports that trading pair, or you will need to perform several transactions between different pairs in order to reach the final result you are looking for. </p>
<div>In this sense, trading pairs represent the availability of different trading options on a given exchange. In a hypothetical scenario, a trader is looking to exchange Litecoin (LTC) for Polkadot (DOT), however, the exchange they are using does not support that trading pair. This means that the trader will first have to trade LTC for Bitcoin and then exchange that amount of Bitcoin for DOT. Unfortunately, in this scenario, the trader will have to pay more in taxes and fees, as he has to perform two different transactions. If the exchange supported a LTC/DOT trading pair, the trader would have achieved the end result in a single transaction. </div>
<p>Cryptocurrency trading pairs are an essential part of the crypto economy, as they allow for the easy swap of one token for another. Crypto exchanges have become aware of the need to support as many crypto pairs as possible in order to meet the needs of traders. In addition, certain crypto trading pairs may offer better trading conditions in terms of fees and taxes. While unpopular trading pairs between altcoins usually incur more significant trading fees, the most sought-after crypto trading pairs have proven themselves to be a better deal. However, correlations between different cryptocurrencies may sometimes result in more profitable trading pairs for altcoins. Considering this, it is important to research and take note of the fees and taxes associated with each trading pair that might be of interest. </p>

<title>Cryptographic Hash Function</title>

<file>cryptographic-hash-function.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Cryptographic hash functions produce a fixed-size hash value from a variable-size transaction input.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Cryptographic Hash Function?</h2>
<div>A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm, i.e. a repeatable sequence of specific actions, that can be used to transform an arbitrary data string of a variable length into one of a fixed length and format, called the hash.</div>
<p>One of the simplest examples of a hash function is adding up the digits in a number until one is left with a single-digit output. If the input is 49, for example, then adding 4 and 9 yields 13, whose digits 1 and 3 are then summed up again to give the output of 4. Regardless of the length of the input number, the output will always be a single digit.</p>
<p>That is not a good algorithm, however, because, in order to perform its functions well, a hash function needs to possess several characteristics:</p>
<p>Hash functions are applied in many use cases, for example, as checksums to verify the integrity of computer files after their transmission of prolonged storage, or in randomizing functions.</p>
<div>They are also a key component in the mining of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), which uses the SHA-256 hash function. In order to add a new block to the blockchain and claim their reward of newly-mined Bitcoin, miners first need to produce a hash value that is below a certain threshold, called the target.</div>
<p>The fact that hashes are pseudorandom and it is impossible to predict an output of any input before actually running it through the hash function ensures that miners cannot print new Bitcoins out of thin air and need to prove the work they have performed.</p>

<preview>A field of study and practice to secure information, preventing third parties from reading information to which they are not privy.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Cryptography?</h2>
<div>For a long period of history, cryptography dealt exclusively with the technique of ciphers — algorithms that were used to turn regular messages (called “plaintext” in cryptography) into ostensible gibberish (called “ciphertext”).</div>
<p>These messages could then be sent via letters, whereby the receiver would use an auxiliary piece of information (called “the key”) to decrypt the ciphertext back into readable plaintext. The information communicated this way was useless to any third-party adversaries without the knowledge of the key, even if the letter was physically intercepted — that is, until the development of cryptanalysis, the discipline that deals with cracking encryption algorithms.</p>
<p>The earliest types of ciphers, called substitution and transposition and known collectively as classical ciphers, could be both encrypted and decrypted by hand. This meant that they did not scramble the information enough to resist the methods of cryptanalysis available at the time.</p>
<p>The emergence of radio and, later, internet communications has made the need for strong encryption more acute than ever, as messages were now broadcast indiscriminately and could be intercepted at will.</p>
<p>Through the use of computers, new methods of plaintext scrambling became available that are effectively unbreakable: while in theory an advanced encryption algorithm can be deciphered without a key, it is infeasible to do so in a reasonable amount of time with the resources available to the adversaries.</p>
<div>Today, cryptography is a default in a lot of computer communication. Among its numerous applications are hash functions, like the SHA-256, which is used to secure the operation of the network of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.</div>

<title>Cryptojacking</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/crypto-jacking</url>
<file>crypto-jacking.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The use of another party’s computer to mine cryptocurrency without their consent.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Cryptojacking?</h2>
<div>Some cryptocurrencies are mineable, meaning that people can choose to expend their computational resources to secure the operation of the blockchain and earn newly created coins in exchange; the coins can later be traded on crypto exchanges for traditional currencies like USD. This requires the purchase, setup and maintenance of specialized equipment and significant expense of electrical power, all of which eat into the profit made from selling the mined coins.</div>
<div>Instead of participating in fair competition, an unscrupulous hacker may choose to mine cryptocurrency by hijacking the computational resources of other people, a practice known as cryptojacking.</div>
<p>Cryptojacking can be performed in multiple different ways, but there are two most popular ones. The first way is via a trojan — a malicious program that gets installed onto a computer without the owner’s knowledge or consent by, for example, clicking on an email link or attachment. The program then keeps running on the host computer, consuming its resources, while the profits go to the hacker.</p>
<p>The other popular option is the so-called “drive-by” cryptojacking, which is performed online via malicious JavaScript code on web pages that are either owned by the hackers outright or have been compromised by them.</p>
<p>Cryptojacking leads to increased consumption of its victims’ electrical power, slows down their computers and shortens the life of their equipment. If a user suspects that their computer might have been the target of a cryptojacking attack, they should look out for red flags: decreased performance and the overheating of their computer, which is usually coupled with more intense use of the cooling fan. Most modern antivirus software providers are acutely aware of the threat of cryptojacking, so they offer protection from it.</p>
<div>Cryptojacking is described as the unsolicited use of a person’s device or system, such as a computer, server, smartphone, tablet, etc., for crypto mining. Attackers can gain access to a victim’s device through emails, websites, or online ads that contain links to malicious software that will auto-execute when accessed.</div>
<div>There are two common types of cryptojacking: file-based and browser-based. </div>
<div>File-based cryptojacking involves hackers sending seemingly legitimate emails to their victims. But when users open the attachment, a program is executed and the crypto mining script is introduced to their computer.</div>
<p>In a browser-based cryptojacking attack, hackers typically embed malicious code in various websites. Once the victim accesses the infected websites, the crypto mining script immediately takes effect within that device.</p>
<p>Cryptojacking schemes can go unnoticed for a long time, allowing hackers to mine with total impunity from unsuspecting victims’ devices. Mining activities incur high electricity costs, which hackers pass on to their victims so they can earn token rewards without financial burden. </p>
<p>Cryptojacking scripts can cause devices to lag or even break down due to wear and tear.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a class of cryptojacking scripts that has a worming ability that allows it to replicate fast, infecting multiple devices and servers within a network. </p>
<div>Most cybercriminals tend to mine privacy coins like Monero as they are difficult to trace.</div>
<p>Some measures to avoid falling victim to cryptojacking schemes include the use of ad-blockers and anti-crypto mining extensions.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Cryptology?</h2>
<p>Cryptology is the scientific study of cryptography as well as cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>It is the mathematics, including the number theory, as well as the application of formulas and algorithms, that underpin cryptography and cryptanalysis to be more specific.</p>
<p>In order for the data to be secured for storage or even transmission, it has to be transformed in such a way that it can be difficult for an unauthorized person to actually be able and see the true meaning behind it. This is done through certain mathematical equations which are used and are difficult to solve unless specific criteria are met. The level of difficulty when it comes to solving these equations is referred to as intractability. These types of equations actually form the basis of cryptography.</p>
<p>Some of the most important ones include the discrete logarithm problem, the integer factorization problem and the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that much of the terminology when it comes to cryptology dates to a time when written messages were the only things that actually were required to be secured, the source information, even if it is an apparently incomprehensible system of 1s and 0s, is referred to as plaintext as a result of this.</p>
<p>The secret information known only to the legitimate users is the key, while the transformation of the plaintext under the control of the key into a cipher or ciphertext is the encryption. The process of decryption is the inverse operation, where a legitimate receiver recovers the concealed information from the cipher using the key.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is CryptoPunks?</h2>
<div>CryptoPunks is one of the most recognized NFT collectibles. Created by John Watkinson, Matt Hall, and Andy Milenius back in 2017, this collection is a set of 10,000 24x24 pixel images. </div>
<div>Each image represents a unique punk (alien, robot, ape, etc.) that can be purchased and owned by whoever possesses the asset on the blockchain. These punks are unique and many look like distinct celebrities. The non-fungible token world has seen significant growth over the past few years. This growth has been dominantly driven through the purchase and sale of NFTs on Ethereum which started with CryptoKitties in December 2017 and has since expanded to the millions of tokens that exist on the network today. </div>
<div>CryptoPunks were created with a similar purpose in mind; to show off what is possible with non-fungible tokens on Ethereum via ERC-721, just as CryptoKitties showed what you could do with ERC-20/ERC-233 reproducible tokens.</div>
<p>In 2021, CryptoPunks and NFT market as a whole experienced a massive surge in their values. Several NFTs were sold for $1 million each. The total transaction volume in the first six months of 2021 was $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>CryptoPunks remains one of the earliest NFTs – primarily a collection of pixelated avatars. It is currently the most sought-after NFT collection, with several NFTs being sold for millions of dollars. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, Larva Labs (the creator of CryptoPunks) released the collection for free – as an experiment. The two-person team behind CryptoPunks had no idea that this would go on to become the leading name in the NFT space. Back then, ERC-721, which is now a standard for NFTs, wasn’t even created. When Larva Labs released CryptoPunks, 9,000 of them were snatched by Ethereum wallet owners while others were held onto by Larva Labs.</p>

<preview>Currency is a medium of exchange that defines value.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Currency?</h2>
<p>Currency is a medium of exchange that defines value through reference to the geographical location of the authorities which are responsible for its maintenance. A currency, in its basic sense, is money in any form that is currently in circulation or used as a medium of exchange. This is specifically the case for banknotes as well as coins. Another definition of currency includes the system of money that is commonly used by people in a nation.</p>
<p>Currency is essentially the paper and coin money that a country uses in order to conduct business. An example of this would be The United States, which uses dollars, quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies. Aside from being used as a country’s monetary system, currency can also mean that something is accepted or used as a medium of exchange. </p>
<p>In the world of crypto, you will find that currencies are addressed in two ways:</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies – these are digital or virtual types of currencies that are secured through the usage of cryptography. This makes it nearly impossible for them to be counterfeited, or result in double-spending. Keep in mind that a lot of cryptocurrencies are based on decentralized network blockchain technology, which fills the role of a distributed ledger that is enforced by a network of computers across the entire globe.</p>
<p>Fiat currencies – fiat currencies, otherwise known as fiat money, is a government-issued currency that is not backed up by a commodity. Fiat money gives central banks a lot more control over the economy due to the fact that they have the ability to decide how much actually gets printed. Many modern paper currencies, including USD, EUR, or AUD are FIAT currencies.</p>

<file>currency-crisis.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A currency crisis is termed as a financial emergency in which a country's fiat currency loses value, and investors become cautious of retaining/investing in that country's assets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Currency Crisis?</h2>
<div>A currency crisis occurs when there is considerable concern over whether a country's central bank has adequate foreign exchange reserves to keep the country's currency stable. </div>
<div>A speculative attack on the foreign currency market frequently occurs in conjunction with a crisis. These are marketplaces where individuals can buy and sell currencies in the same way that they can buy and sell equities on the stock exchanges which might further depreciate the currency - also called the currency depreciation bubble. </div>
<div>In an event of devaluation, many people panic-sell the currency at rates way below what is acceptable, given the current situation, and the currency depreciates even more than it should.</div>
<div>Currency crises can be particularly damaging to small open economies or larger, but less stable countries. Governments frequently take up the responsibility of fighting off such attacks by utilizing their currency reserves or foreign reserves to meet the excess demand for a specific currency.</div>
<div>The reasons behind the cause of the currency crisis include inflation, political instability, the rise of debts, credit unbalancing, and other economic factors, such as the high volatility of currency exchange rates in a country's economy.</div>
<div>In some scenarios, ‘financial crisis’ is another term used for a currency crisis. Some popular examples of such a crisis include:</div>
<div>Interestingly, Bitcoin (BTC) was founded in November 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, 2 months after the Lehmann crisis. Satoshi believed Bitcoin to be a revolutionary currency that is completely decentralized. Therefore, it cannot be controlled by central banks, who can manipulate the price and break the trust of ordinary people. </div>
<div>Bitcoin was valued under $1 in 2010, however, a decade later in 2021, it hit an all-time high of $64,888.99. Since then, it has maintained its position as the biggest cryptocurrency in the world.</div>
<div>Although most cryptocurrencies are not part of any central or regulated system. like fiat currencies (prone to currency crisis), the high volatility surrounding them remains a major concern for investors.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Curve AMO?</h2>
<div>Curve is a software that uses multiple cryptocurrencies to operate an automated market maker (AMM) service focused on stablecoins (cryptocurrencies programmed to mimic other assets). It is an AMM platform that provides a highly efficient way to exchange tokens while maintaining low fees and low slippage by only accommodating liquidity pools made up of similarly behaving assets. While the approach does lead to lower prices for the liquidity providers who supply the pools with tokens, Curve has an incentive model which increases participation by integrating with external decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and delivering rewards in the form of Curve DAO (CRV) tokens and interest.</div>
<p>For example, in the case of FRAX, a fractional algorithmic stablecoin, the Curve AMO utilizes the stablecoin and USDC collateral to provide liquidity for the protocol and tighten the peg. This allows the Curve AMO controller to set and collect admin fees for the FRAX stablecoin holders and various future functions. The protocol can also move idle USDC collateral or new FRAX to its Curve pool to create even more liquidity and tighten the peg while earning trading revenue.</p>
<div>Author: Sam Kazemian is the Founder of Frax, the world’s first fractional algorithmic stablecoin that is partially backed by collateral and stabilized algorithmically. Frax is open-source and permissionless, bringing a truly trustless, scalable, and stable asset to the future of decentralized finance.

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Custodial cryptocurrency businesses are the ones that are in possession of their customers’ funds for the duration of the use of their services.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Custodial?</h2>
<div>Traditionally used in relation to cryptocurrency wallets or exchanges, a custodial setup is one in which private keys, which are required to access a customer’s funds, are held by the service provider while they offer a login account.</div>
<div>One of the defining characteristics of cryptocurrencies is the fact that they always remain under full control of their owners: every public address is associated with a private key that only the owner knows and without which no other person can access the funds stored on that address.</div>
<p>While this setup is one of the main selling points of crypto to some, others may consider the task of diligently managing their own keys not worth the advantages of keeping unconditional custody over their own funds. In this case, custodial wallets are available, which take over the management of a user’s private keys and allow them to access their funds via a simple and familiar login-password setup.</p>
<div>Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are another common type of custodial service. They allow customers to deposit cryptocurrency funds onto an exchange account and then trade them for other cryptos or fiat currencies. The trades are not recorded directly on the blockchain, but rather on the exchange’s internal balance sheet. Meanwhile, every customers’ funds are held in custody from the moment they are deposited to the moment they are finally withdrawn from the exchange.</div>
<div>While easy to use and efficient, these services are associated with custodial risks: by storing many customers’ funds in one place, they become a likely target for hackers, government censorship or simple accidents like hardware malfunctions.</div>

<preview>A custodian is responsible for safely holding assets for an institution or individual for a variety of purposes.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Custodian?</h2>
<div>A financial custodian is a business that holds your financial assets in its actual custody. For simplicity and protection, your money and assets are usually held by a brokerage firm, commercial bank, or a similar organization.</div>
<div>Financial custodians, often known as bank custodians, have physical authority over financial accounts, including checking, savings, money market, and 401(k) accounts. Your checks are made payable and deposited immediately to your custodian against your account number when you deposit funds to any type of account.</div>
<div>Custodians provide services such as transaction settlements, account management, dividend and interest payments collection, foreign exchange transactions, and tax help in addition to safeguarding securities. The costs charged vary depending on the services requested by clients. Some companies charge a quarterly fee depending on the total value of the assets in possession.</div>
<div>Companies that are considered as custodians are often huge and respected organizations that are in charge of the security of assets and securities worth millions or billions of dollars. A custodian can be designated to handle the assets of a minor child. Custodians are frequently used by investment advising companies to preserve the funds they manage for their customers.</div>
<div>A power of attorney can also provide a custodian the ability to claim custody of assets. That implies the custodian can make decisions on behalf of the customer, such as changing investments or paying bills.</div>
<div>The Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup are among the major custodian banks in the United States. Meanwhile, the Bank of China in Hong Kong, Credit Suisse and UBS in Switzerland, and Deutsche Bank in Germany are some of the most well-known custodians in the world.</div>
<div>In the world of blockchain, custodial services are often aimed at institutional investors with substantial cryptocurrency holdings. The exchanges that store cryptocurrency wallets for their consumers are called custodians in the crypto space. </div>
<div>Storing cryptocurrencies is different from saving fiat due to their physical vs digital nature. While banknotes can be saved and recovered from physical locations, such as a wallet or safe, digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are stored and retrieved via a blockchain. Cryptocurrency holders have no claim to actual money; rather, they possess the keys to blockchain addresses that reflect their cryptocurrency holdings. Digital custodians in cryptocurrency are the software, hardware, or hot wallets that are secured by a cryptocurrency exchange also known as a ‘‘Digital Asset Custodian’’.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrency custody solutions are self-contained security and storage systems designed to keep cryptocurrency assets safe. Their services are primarily aimed at institutional clients with substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Cryptocurrency custodians typically use a mix of hot and cold storage methods. </div>
<div>Even though the specialty is still in its infancy, competition is already increasing. Even though established solution providers control a major share of the market, new players who are just breaking into the sector and small financial firms are growing their operations in the industry. Some popular ones include BitGo, Coinbase Custody, and others. </div>

<preview>Custody is a financial institution's legal capacity to keep and preserve financial assets for its clients to avoid asset theft or loss.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Custody?</h2>
<div>In the financial world, custody can be termed as a safeguarding service provided by a financial institution for a customer's securities. The institution that provides custody is known as a custodian which gathers dividends, interest, and profits from security sales for a fee and redistributes funds according to the customer's instructions.</div>
<div>Custody has evolved from a personal relationship to a face-to-face encounter with a highly controlled institution. This gave birth to a new degree of financial complexity, further separating the secretive realm of banking from daily life.</div>
<p>Custodians that accept client funds now commit not just to retain the funds on behalf of the customer, but also to utilize the assets to lend them out for their gains.</p>
<div>Custodians play an important role in the financial ecosystem, from onboarding newbies to offering advanced trading tools to seasoned users. At the institutional level, there is an increase in the number of firms that handle asset storage and management, and some are also insured to repay their clients in the event of a financial loss.</div>
<div>Assets can be held in both digital and physical form by custodians. Custodial businesses are often very big and respected entities (like major banks) since they are in charge of preserving assets for a large number of customers that amount to millions or billions of dollars in most cases. </div>
<div>In the blockchain world, custodial solutions are usually provided by a third-party crypto exchange that holds the private keys of its cryptocurrency users in addition to the crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. </div>
<div>The custody of the cryptocurrencies is completely in control of the crypto exchanges that employ security solutions to keep the digital assets of their users safe from theft or unpredictable losses. In case of a hack or theft, the custodian (crypto exchange) is fully responsible for refunding their users. </div>
<div>A great example of this was the Binance hack of 2019, one of the major crypto hacks in history, where $40 million was stolen from its online wallets. In a reaction to this hack, the CEO of the world’s largest exchange, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao announced full refunds to the victims.</div>
<div>Custodians of crypto assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Terra, are known as crypto custody providers. Cryptocurrency custodians offer services to both institutions and individuals who wish to store and safeguard their digital assets in a user-friendly, secure, and compliant custodian platform. </div>
<div>Cryptocurrency custodians are a great way to store digital currencies, however, caution must still be practiced by users against any major hack that may take their funds away forever. According to experienced crypto investors, a major part of digital currency holdings should be held in cold storage if users aren't actively using it or don’t plan to use them in the near future. This practice is important to remain safe from hacking activities that may take place on a custodian platform.</div>

<h2>What Is a Cypherpunk?</h2>
<div>The practice of cryptography was limited to the militaries and spy agencies of the world until about the 1970s. In the 70s, the U.S. National Bureau of Standards, in cooperation with the National Security Agency, published the Data Encryption Standard, an encryption algorithm developed by IBM. In 1976, pioneering cryptographers Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published their New Directions in Cryptography paper.</div>
<div>Both publications brought cryptography to the attention of the general public, which led to the formation of Cypherpunks by the late 1980s — a movement of activists who advocated the use of cryptography by individuals to promote personal privacy and freedom/ In 1992, the Cypherpunks mailing list was started, reaching 700 subscribers by 1994, and as many as 2,000 by 1997.</div>
<p>In the mailing list, members discussed mathematics, cryptography, computer science, as well as had arguments on political and philosophical topics. The Cypherpunks were questioning the issues of government monitoring and corporate control of information about a decade before they became a public concern, thanks to whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. An average of 30 messages per day were transmitted on the list between 1996 and 1999.</p>
<div>One of the core notions of Cypherpunks is to realize good ideas, not just discuss them. As such, they have designed many cryptography-based privacy-focused applications that are still in widespread use today, like the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) program for secure data communication. Cypherpunk ideas and achievements have led to the creation of the Tor project for private web browsing and cryptocurrencies, the first of which was Bitcoin (BTC).</div>
<p>A number of well-known personalities in the crypto industry, like Nick Szabo and Adam Back, are members of the Cypherpunks.</p>

<h2>What Is Daedalus Wallet?</h2>
<p>Daedalus Wallet is a multi-platform, open-source, hierarchical-deterministic wallet that lets you generate an endless number of keys from a single seed.</p>
<div>It protects against security risks such as malware by using encrypted private keys and passwords.</div>
<p>Input-Output Hong Kong has officially released the Daedalus wallet, which can be used across several platforms. It allows for the secure storing and transfer of ADA coins across addresses. There are no restrictions on the user's geographical location, however, you should check to see whether dealing with cryptocurrencies is allowed in your country's legislation first.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<div>When you create a Daedalus wallet, it produces a 12-word seed phrase to guarantee that the wallet money can be retrieved by the rightful owner. It is additionally secured with a password, which must be entered each time money is sent out of the wallet.</div>
<div>Another security aspect of the wallet is the encryption of private keys, which ensures that cryptographic communications belong solely to the intended receiver, providing a better level of anonymity to the wallet's user base.</div>
<p>Daedalus is also a hierarchical-deterministic (HD) wallet, which means it produces a hierarchical structure of private/public addresses (or keys) for the user instead of requiring them to be generated manually.</p>
<p>HD Wallets generate all addresses from a single master seed, and each time this seed has a new counter value added, an endless number of new addresses may be created automatically based on the new seed.</p>

<preview>DAO summoning is the act of creating or forming a DAO.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is DAO Summoning?</h2>
<div>DAO summoning is the act of creating or forming a DAO. The term is typically used in the context of forming a new Moloch DAO, though it can also refer to the formation of any new DAO.</div>
<div>The first one to be summoned was MolochDAO, by Ameen Soleimani on February 14th, 2019 at ETHDenver. </div>
<p>All key infrastructure required for a new DAO can be deployed in a matter of seconds, and multiple tools already exist that make summoning a new one possible with just a few clicks. </p>
<p>The use of “summon” in the context of forming a new DAO is an expression of the urgency of calling on a community to form around a shared purpose or common values, as well as a dedication to the fundamental DAO ethos of distributed and collective ownership. In contrast, the formation of traditional companies and organizations – which are typically neither community-driven nor community-owned – is marked by more utilitarian terms like “create,” “start,” or “fund”. </p>
<p>DAO summoning also refers to the act of assembling new members in a new DAO. A “DAO summoner” calls on individuals to join the DAO, assembling the first cohort of members. </p>
<div>In the initial versions of the Moloch DAO framework, the DAO summoner was the only initial member of the new DAO, which led to the need for actively assembling new members. In 2.1 and later versions, a new DAO can be summoned with multiple other initial members; this is known as “multi-summoning.”</div>
<p>Author: Collectively authored by DAOhaus</p>
<p>DAOhaus is the home for purpose-driven community DAOs and has grown from a 2019 hackathon project into a fully-fledged platform with +1,000 DAOs. DAOhaus enables users to add the capabilities of DAOs to their own projects without having to worry about the complexities of writing smart contracts or building dApps.

<preview>A portion of the internet existing on darknets not indexed by search engines, that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations or authorizations.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Dark Web?</h2>
<p>The dark web is often confused with the deep web — the part of the web that is not indexed by the search engines and is thus not searchable. The dark web is a smaller subsection of the deep web that requires special software to host and visit web pages on it.</p>
<div>Specially designed networks are required to access the dark web, such as Tor (The Onion Routing), which provides anonymous access, and I2P (The Invisible Internet Project), which allows the anonymous hosting of websites.</div>
<p>The layered encryption of the dark web, which routes communications through large numbers of volunteer nodes, with each new node adding an extra layer of encryption, ensures that the identities and locations of users are not revealed to anyone. Both the visitors and the hosts of dark web pages are unable to obtain any personal information about each other, allowing them to communicate in complete confidentiality.</p>
<p>This level of privacy uncharacteristic for the regular Internet — or “Clearnet” as it is referred to by some dark web users — allows for a completely free exchange of ideas and information between the users. However, according to some researchers, it also leads to some highly illegal and immoral activities on the dark web marketplaces, such as the selling of illegal drugs, firearms and child pornography.</p>
<div>Owing to their anonymous, digital and permissionless nature, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are often the chosen means of exchange for transactions on the dark web.</div>

<preview>RenVM is driven by Darknodes, a decentralized network of computers. In exchange for compensation, they offer their computing power and storage space to everyone with certain conditions.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Darknodes?</h2>
<div>RenVM is a cross-blockchain liquidity network made up of thousands of darknodes, or autonomously managed nodes. </div>
<p>A darknode can be hosted by anybody, however certain conditions must be fulfilled such as: </p>
<p>These conditions create an incentive for node operators to resist malicious behavior by putting their deposits at risk. </p>
<div>Darknodes function as decentralized, trustless custodians for digital assets that users store on the RenVM platform. When the platform transforms a digital asset into an ERC-20 token, it enables users to collect fees. In peer-to-peer networks, nodes play a crucial role in establishing protocol security as well as facilitating network operations and the decentralized dark pool of the Republic Protocol is no exception in this case. </div>
<div>A darknode's primary function is to correlate orders from the Republic Protocol's scattered hidden orderbook which represents a more cooperative effort that is less computationally costly than Bitcoin mining. </div>
<div>When Darknodes find a match and confirm it in the orderbook, they employ order fragments to rebuild the private data of the orders after identifying the matched ones and validating them. The matched orders are sent to the relevant dark pool's settlement layer. At least one settlement layer must be defined by third-party dark pools. Similar orders are collected to be verified where Darknodes are subsequently rewarded for initiating the settlement. The reward goes to the first Darknode who acquires a sufficient quantity of matching order pieces and begins the settlement in a timely manner. </div>
<div>It's important to note that order shares are distributed evenly throughout the network. Transaction settlement costs are not paid solely in REN; instead, nodes are allowed to receive fees in other currencies such as ETH and various arbitrary tokens.</div>
<div>The REN token is often utilized as fuel to boost the sMPC network, which is powered by a Darknode (RenVM). Although the Darknode network is permissionless, in order to avoid the fabrication of a significant number of aliases, a bond of 100,000 REN tokens is mandatory to register and run. This prevents malevolent attackers from launching an unlimited number of Darknodes and flooding the network with errant ones.</div>
<div>According to the official documentation of RenVM, it is a big responsibility to run a Darknode for RenVM. It necessitates a reasonable level of participation in the network and community and introductory technical knowledge such as a familiarity with a command-line interface (CLI) is required. Users must update their Darknode and replenish it with ETH on a regular basis. Moreover, they should not participate in the RenVM ecosystem if they are not dedicated to contributing to the network's security, according to REN. ‌</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Data Privacy?</h2>
<div>Data privacy refers to the area of data protection and security that is responsible for the handling of sensitive data, including their notice, consent, and regulatory requirements. </div>
<p>Note that data handling includes three distinct categories: traditional data protection (backup and file restoration), data security, and data privacy.</p>
<div>Data privacy and protection imply that an individual or party is the sole actor in regards to the handling of their personal information and must be in total compliance with all applicable privacy laws. However, the current technological ecosystem depends heavily on data, which are now viewed as assets that are worth a lot of money for major firms. Internet companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook are making fortunes through data economics.</div>
<p>When making use of various media platforms, users have ultimately consented to be co-actors in their data’s collection, storage, management, and sharing. It is their job to ensure that their data is not being misused by reading the internet or media platform’s privacy policy before agreeing to it.</p>
<div>Data privacy, however, has not expanded to decentralized technologies. The blockchain framework ensures that all users within a network have total ownership over their data. Unfortunately, everyone has access to all user’s information regarding all transactions that transpire in a given network. As long as a user’s wallet address is not linked to his real-world identity, then his privacy is kept. </div>
<div>Unfortunately, most users have, in one way or another, utilized platforms that impose Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, which give away their real-world identities. There are various solutions for preserving privacy while conducting cryptocurrency transactions including privacy coins, mixers, and private wallets such as Blank.</div>

<title>Data Scraping</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/data-scraping</url>
<file>data-scraping.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Data scraping or web scraping is the process of extracting information from a website into a spreadsheet or a local file on your computer or database.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Data Scraping?</h2>
<div>In the world of computer science, data scraping, often known as web (online) scraping, is a way of extracting data from websites to save it on local databases or on other applications using computer software.</div>
<div>A typical application of data scraping is to collect content, pricing, or contact information from internet sources. </div>
<p>Two major components make up data scraping - the crawler and the scraper. </p>
<div>A web crawler, often known as a &quot;spider,&quot; is an artificial intelligence (AI) mechanism that uses hyperlinks and search engines to scan and search for data on the internet, much like a human will do in their free time. When relevant data is found, it is sent to the web scraper.</div>
<div>A web scraper is a specialized tool that extracts data from an online web page. The data beacons in the web scraper are used to identify the data that you wish to extract from the HTML file - generally, XPath, CSS selectors, regex, or a combination of these protocols are used in the process.</div>
<div>In market research, web scraping plays a major role as it is used to price, monitor, analyze, and collect product/service data that aids decision-making, content production, and marketing activities.</div>
<div>Scraping data is a useful technique for staying ahead in the business world. Consider a business that spends money on product marketing to increase sales, but is unaware that their competitors are many steps ahead of them by employing business automation technologies and a web scraper. The web scraper can quickly identify a competitor's new pricing as soon as it appears online, allowing them to respond quickly and maintain their dominance on the market intact.</div>
<div>Although online scraping can be done manually, automated methods are usually preferable for scraping web data since they are less expensive and work faster.</div>
<p>Web scraping, on the other hand, is not always an easy process. Since websites come in a variety of shapes and sizes, it is mandatory to check if your web scrapers’ functionality and capabilities align with the requirements of the sites.</p>
<div>Web scraping is mostly used in e-commerce and sales to track prices and generate leads. However, many investors are beginning to use this technology in online financial transactions these days. It automates the extraction of data from a variety of sources and saves the information in a structured manner for systematic review.</div>
<div>In the crypto world, for example, web scraping can be used to conduct a thorough market study and extract historical crypto market data. Experienced crypto traders can keep an eye on crypto prices and get a comprehensive view of the entire market cap with an automated data scraping tool.</div>
<div>While data scraping technologies have legitimate legal uses, they can also be used to collect and reinterpret data for unlawful purposes, including identifying pseudo-anonymous web service users or plagiarizing branded material. Spammers and fraudsters frequently utilize data scraping techniques to collect email addresses to send spam emails. It is also used to get into websites or corporate intranets and acquire information to conduct additional crimes, such as blackmail or fraud.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A term used for when ICOs will put up their tokens for sale.</preview>
<description>
<p>What Is Date of Launch?</p>
<div>An initial coin offering (ICO) is a type of funding campaign used when launching cryptocurrency coins or tokens. During an ICO, the development team behind a new cryptoasset announces that it will sell a certain amount of its asset to investors, which serves a dual purpose: to distribute the cryptocurrency among potential future users (who are interested in it enough to pay for participation) and to fund further development and marketing of the asset.</div>
<div>The date of launch is just one part of any ICO campaign: it is a point at which the sale of the asset to the general public begins. It is usually preceded by several months of intense preparation and, sometimes, one or more private sale rounds that distribute a smaller amount of the asset among a group of select investors.</div>
<p>Prior to starting the sale, the development team needs to design at least the basic technology behind their cryptoasset, ensure necessary legal compliance, develop a distribution plan and write and publish all the relevant documentation and much more.</p>
<p>This is why the date of launch is usually known to the public well in advance: to give the developers the opportunity to work with the community feedback and to provide time for a comprehensive marketing campaign to hype up the ICO.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Day trading is the practice of frequently buying and selling assets in order to make a profit on intraday changes in their price.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Day Trading?</h2>
<div>In stock, cryptocurrency and other markets the prices of assets tend to change continuously during the day under the effects of the market forces of supply and demand. Most of the time, especially in the less volatile environments, these fluctuations are too small to be a concern to long-term investors. However, there is a category of market participants who actively try to extract a profit from these movements called day traders.</div>
<p>The activities of a day trader involve trying to predict the short-term price actions of the assets they are trading in in order to make favorable buy or sell deals. This is a high-risk, high-reward activity due to an immense number of factors affecting intraday price fluctuations, some of which are hard or impossible to evaluate.</p>
<div>Day traders employ different tools and techniques to conduct the best trades that they can. Some try to analyze the price history of an asset in order to find price chart patterns that might repeat themselves in the future — a practice known as technical analysis. Others develop or purchase trading software that uses computing power to analyze current market data and conduct trades automatically. Others still trade based purely on instinct.</div>
<div>The cryptocurrency market, with its infamously high volatility, provides an exceptionally risky but potentially lucrative ground for day traders. When assets’ prices quite often change by 10% or more within a single day, both the profits and the losses can be significant.</div>

<title>Dead Cat Bounce</title>

<file>dead-cat-bounce.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A temporary recovery in prices after a prolonged decrease.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Dead Cat Bounce?</h2>
<div>A dead cat bounce is a price chart pattern in technical analysis. It occurs in assets that are in a long-term downtrend and represents a brief recovery, which is then followed by a return to the previous low and continued downward movement.</div>
<div>A dead cat bounce is more specifically a market pattern or behavior of a stock, cryptocurrency or any other asset that shows short-term recovery amidst a declining trend. It may be a short-lived upward movement of an asset after a major correction or downward movement. The term originated from the saying that “even a dead cat will bounce if dropped at a certain height.”</div>
<div>They may take place when a large enough number of bearish traders close their previously initiated short deals or when a similarly significant number of bullish investors believe that an asset has bottomed out and start opening long trades in it.</div>
<p>A dead cat bounce is a continuation pattern, i.e. after it takes place, the price continues moving in its prevailing long-term direction. The danger of this pattern is that it may at first appear as a reversal of the overall trend of an asset, leading bullish traders and investors to go long on it only for the price to continue falling afterward.</p>
<p>However, the peak of this phenomenon also presents an opportunity for traders to initiate short trades with the intention of taking profit when the asset resumes its fall.</p>
<p>While there are some methods of technical and fundamental analysis that allow trying to predict that the recovery is only temporary, it is a complex task with unreliable results. As such, they can only be definitively called after they have taken their course.</p>
<div>There are multiple variables that could point to the cause of a dead cat bounce, such as when bears start closing their short positions, or when bulls start opening new long positions believing that an asset has already bottomed. There are also instances when momentum traders start stacking positions as soon as they see an asset’s relative strength index at oversold levels.</div>
<p>Unfortunately, many novice traders, especially in the crypto space, fall prey to dead cat bounces as they believe that the assets they buy are on their way to recovery. This is exacerbated by the crypto industry’s lack of regulation, which helps facilitate shady activities like front-running and price manipulation.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important for analysts to observe the market further whenever an asset suddenly moves in an upward trend after a continuous decline since it doesn’t always indicate a bullish reversal, but could also be a dead cat bounce, which likely won’t recover to previous highs for a while.</p>
<p>It is always necessary to remember that these reversals aren’t actually reflective of the actual value of any financial asset but a reflection of the market’s collective psychology, which is chaotic and ever-changing. Precautionary measures should be observed before traders open new positions under any circumstances.</p>

<title>Death Cross</title>

<file>death-cross.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A death cross is a bearish technical trading indicator that occurs when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, indicating a big sell-off.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Death Cross in Crypto?</h2>
<div>A death cross is formed when a slower moving average crosses the faster moving average in the upward direction. The most popular moving average used by day traders is the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average. The slower-moving average has to cross the faster-moving average from below for a death cross to be formed on the trading charts. Other examples of death crosses can be seen in 5-day and 15-day averages, however, longer periods are more reliable and provide stronger signals of an asset/stock/cryptocurrency.</div>
<div>It is important to identify the key stages of a death cross to lock the perfect time of getting out of the market before the bearish trend begins. There are three main stages of a death cross:</div>
<div>Notice how the graph was moving in a horizontal direction when the yellow line (signifying the 50-day moving average) was above the purple line (the 200-day moving average). When the 200-day moving average crosses the 50-day moving average from below, a death cross is formed and the price falls from that point, and later, recovers slightly when a golden cross is formed.</div>
<h2>How Accurate Is the Death Cross?</h2>
<div>The death cross is usually formed when the price is falling, however, it is not a definitive indicator that the bull market has ended. There have been many instances when a death cross appeared, but the price only fell slightly, recovered, and then broke the previous all-time highs! This is also why financial analysts are divided when it comes to setting moving averages to identify a death cross. Some use the classic 200-day average and 50-day average, while others consider the crossover of the 100-day moving average over the 30-day moving average as a reliable indicator of a death cross and the start of a potential bearish trend.</div>
<div>Like every technical indicator, using the death cross alone is not a good strategy. Financial analysts advise using a variety of technical indicators to understand the price and volume activity from different angles before making a concrete decision to buy or sell an asset/stock/cryptocurrency. These technical indicators include, but are not limited to accumulation/distribution indicator, on-balance volume (OBV), relative strength index (RSI), moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and the stochastic oscillator.</div>

<file>decentralization-maximalism.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Decentralization maximalism refers to the belief that decentralization is the best approach and lifestyle to such a degree that any form of regulation does not need to exist.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Decentralization Maximalism?</h2>
<div>Traditionally, maximalism promotes the aesthetic of excess and “more is more” approach to life to flaunt one’s superiority, as opposed to minimalism, which favors keeping things simple and a “less is more” approach.
In the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain and crypto, maximalism tends to have negative connotations, taking a similar mentality to a higher level of extremes. Maximalists tend to believe their concept, construct and technology are superior to such a level that others are inferior and not required at all (one common example would be Bitcoin or Ethereum maximalists, who believe that the respective blockchains and cryptocurrencies are the only digital asset that will be needed in future, with others being redundant). </div>
<div>While decentralization refers to the removal of reliance on centralized bodies such as governing intermediaries and authorities, decentralization maximalism refers to the belief that decentralization is the best approach and lifestyle to such a degree that any form of regulation does not need to exist.</div>
<div>In addition to this, there tends to be an excessive focus on the benefits of decentralization, namely freedom, democracy, lack of censorship, a more robust and community-driven organization, and functionality that is not exposed to failure or corruption of governing entities. </div>
<p>While these are true to some extent, decentralization maximalism ignores the cons of decentralization, namely a clear separation of responsibilities, lack of unified vision, inefficiency, and in extreme circumstances, anarchy and chaos from the lack of regulation and governing authorities. </p>
<p>Ultimately, It is the embracing of an ideal that can only exist in theory, as the reality is that some form of governance and regulation is needed to provide some form of safety, security, or deterrence for the malicious behavior stemming from the anonymity that blockchain and DeFi provides.</p>

<preview>The Decentralization Ratio (DR) is the ratio of collateral value that is decentralized over the total stablecoin supply backed for those assets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Decentralization Ratio?</h2>
<div>The Decentralization Ratio (DR) is the ratio of collateral value that is decentralized over the total stablecoin supply backed for those assets. It is a function that measures the proportion of an asset’s value that comes from decentralized sources. It, therefore, helps to assess the riskiness of an asset. The DR takes into account every underlying component of collateral that a protocol has claims on, not just what is inside its system contracts. </div>
<div>The DR can be used to compute any stablecoin’s excessive off-chain risk. Collateral with excessive off-chain risk (e.g. fiatcoins, securities, and custodial assets, such as gold or oil) are counted as 0% decentralized. Off-chain risks may include government entities freezing or interfering with assets or forced KYC. An example of this could be the SEC prohibiting the transfer of USDC to non-KYC'd entities. It also includes risks attributable to the base currency underlying those assets, such as US Dollar inflation for USDC. In contrast, Ethereum and reward tokens like CVX and CRV would be considered 100% decentralized. </div>
<p>Take an instance of calculating the DR of the FRAX3CRV LP token. FRAX3CRV LP is made up of 50% FRAX and 50% 3CRV. Since FRAX cannot back itself, that half is not taken into account. The other half is 3CRV which is 33% USDC, 33% USDT, and 33% DAI. USDC, USDT and DAI are made up of 100%, 100%, and 60% fiatcoins respectively. So each $1 of FRAX3CRV LP token has around $0.066 ($1 x 0.5 x 0.33 x 0.4) or 6.6% worth of value coming from decentralized sources.</p>

<p>An example of such a system would be a business that relies on franchising to expand, in which willing individuals are allowed to purchase a franchise, open their own branch of the company and make independent managerial decisions in regards to hiring, workflow organization and so on.</p>
<div>Another prominent example of decentralized systems are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which are supported by networks of independent computer-nodes that achieve consensus via algorithms such as proof-of-work (PoW) to infallibly and uniformly process and record all transactions.</div>
<p>By the virtue of not relying on a central point of authority, decentralized organizations become more robust than their centralized counterparts; unlike in the latter, where a malfunction of the governing entity disables the entire organization, decentralized systems continue working even when one or several parts of them cease operation. They are also more democratic and less prone to censorship.</p>
<p>Decentralized organizations have disadvantages too, which mainly stem from a lack of unified vision and a clear separation of responsibilities. This tends to result in reduced efficiency compared to a single-minded centralized organization.</p>
<p>This problem is demonstrated by the fact that in 2020, Bitcoin’s network consumed over 70 terawatt-hours of electricity — comparable to the entire country of Chile —  despite it being able to process only about four to seven transactions per second.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Are Decentralized Applications (DApps)?</h2>
<p>DApps are any computer applications whose operation is maintained by a distributed network of computer-nodes, as opposed to a single server.</p>
<div>The concept of a decentralized application was enabled by blockchain platforms that support smart contracts, the first of which was Ethereum (ETH). In addition to being a regular cryptocurrency, Ethereum supports something called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can be described as a distributed computer whose state at any given moment is perfectly defined via a consensus algorithm.</div>
<div>EVM is Turing-complete, which means that it can execute every operation a regular computer is expected to be able to perform. It has its own programming language, Solidity, which allows developers to code and run any application they want on the EVM in a decentralized manner.</div>
<div>As a result of the way they are executed, DApps can provide the same quality of service that regular apps are capable of, while at the same time enjoying full advantages of decentralization, such as almost constant uptime and resistance to censorship and corruption.</div>
<div>There are many examples of successful DApps with millions of dollars in market capitalization and hundreds of active users, such as the Augur (REP) prediction market platform, the Golem (GNT) market for idle computer power and the Basic Attention Token (BAT) blockchain-based digital advertising platform.</div>
<div>Other examples of popular DApp platforms besides Ethereum include Neo (NEO) and NEM (XEM).</div>

<preview>A method for decentralized funding of projects that introduces a form of governance in the ICO process, allowing backers to vote for the return of their funds if certain conditions are met.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Decentralized Autonomous Initial Coin Offerings (DAICO)?</h2>
<div>Proposed in 2018 by Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum (ETH), it aims to combiner ideas from Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in order to increase the investors’ trust in the latter and put more control over the allocation of raised fund in their hands.</div>
<div>ICOs are a method of raising funds for the development and marketing of new cryptoassets that is indigenous to the cryptocurrency industry. When conducting an ICO, the developers who are seeking funding sell a part of the total supply of their cryptoasset to the general public. There is usually a soft cap — a funding target that needs to be achieved, otherwise, the campaign is traditionally considered a failed one and all the collected funds are returned to the contributors.</div>
<p>If the soft cap is reached, on the other hand, the developers gain full access to it, as well as to all the funds that were raised in excess of the target, as soon as the ICO period ends. This places all the power to decide over how the proceeds should be used in the hands of the centralized team behind the project, which can result in bad outcomes.</p>
<div>ICO teams are sometimes unable to finish their products in a reasonable amount of time, resulting in vaporware. Worse, some ICOs turn out to be outright scams that were not intended to go into a development phase at all. With little to no ability to enforce refunds due to a lack of defined regulations in the ICO space, investors’ only option in such cases is often to rely on the team’s ethics.</div>
<p>Buterin’s DAICO concept proposes to lock all the proceeds of an ICO into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) smart contract and put the governance over that DAO in the hands of the investors.</p>
<p>The funds would not be released all at once after the fundraising campaign is over, but rather be unlocked at a certain per-second rate called the tap variable, voted upon by the investors. Moreover, if the development team proves unable to finish the project, the contributors can vote to refund whatever resources remain to themselves.</p>
<p>DAICO is a relatively recent and yet unproven concept, but in theory, it is expected to make the governance of ICO funds more democratic and offer investors a degree of protection from fraud.</p>

<preview>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is founded upon and governed by a set of computer-defined rules and blockchain-based smart contracts.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO)?</h2>
<div>With the mass adoption of blockchain technology, a new form of company or organization has become increasingly popular. A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, is a company governed in a decentralized manner through blockchain-based smart contracts. The main idea behind DAOs is to give a large community of contributors the ability to participate in its governance and future development. </div>
<p>DAOs operate thanks to a combination of various smart contracts, which allow participants to take an equal part in the decision-making processes inside the organization. Decisions made by the community of stakeholders include how the company will use funding and resources. In order for the plans and rules of the organization to be accepted, a percentage of the community needs to be in a consensus. This consensus is achieved through a decentralized, distributed blockchain, and each DAO determines the percentage required for a decision to pass. </p>
<div>Initially, Bitcoin was perceived as the first project to get close to being a DAO. However, with the introduction of the Ethereum blockchain and its smart contract capabilities, DAOs have started evolving and getting closer to the ultimate goal of complete transparency and community governance. </div>
<p>The idea behind decentralized autonomous organizations is still undergoing heavy development, as this is a relatively new phenomenon in the business world. An important distinction that has to be pointed out is that DAOs cannot make products or develop code or hardware. However, DAOs can easily hire contractors to perform all these services once the community consensus has approved a hiring contract. </p>
<p>Decentralized autonomous organizations are designed to be completely transparent so that all financial operations performed by the company are visible to all shareholders and the DAO community. The smart contract and underlying code of the DAO are also publicly available. This high level of transparency is essential to the concept of a DAO. Just like the underlying motif behind cryptocurrencies, the idea of a DAO is to surpass the traditional centralized management of a company and create an absolutely transparent organization whose actions and finance are completely public. </p>
<div>Decentralized applications (DApps) play an important role in the activities surrounding a DAO. DApps are software products developed with the help of smart contracts, and DAOs are essentially a variety of decentralized apps. While some DApps are created to perform money management functions, DAOs are designed to serve as a decentralized platform for communal decision-making. </div>
<div>One important distinction that has to be made is that as open-source software, DAOs can be targeted by hackers and exploited. One famous case of such a bug exploit happened with the organization called “The DAO,” which was targeted by a group of hackers, and a big portion of its funds was siphoned to a copycat DAO.</div>

<h2>What Is a Decentralized Currency?</h2>
<div>Decentralized currency refers to bank-free methods of transferring wealth or ownership of any other commodity without needing a third party. The money we have traditionally used is centralized, controlled by a central authority. The third-party ownership has led to systemic issues as the currency value relies only on the centralized authority’s willingness to honor the obligation. Central banks, for example, can freely adjust the value to meet certain funding obligations which we’ve seen, through various financial crises, this is detrimental to people who lose control over the value of their own finances. </div>
<div>Decentralized currencies, or peer-to-peer currencies, are primarily used in virtual markets, with a value represented by encrypted code that is easily verifiable, but impossible to reproduce. The value of decentralized currencies is determined by the demand of the coin without a central authority having influence over it. It cannot be changed by any actor. </div>
<div>These currencies are also most often borderless; therefore, allowing for seamless and cheaper international payments, and are usually immune to inflation or deflation. The fast development of decentralized currencies is revolutionizing the way we transfer and quantify value and wealth. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Decentralized Database?</h2>
<p>Due to the rapid growth of blockchain products, there has been an increasing need for robust data storage solutions. While most DApps store data on blockchains like Ethereum, the costs are extremely high. As a result, most DApps are forced to migrate their data to centralized storage solutions. Unfortunately, despite the cost-effective nature of centralized storage solutions, they are vulnerable to hacks.</p>
<p>Accordingly, developers face the dilemma of choosing between sky-high prices and poor data security. Decentralized databases solve this dilemma, offering users the ability to store their intellectual property in a manner that’s censorship-resistant, fully secure, and always available.</p>
<p>In a decentralized database, the underlying blockchain technology provides 100% access to data in a distributed way. Each file is replicated across several storage nodes worldwide, lowering the storage costs and ensuring that the data is available even if one or more nodes are down. </p>
<p>Decentralized databases use clusters of blockchains customized primarily for database operations. The advanced data delivery network protects your intellectual property from data breaches, performance hiccups, and network failures. It is an ecosystem where you pay the lowest costs for storage space and read/write access while enjoying features like high scalability, censorship and tamper-proof, and unmatched security.</p>
<p>A decentralized database is the perfect blend of a decentralized framework and cutting-edge computing, enabling dApps to store and access their data seamlessly. Some of the notable features of decentralized databases include:</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A peer-to-peer exchange allowing users to trade cryptocurrency without the need for an intermediary.</preview>
<description>
<div>Traditionally, trading cryptocurrency requires the use of a centralized exchange. CEXs match the orders of someone who wants to buy crypto with someone who wants to sell, and vice versa. They can be thought of as similar to securities exchanges.</div>
<p>But there are several perceived disadvantages associated with traditional, centralized exchanges. </p>
<div>These platforms are owned privately. This means that there is a third party with its own motives and priorities — sitting in the middle of every transaction made. </div>
<p>As a result, these private companies have oversight of those transactions, and collect and hold details on all its customers. This is a direct challenge to one of the cornerstones of cryptocurrency: that there should be the opportunity for anonymity if desired by a user. </p>
<div>Just as importantly, transactions conducted on centralized exchanges are custodial — meaning the platform holds the asset that is being exchanged. </div>
<div>Decentralized exchanges tackle both of these issues, offering theoretically complete anonymity and, crucially, non-custodial transactions. This means the actual asset being exchanged never passes through the hands of an intermediary.</div>
<p>DEXs are seen by many as a vital part of the next wave of development in crypto. However, truly decentralized offerings (for example Radar Relay, which is built on the 0x protocol) are still very much in their infancy, and trading volumes on these platforms tend to be low. </p>
<p>Additionally, DEXs are likely to face further challenges from regulators, who have signaled that they do not agree with the view that decentralized exchanges should not be subject to the same oversight as centralized rivals because they do not actually hold assets.</p>

<title>Decentralized Governance</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-governance</url>
<file>decentralized-governance.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Decentralized governance refers to the procedures through which a platform's disintermediated, equitable management is carried out for blockchain networks and dApps.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Decentralized Governance?</h2>
<div>Decentralized governance entails a variety of voting techniques for platform technology, strategy, upgrades, and regulations. On-chain governance and off-chain governance are the two most common approaches to blockchain governance. </div>
<div>On-chain governance is built on blockchain-based systems, which usually employ automated cryptographic algorithms as a part of the network's computational design and consensus process. It also involves stakeholders who voting using native currencies to make changes to the blockchain directly.</div>
<div>On the other hand, off-chain governance refers to the decision-making process that takes place outside of the blockchain, such as on online forums or in person. Off-chain governance techniques include public debate, suggestions, and collectively agreed-upon updates.</div>
<div>In general terms, decentralization is a multidimensional term that involves the transfer of power and responsibility for public activities from the central government to subsidiary or quasi-independent government entities and/or the private sector. It is a type of organizational structure in which top management delegates responsibility to the middle and lower levels of management.</div>
<div>Decentralized networks and platforms depend on increasingly creative governance systems to secure the durability and overall real-world usage of their initiatives in the absence of a centralized authority. Traditionally, blockchain governance uses methods to make choices on project progression and ongoing upgrades and ensures that the fundamental protocols and ecosystem work smoothly and effectively. </div>
<div>From a global perspective, the widespread use of blockchain applications allows people to shift from the current centralized institutions and build a new social contract based on consensus rather than force, resulting in a more transparent, independent, and inventive global society. The new social contract would feature decentralized communication and cooperation platforms, as well as decentralized arbitration systems for resolving issues using smart contracts with rules agreed upon by the participants and consistent with a common law or natural law.</div>
<div>Roles vary depending on the structure of the network and the relationships within the decentralized network governance. This necessitates an allocation of governance responsibilities, rights, and obligations that is responsive to power dynamics among players. Furthermore, when new elements of power interactions, such as those involving server providers and miners, among others, become relevant in blockchain-based solutions, governance systems should be responsible for them. </div>
<div>Decentralized network governance sees power as resting in particular and dynamic connections, whereas traditional models of governance see power residing in positions. Depending on the interaction between various entities requiring governance, power might thus rest with anybody from individuals to companies to states.</div>
<div>A drawback of decentralized governance, however, is that a public blockchain is intrinsically volatile, and it may be forked or discarded by the community at any moment if it is no longer appealing or profitable. As a result, it is debatable whether a fully decentralized blockchain, such as Bitcoin, can be considered a universal ledger since there is no assurance that it will continue to operate or even exist in the future. Contracts and government services may become invalid due to obsolescence, disinterest, or a move to a different system.</div>

<title>Decentralized Identifier (DID)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-identifier-did</url>
<file>decentralized-identifier-did.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A decentralized identifier, or DID, refers to an ID that can be issued by an autonomous, independent, and decentralized platform that acts as a proof of ownership of digital identity.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Decentralized Identifier (DID)?</h2>
<p>Decentralized IDs are a new-age trust framework of universally unique identifiers (UUID) that are cryptographically verifiable and don’t need a centralized registration authority. They can be used to identify persons, abstract entities, organizations, data models and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.</p>
<p>The foundation of DID is to give back control of identity to internet users and empower them to generate unique identifiers using the systems they trust. By enabling authentication of these identifiers with cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures, both individuals and organizations can benefit from seamless, secure and private data exchange leveraging blockchain’s distributed ledger technology (DLT).</p>
<p>In today’s digital world, we need to provide critical information to access apps, websites, services and devices. The existing technology of universally unique identifiers (UUID) and uniform resource names (URN) requires a centralized registration authority and isn’t equipped to verify ownership of the identifier cryptographically. As a result, we’re often subject to privacy loss, data theft and other related problems. </p>
<p>But with the DID framework, users can store several accepted identifiers such as government-issued certificates, educational and tax certificates, and other personally identifiable information (PII) in a secured and private digital wallet. Rather than relying on a central authority to manage the user’s identity, a blockchain-based distributed ledger serves as the source of all identifiers stored in the wallet. The identification information is not stored on the ledger but in a user-managed wallet. It enables people to share different parts of their identity with various services as they see fit.</p>
<p>Unlike the centralized framework, users can present only the required information to any entity (website, app, etc.). These entities can verify that the proofs are true via a blockchain-based ledger. For instance, you’re trying to register for a new online service, and it needs you to prove that you’re over 18 years. Using the decentralized framework, you’ll be able to control what information is shared from your digital wallet with the online service. You can present proof that you’re over 18 without revealing your actual date of birth. </p>
<h2>The DID Framework</h2>
<div>The core DID draft, initially published by w3c, clarifies that a Decentralized Identifier is a simple text string. It consists of three parts:</div>
<div>DIDs are part of a global key-value database wherein compatible blockchains such as Ethereum host the DID Documents (e.g., public keys, service endpoints and authentication protocols). DIDs act as keys and DID Documents as values to describe specific data models to bootstrap cryptographically verifiable interactions with the identified entity in the decentralized ecosystem.</div>
<p>Most notably, a DID Document includes a public key for authentication. The owner of a DID Document may establish ownership by using the private key associated with it.</p>

<h2>What Is a Decentralized Marketplace?</h2>
<p>A decentralized marketplace, built on blockchain technology,  allows traders or investors to trade with each other while eliminating middlemen. They are available globally  and require no intermediaries to make trades possible. </p>
<p>No one has to know or trust anyone else as each trader has a copy of the exact same data and if the trade conditions are not fulfilled or data is altered or corrupted, the transaction cannot be executed. </p>
<p>Decentralized marketplaces also reduce points of weaknesses in systems where there may be reliance on specific actors which can result in reduced access to resources, outages, bottlenecks, or lack of incentive mechanisms to prevent corruption or inefficiencies. </p>
<div>While most commonly used for cryptocurrencies, investors can also use decentralized marketplaces to trade NFTs, houses, or even patented innovations or intellectual property. </div>
<div>Centralized marketplaces often have higher fees, lack transparency, and create rules that users may not wish to abide by. They also have greater security risks because the network relies on a single point which increases the chances of failure or hacking. On a decentralized marketplace, trades are executed by the traders only, with funds transferred, thanks to smart contracts. </div>
<p>They are more transparent because traders must all mutually agree on data and information that takes place in the exchange. Since there are no intermediaries, transaction costs are much cheaper. </p>
<p>If buyers and sellers agree to conditions, the transaction is executed automatically. Traders also don’t need to be located in the same place to make a trade. </p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A decentralized network is a collection of interconnected but distinct elements that interact with one another without the need for a centralized power or server.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Decentralized Network?</h2>
<div>A decentralized network is a combination of protocols spread across numerous computer devices, known as nodes. The capacity of nodes to communicate without the need for a monitoring body enables the element of decentralization. </div>
<div>In a distributed system, each computer has an up-to-date copy of the accessible data. Instead of depending on a single central server, a decentralized network spreads information-processing tasks among numerous devices.</div>
<div>Recent technology developments have enabled decentralized networks by providing PCs and other devices with considerable computing capacity that can be synchronized and used for distributed processing. </div>
<div>While decentralized networks are different from centralized networks in many ways, it is crucial to remember that they don't uniformly distribute data storage and processing across the network and still depend on primary servers - much more than one per network.</div>
<div>Another difference is that centralization depends on a single point of governance. The best example of decentralized systems is a Blockchain. </div>
<div>A blockchain is a distributed ledger system that allows nodes to store data and all transactions to pass through it. They must agree on the data's content for the network to function. Such networks have several advantages that include enhanced system stability, scalability, and privacy. Since individual users' workstations are not relying on a single central server to handle all activities, one of the most fundamental advantages of decentralized network administration is that there is no true single point of failure. They are also easier to establish since new computers (devices) can be added to increase computational power.</div>
<div>Decentralization may also aid in resource distribution optimization, ensuring that end-to-end services are delivered with increased effectiveness and reliability, as well as a lower risk of catastrophic failure.</div>
<div>Furthermore, because information does not flow via a single point but through a variety of distinct locations, a decentralized network design provides better privacy to end-users which makes tracking across a network much more complex.</div>
<div>Decentralized social networks are also becoming popular. Instead of a centralized server controlled by a company, these platforms function on servers that are run independently. Mastodon and the upcoming decentralized social network of Twitter named ‘Blue Sky’ are some popular examples.</div>
<div>A drawback of such networks is that they come with high maintenance costs due to their complex and dynamic architecture. It makes them exceedingly difficult to create and govern. Decentralized networks need multiple computers that must be upgraded and modified to match the newest functionality and security standards instead of a single core server or cluster of servers. In terms of energy consumption and responsiveness (latency), decentralized machines may be less effective. Data must occasionally travel over convoluted paths from one system to another, which means requests will take longer to resolve. </div>

<p>A decentralized payment network refers to a system where users, customers and vendors can exchange money without having to trust any third party to keep the network secure and operational. These networks are possible thanks to the globalization of internet access and are built using blockchains, which bring different degrees of decentralization, scalability and security.</p>
<p>A centralized payment network can be anything from a bank to a remittance company. Cash, as any physical centralized currency, still relies on central banks and governments to maintain its legitimacy and tackle threats like counterfeiting. This also means that governments can influence central bankers to modify their monetary policy. </p>
<p>These issues related to centralization are being solved by distributed ledger technology built on the blockchain. The main advantages of decentralized payment systems are that they are much cheaper, increase transparency, are more reliable and less prone to hacks and corruption than centralized networks. </p>
<p>Finally, decentralized payment networks have the ability to bring financial services to millions of people globally and empower people to have greater control over their financial future.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Decentralized Social Media?</h2>
<div>Decentralized social media, also known as blockchain-based social media, refers to social media platforms powered by distributed ledger technologies (DLT) like blockchain or DAG. As such, activities on these platforms are irrevocably recorded on a decentralized protocol where no central authority can control or oversee, unlike centralized networks like Facebook, Twitter, etc. </div>
<div>Conventional social platforms not only control users’ posts but also what they see, since these networks tend to prioritize revenue generation. Therefore, they present users with attention-grabbing advertising content, making them more entertained than well-informed.</div>
<p>On the other hand, users on decentralized social media networks have the freedom to interact however they wish without censorship as the developers usually only provide guiding rules, leaving the rest to a distributed group of users. </p>
<p>Decentralized social media platforms prevent the unauthorized sale of user data which is one of the contentious issues with centralized social networks. Moreover, blockchain technology increases user privacy and data security using cryptography methods.</p>
<div>Despite their promises, decentralized social media also have some shortcomings. For example, lack of moderators may result in users posting inaccurate information or offensive content with no way to delete. Furthermore, there’s the risk of a 51% attack in which a malicious actor could theoretically control over 50% of a network’s power, allowing them to edit data as they please, which would damage the integrity of the system.</div>
<div>Examples of decentralized social media networks include Subsocial (built on Polkadot and Kusama’s Substrate framework), Uptrennd and Steem. Despite their massive potential, blockchain-based social networks have a long way to go before becoming mainstream and being on equal footing with their centralized counterparts.</div>

<h2>What Is a Decentralized Stablecoin?</h2>
<div>A stablecoin is a digital asset built on the blockchain that is designed to maintain a price peg at a designated price, most often $1. This effectively removes holders from the swings of the market whilst providing a secure and stable way.</div>
<div>Stablecoins act as a mid-point between holding assets and withdrawing to the fiat system or are used as a more effective way of executing cross-border payments. Centralized stablecoins are usually fiat collateralized off-chain, usually directly connected to third-party custodians like a bank. Tether (USDT) and Coinbase’s USD Coin (USDC) are examples of centralized stablecoins. These stablecoins require you to trust that the third party has the corresponding dollars they issued. </div>
<div>Decentralized stablecoins are fully transparent, non-custodial with no or partial third-party control. All collateral-backing is visible to all as funds are on a publicly verified blockchain. This enables the stablecoin to be more trustless and secure with a single entity controlling the funds. They can be divided into two parts: crypto-collateralized and algorithmic. </div>
<div>Collateralized stablecoins can increase or decrease the supply manually, by minting or burning when required. Algorithmic stablecoins utilize smart contracts, or algorithmic markets operations controllers (AMOs), to automatically control the supply. </div>

<preview>The process of transforming encrypted data back into a format that is readable by a user or machine.</preview>
<description>
<p>Encryption is used to protect sensitive data from bad actors, and to ensure that it is difficult to view or understand in the event that it is stolen. There are many reasons why a party might wish to encrypt data, such as for transmitting credit card details or user passwords.</p>
<div>Cryptography is at the heart of many parts of the internet and of wider digital communication. It is most commonly concerned with disguising readable information (known as plaintext) as unreadable ciphertext through the process of encryption. </div>
<div>A range of systems are available to accomplish this — using cryptographic algorithms — where plaintext is fed in order to create encrypted data, and fed back in order to be decrypted.</div>
<div>In the cryptocurrency sector, the most commonly used form of cryptography is known as public key or asymmetric key encryption. In this system, pairs of keys are used to encrypt and decrypt information. On the Bitcoin blockchain, encryption and decryption is carried out through the Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).</div>
<p>Cryptographers are preoccupied with the strength of their cryptographic systems. Algorithms are designed to be practicably impossible for a real adversary to crack. </p>
<p>There are some algorithms that are referred to as information-theoretically secure, meaning they can be proven to be unbreakable even with theoretically unlimited computing power. However, in reality these systems are extremely difficult (often more or less impossible) to actually implement. </p>
<p>As a result, most cryptographic systems currently used are known as computationally secure.</p>
<p>Although it is theoretically possible to break them, it would not be practical for an actual bad actor to do so.</p>

<preview>The &quot;deep web&quot; is the part of the internet that is hidden from regular search engines.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Deep Web?</h2>
<div>There are several names for the &quot;deep web.&quot; Some refer to it as the &quot;dark web&quot;; others, the &quot;invisible web,&quot; but all refer to the parts of the internet not accessible via generic browsers like Google, Bing and Firefox. Instead, those curious enough must download a deep web browser like Tor. The concept of the deep web rose to mainstream prominence with the Silk Road trial back in 2015, where Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to a double life sentence plus forty years. The Silk Road was an online deep web marketplace that introduced many internet users to Bitcoin, as Bitcoin was the main currency used on the site. </div>
<p>Despite the FBI’s crackdown on the Silk Road, the deep web continues to be a popular destination for those seeking what they cannot find within the confines of the traditional internet. Traditionally the deep web is associated with the purchase and sale of drugs, illicit goods and other black market commodities.</p>

<title>DeFi</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi</url>
<file>defi.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A movement encouraging alternatives to traditional, centralized forms of financial services.</preview>
<description>
<div>Traditionally, almost all financial transactions involve an intermediary of some sort. When a customer makes a payment with a credit card, there are several parties involved, including acquirers and banks. At multiple stages, third parties have complete oversight of the details of the transaction — and the ability to stop or decline it.</div>
<p>The DeFi movement is based on the idea that the financial system should not be controlled by monopolistic third-party providers of this sort, and that it should instead be decentralized. Some have political or philosophical reasons to hold this premise, while others simply believe that it will increase the efficiency and speed of the financial world.</p>
<div>There is a large and growing range of players in the world of DeFi. Most major applications are built on Ethereum, which allows for the development of decentralized software. They make use of smart contract technology to minimize or completely remove the need for human or corporate gatekeepers.</div>
<div>DeFi providers are building alternatives to traditional financial services, as well as entirely new products. Existing DeFi applications include stablecoins, decentralized exchanges, and peer-to-peer lending services. DeFi is also the basis for the growing world of prediction markets.</div>
<p>Many commentators believe that DeFi heralds the future of financial services, and large bets are being made on DeFi start-ups. However, there have been several high-profile failures amongst DeFi players, and the field remains very much in its infancy.</p>
<p>DeFi should not be confused with embedded finance (sometimes known as invisible finance,) which is a movement within traditional financial services and fintech that aims to broaden access to banking and payments technology.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A DeFi aggregator brings together trades across various DeFi platforms into one place.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a DeFi Aggregator?</h2>
<p>A DeFi aggregator brings together trades across various decentralized finance platforms (DeFi) into one location, saving users time and increasing efficiency for cryptocurrency trades. As the name suggests, DeFi is spread out across different blockchains such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Within each blockchain is an ecosystem of isolated financial protocols. </p>
<div>While having a wide selection of different protocols is beneficial to diversify investments and getting the best yield rates from crypto lending, efficiency and convenience are hindered since the financial information is spread vastly across multiple protocols. That’s where DeFi aggregators thrive. </div>
<div>DeFi aggregators siphon the very best prices from DEXs, lending services and liquidity pools into one place so that users can optimize their trades. Without an aggregator, users need to go to each platform on an individual basis to compare prices that will generate the best deal for them. Then, the user must manually execute each transaction using smart contracts. While this strategy may be fine for casual crypto trading, it severely limits those looking to implement advanced trading strategies. </div>
<p>Not only do aggregators pull the best prices, but some DeFi aggregators even offer a unique, user-friendly way to analyze and combine other users' trading strategies via a convenient drag and drop mechanism. This way, users can create an entirely new strategy of their own using the inspiration of other successful traders. The drag and drop mechanism also helps users visualize complex DeFi protocols via blocks that can be built on top of one another.</p>
<p>Aggregators put UX/UI at the forefront, offering a far superior experience to the traditional way of manually interacting with liquidity layers. As a result, this helps users who are not as crypto-savvy as trading experts navigate the world of DeFi with ease. </p>
<p>The potential downside of using a DeFi aggregator is the gas fees. As Ethereum continues to reach new all-time highs and volume increases across the network, gas fees tend to follow this upward trend. Usually, gas fees are higher on aggregators compared to using the individual protocol. However, some aggregators found a solution to this problem via gas tokens or gas cubes developed into the platforms that let users save money on gas fees. It’s also important to note that while gas fees may be higher on an aggregator, they act as a sort of “convenience fee” since the optimization and efficiency that comes with an aggregator can outweigh the gas fee.  </p>
<div>While DeFi has certainly helped bring millions of new users to the cryptocurrency market, there are still users who are intimidated by the sheer number of protocols to choose from and industry-specific lingo. As a result, many crypto enthusiasts prefer to simply hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) in a wallet without putting it to better use. With the advent of DeFi aggregators, new entries to the industry can benefit from DeFi without having to understand the technical complexities of trading, coding, blockchain, etc. An aggregator gives power to these new users and helps them make better trading decisions.</div>
<p>In a decentralized economy such as this, it’s still important to centralize some aspects of DeFi for the sake of efficiency. DeFi aggregators bring together the best of both worlds of centralized organization strategies and decentralized finance protocols to create an important tool in this new, exciting industry. </p>

<preview>DeFi degenerates. A subculture associated with a disreputable corner of decentralized finance known for pump and dump schemes.</preview>
<description>
<div>DeFi is home to many of the most important new projects in the world of financial services, and is seen by many as the next frontier for cryptocurrency and for finance generally.</div>
<div>But there is another aspect of DeFi — one that is concerned with unruly, unregulated crypto projects that tread a fine line between joke and scam. These projects are the natural home for the subculture known as DeFi degens.</div>
<p>Degens congregate in private Telegram and Discord channels, where they share information about new DeFi projects through which they think they can generate profits… or simply have fun. </p>
<p>For many degens, decentralized finance is an opportunity to develop projects that amount to crossovers between monetary projects and massive multiplayer online games. These take the form of abstruse and unpredictable tokens such as the ill-fated Yam, which has become the totem for DeFi degens.</p>
<p>These projects are unaudited, unregulated, and based on cryptic rules that are often impossible to understand for all but those who developed the code. </p>
<p>Yam, for example, involved new token dumps every 12 hours, prior to which users would frantically build up the value of the token before taking out their profits. Participants who do not understand the ways in which these DeFi projects operate are likely to be burned, but degens see them as fun and profitable pastimes that are also an opportunity to test the limits of crypto code and the boundaries of acceptability within the crypto community.</p>
<div>DeFi degens are closely associated with the pump and dump trend, in which junk coins are hyped up through private forums and channels only to be abandoned or forced into collapse — but not before degens have taken their profits.</div>

<title>Deflation</title>

<file>deflation.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A decline in the general level of prices for goods and services in an economy.</preview>
<description>
<p>In macroeconomic terms, deflation usually accompanies a contraction in monetary supply. However, prices can decline for a wide range of reasons — including low levels of productivity in the economy, advances in technology, or simply lower levels of demand.</p>
<div>In the context of Bitcoin, deflation tends to refer to the cryptocurrency's maximum supply. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins mined — and at this point, no new coins will be created, and no more block rewards will be given. </div>
<div>In fact, the circulating supply of BTC will reduce over time as private keys are lost and coins become unrecoverable. Many other cryptocurrencies are also deflationary in nature.</div>
<div>Deflationary currency systems are very unusual in economic history — in fact, cryptocurrencies probably represent the first example of such an approach. Economists are interested in deflationary systems for exactly this reason, and some believe that crypto's deflationary nature will completely revolutionize our approach to money. Others, however, are skeptical, believing that a deflationary currency system will inevitably result in hoarding and liquidity problems.</div>
<div>The Bitcoin community has always been preoccupied with the impact of a deflationary system. For those who wish for the currency to become a widespread means of exchange (as opposed to pure speculation), concerns about deflation are tied up with conversations on subdivisions of Bitcoin (such as into bits.) Proponents believe that Bitcoin's theoretical infinite divisibility will help to solve potential problems associated with deflation.</div>
<div>Furthermore, some believe that the problem is in fact not with the deflationary nature of crypto, but with the inflationary nature of fiat currencies. These people tend to suggest that prices will naturally fall in the Bitcoin economy through increases in innovation and productivity, but that a deflationary spiral would not occur because Bitcoin is not based on theoretical loans but on a real and finite monetary supply.</div>

<file>delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>An alternative to the Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work consensus algorithms.</preview>
<description>
<div>Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms have been developed over recent years in response to the perceived problems and limitations associated with Proof-of-Work (PoW) — in particular, the resource-intensive nature of crypto mining at scale.</div>
<div>In a PoS mechanism, there is no mining at all. Instead, the validation of new blocks on the blockchain happens based on the number of coins being staked. Users lock a certain number of coins as a stake — and at given moments, users with stakes are randomly assigned validation rights for the next new block. </div>
<div>The larger the number of coins a user stakes, the higher their chances of getting validation rights in each round. In addition to reducing the computational costs of running the blockchain, PoS systems make a nefarious attack much more difficult as it would require the attacker to have at least 51% of the total coins on the chain.</div>
<p>In a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system, participants still stake coins. However, rather than becoming responsible for validation themselves, stakeholders outsource that work to a delegate — groups of which are then responsible for reaching consensus between themselves.</p>
<p>DPoS delegates are elected based on their reputation and perceived trustworthiness, and the theory amongst DPoS proponents is that the system incentivizes good behavior amongst delegates as the community has the right to vote them out and replace them at any time.</p>
<div>DPoS blockchains are generally faster than blockchains run on PoW and PoS systems, with a higher per-second transaction rate. However, DPoS is in its infancy, and it is not generally considered secure enough to be the basis of money-transacting blockchains.</div>

<title>Delisting</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/delisting</url>
<file>delisting.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The process of removing an asset/stock/cryptocurrency from a trading exchange is called delisting.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Delisting?</h2>
<div>When a project no longer meets the exchange's listing standards, it may get delisted. The reasons behind delisting can be many, some of them are:</div>
<div>An asset can no longer be purchased or sold on an exchange after it has been delisted. A delisting is typically permanent, but a project's asset might get relisted in exceptional circumstances.</div>
<div>If a business is purchased or becomes private, it may be delisted voluntarily. When a firm fails to satisfy the listing standards set out by exchanges where its assets are traded, it is delisted involuntarily. </div>
<div>Listing prerequisites can be complicated, and various sorts of issuers and securities may have specific regulations. Overall, they encompass prompt filing of financial statements, a share price above a certain price, a reasonable level of shareholders, a minimal threshold of market capitalization, or specific revenue, profit, cash flow, and trading activity prerequisites.</div>
<div>Delisting can have serious implications since company shares that aren't listed on popular exchanges are harder for investors to explore and buy. This implies the firm will be unable to offer new shares to the market to fund its new business ventures.</div>
<div>An impending bankruptcy, inability to complete obligatory reports, or share values underneath the exchange's minimum threshold are all possible causes for delisting a stock. The business can request to get its shares re-listed after it solves the issue and fulfills the listing criteria. Investors often have conflicting feelings about relisting a firm, and it may only have limited success during its second term on the market.</div>
<div>Although not all businesses are delisted for bad reasons, it protects markets from being flooded with substandard securities from issuers who may be nearing the end of their life cycle. Exchanges assist to decrease the systemic risk associated with the market and safeguard investors by ensuring that all issuers adhere to rigorous administrative requirements.</div>
<div>In the world of crypto, when a token/coin is delisted, all of its trading pairs are removed from the cryptocurrency exchange. However, investors who have already invested in the delisted project are given a specific time frame to withdraw their funds, after which the crypto project is no longer available in any form on that cryptocurrency exchange. </div>
<div>A recent example of delisting was witnessed on July 7, 2021, in which the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange delisted OST, RCN &amp; WPR projects after conducting a thorough review. According to Binance, any project that is removed from its platform violates one or more rules. These rules include a lack of commitment to the project, less trading volume, low network security, evidence of fraudulent activity, and several other parameters that influence the delisting decision of the Binance team.</div>
<p>In summary, every trading platform has a certain set of rules, and it is advised to follow those guidelines to avoid getting delisted.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A denial-of-service attack aims to temporarily make a computer or network service unavailable to its intended users.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack?</h2>
<p>A denial-of-service attack restricts access to a computer or network in order to prevent intended users from using it. DoS attacks have become one of the go-to tools hackers employ in order to disturb the normal operation of computer-based services. One of the most effective approaches to completing such an attack is through a distributed approach. </p>
<p>Denial-of-service attacks can vary in their type and organization. Volumetric attacks depend on consuming the full bandwidth capacity of a network by flooding it with echo requests. Syn flooding attacks are similar, as they too consist of flooding the network with an overwhelming amount of requests; however, the attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing it. Fragmentation attacks seek to disrupt the inbuilt reassembling ability of the target network. Application layer attacks target undetected programming errors in an application or network by once again overwhelming the target with requests. Lastly, phlashing DoS attacks aim to permanently damage the target network by sending out false update requests and inserting malware throughout the network. </p>
<div>Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are the most common type of malware attack. In order for a DDoS attack to work, hackers introduce malware to networks of connected devices and start bombarding them with a huge amount of requests, with the intention of overwhelming the network.</div>
<div>Unfortunately, cryptocurrency exchanges have become increasingly targeted by DDoS attacks because of their growing popularity. Since 2020, there have been numerous DDoS attack attempts on some of the major crypto exchanges. Unfortunately, this renders the exchange’s services unavailable for a prolonged period of time. </div>
<div>With the rise of applications of blockchain technology, a new type of DoS attack emerged — a blockchain denial-of-service (BDoS) attack. These attacks focus on blockchains operating under the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism like Bitcoin. </div>
<div>The way this new subtype of DoS works is by attacking the rewards mechanism for miners. The PoW consensus mechanism relies on miners to validate new blocks, and if miners do not receive their rewards, block validation is interrupted. It is important to note that it is significantly harder to perform a successful DoS attack on a decentralized network. While usually, DoS attacks rely on the centralized nature of traditional networks, this approach does not work with blockchain-based networks. In order to interrupt the mining process, attackers send fake proofs to the blockchain that they have a mining advantage. This discourages other miners from performing operations necessary for transaction validation, which essentially slows down the processing power of the blockchain significantly. Even so, BDoS attacks have been extremely rare and unsuccessful so far. </div>

<preview>A financial instrument deriving its value from the value of an underlying asset.</preview>
<description>
<p>Derivatives are extremely common and popular financial instruments. They are often used for risk hedging. If an investor knows that they want to buy an asset, they may sign a derivatives contract agreeing to buy the asset at a specific price. This helps them to hedge against potential fluctuations in the value of the asset.</p>
<div>However, derivatives markets are also very popular as a subject of speculation. Instead of ever owning the asset in question, traders simply bet on its future value. The explosion of derivatives, particularly those based on mortgage lending, was the key driver behind the financial crisis.</div>
<div>But derivatives still have uses, and they are becoming increasingly common in crypto. </div>
<div>Crypto derivatives can, of course, be used as a means for speculators to make profit, just like derivatives based on fiat currencies. But the risk hedging aspect is possibly the most important long-term advantage of the arrival of crypto derivatives. </div>
<div>A key example of this was the mass launch of Bitcoin futures in 2017. Many in the crypto community believe that in order to achieve mass adoption as a store of value, Bitcoin needs to offer investors a way of mitigating risk. </div>
<p>Wild price fluctuations are a chance for speculators to make money, but they are also offputting to more risk-averse investors. The launch of Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange was seen as a big milestone for Bitcoin as it offered institutional investors a way to hedge against those fluctuations.</p>
<p>Crypto derivatives are widely available on most major crypto exchanges. There are also moves towards the expansion of derivatives offerings from traditional global exchanges such as the Nasdaq.</p>

<description>
<div>Derivatives are financial instruments with a value that is derived from an underlying asset such as a cryptocurrency, fiat currency, or commodity. Traders in derivatives can bet on the future price of the underlying asset, either as a means of speculation or as a way of hedging risk.</div>
<div>In a derivatives market, there are generally two types of derivatives contract on offer. Options give people the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed price, but do not obligate them to do so. Futures mean that the transaction must go ahead on the date of expiry.</div>
<p>There are two further common derivative types, known as forwards and swaps, but these are unregulated and therefore not traded on regulated exchanges. Forwards are non-standardized and unregulated futures, while swaps are a contract to exchange financial obligations.</p>
<div>Many of the leading crypto exchanges are also derivatives markets. Indeed, the growth of derivatives is considered by some to be a key requirement for the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. The 2017 launch of Bitcoin futures by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) was an important example of this, with institutional investors now able to trade crypto derivatives — crucially, without having to hold the actual asset.</div>
<p>However, derivatives markets carry serious risks and these can be systemic — as seen during the financial crisis, which was precipitated by the collapse of derivatives. </p>
<div>In crypto, derivatives markets have been the subject of repeated regulatory crackdowns. The U.K.’s Financial Services Authority announced in October 2020 that the sale of crypto derivatives to retail investors would be banned in the country — citing the volatility of the underlying assets and the risk of cybercrime in crypto.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Desktop Wallet?</h2>
<div>A desktop wallet is a type of software wallet that is usually non-custodial. This means no central platform or third party has custody of cryptocurrencies belonging to a particular wallet. Only the end-user has the ability to move funds using private keys.</div>
<div>Desktop wallets deliver accessibility, which is important to many crypto users, particularly those new to crypto trading. Desktop wallets also provide ease of use since they are often connected to trading platforms, giving users a convenient method of checking their crypto while remaining in control of their private keys. Some desktop wallets like AtomicDEX use atomic swaps to facilitate peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading, while others have integrations with centralized exchanges. Desktop wallets are free to download, and many either use partial or fully open-source code. </div>
<p>One drawback to using crypto wallets on desktop devices is the lack of portability compared to mobile devices. However, most desktop wallets are interoperable with a corresponding mobile wallet. This means users can quickly and efficiently migrate their seeds from a desktop device to a mobile device for greater portability if needed.</p>
<div>A few popular desktop wallets include AtomicDEX, Electrum, Exodus, and Guarda.</div>

<preview>A type of cryptocurrency wallet in which keys and addresses are created from a single seed.</preview>
<description>
<div>In the past, Bitcoin wallets operated by generating Bitcoin addresses and private keys at random, whenever they were needed by the user.</div>
<p>This had several significant drawbacks, the most important being that — if the details of the wallet were lost — all of the keys and addresses would be lost along with it.</p>
<div>A deterministic wallet is built on a specific algorithm and seed. All of the keys and addresses created by a deterministic wallet are built from that seed. The practical result of this is that, as long as the user still has access to the seed, a new wallet can be created and all of the addresses and keys recovered — even in the event that the original wallet becomes corrupted or lost.</div>
<p>There are several other advantages to deterministic wallets. The first of these is the master public key feature. This key can be generated from a specific wallet's master private key, and can be used to produce all of the addresses created by the wallet — but crucially, none of the private keys. </p>
<p>This means that a third-party user with the public key can view the balance of a wallet, but cannot transact with it. Further, deterministic wallets are hierarchical. This means that every private key generated by the seed can itself be used as a master private key which can be used as its own deterministic wallet and, therefore, used to create further keys.</p>
<p>Most major cryptocurrency wallets are now deterministic wallets. In particular, the extremely popular Electrum system is deterministic (however, unlike other options such as the BIP32, it is not hierarchical.)</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a DEX Aggregator?</h2>
<div>Cryptocurrency exchanges are classified into two main types — centralized and decentralized. DEX aggregators serve as a unified explorer for prices and liquidity offered by decentralized exchanges (DEXs). With the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies and the growing utilization of decentralized exchanges, DEX aggregators have become a sought-after service. </div>
<p>Decentralized exchanges offer varying pricing, and it is not always easy to find the best deal for the trading pair you are looking into. Not only that, crypto investors are starting to turn more and more to DEXs, as they offer increased security and a better fit with the innate characteristics of a cryptocurrency. However, with the rising interest in crypto, more and more DEXs flood the market, and investors often struggle to find the best possible liquidity and pricing. This is where DEX aggregators come into play. While investors can try and sift through different exchanges with limited success, DEX aggregators rely on complicated algorithms to take into account numerous factors in selecting the best possible provider for a given token swap.</p>
<p>The easiest way to visualize what a DEX aggregator does is to compare it to a search engine. Imagine services like Google Flights, where you get aggregated information from numerous airlines, and you can pick and choose which deal serves you the best. DEX aggregators function in a very similar way. They accumulate data from a wide array of decentralized exchanges and facilitate split trades in order to offer the best possible prices. Not only that, DEX aggregators complete numerous calculations and give users the option to perform split trades in order to achieve the best possible price of a swap. In essence, crypto traders cannot accomplish this result because DEX aggregators perform extremely complicated calculations in a matter of seconds. </p>
<div>Interestingly, the first DEX aggregator was created as a part of a hackathon competition in 2019. Participants in the competition felt that they needed the aggregated information from numerous DEXs, but this was not available as a service yet. So Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov created the 1inch MVP over the span of 18 hours during the hackathon. Of course, the initial version of the aggregator was not completely functional and polished; however, this was a perfect example of why DEX aggregators were a necessary service.</div>
<div>Since 2019, DEX aggregators have been rising in popularity. Simultaneously, the interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) has been increasing. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology completely revolutionized both personal and enterprise finance, and DEX aggregators allow investors to make informed decisions about their trades and coin swaps.</div>

<preview>An open-source stack for building debt markets on Ethereum.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Dharma Protocol?</h2>
<div>Dharma Protocol is a permissionless lending platform that allows users to generate debt agreements without the need for an intermediary.</div>
<p>Debt markets have historically been one of the most important financial platforms in the world. From mortgages to corporate bonds, they are the backbone of any financial system.</p>
<p>But today, most debt markets are dominated by established financial institutions with high fees and inefficient systems. That's where Dharma Protocol comes in: it is a decentralized blockchain-based protocol that allows anyone to easily create their own digital lending products by tokenizing debt.</p>
<p>A debt market is simply a place where borrowers and lenders come together to lend money at some agreed-upon interest rate. A mortgage is an example of a lending product: when you take out a mortgage from your bank, both you and your bank agree to certain terms of repayment, including how much you pay back each month, how long your loan term will be, and what interest rate you'll pay for borrowing the money.</p>
<div>The protocol enables a variety of different types of debt products, including order-book style exchangeable bonds, margin lending products, over-collateralized loans, and interest-bearing stablecoins.</div>
<p>The Dharma protocol is structured in such a way so as to facilitate maximum composability between different classes of financial products and across other protocols in the decentralized finance ecosystem.</p>
<div>While there are many iterations of DeFi being explored in the crypto space today, we believe that the most important class of financial instruments are those that aim to move the capital from savers to borrowers.</div>
<p>In order to facilitate this movement of capital, there needs to be a robust set of primitives that can be combined together to build more complex financial instruments. This is precisely what the Dharma protocol aims to provide.</p>
<div>Dharma leverages the security and immutability of the blockchain to create trustless lending and borrowing, without requiring a centralized intermediary. By building all of its functionality into a single API, it dramatically simplifies the process of issuing credit for both individuals and businesses.</div>
<p>Although Dharma is built for credit applications, it can also be used for any type of agreement that requires a balance between rigidity and flexibility. Its flexible modules are designed to ensure that anyone – from a first-time developer to a Fortune 500 company – can issue tokenized debt in minutes.</p>
<div>Currently, there are many blockchain projects focused on decentralized exchanges. However, only a few are trying to solve the problem of decentralized borrowing or lending. Because lending is fundamental to commerce and financial markets, it is one of the first use cases that Dharma has chosen to tackle.</div>

<title>Diamond Hands</title>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Diamond Hands is a popular term on social media platforms. It refers to people who hold their coins even if their portfolio drops in value by more than 20%.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Diamond Hands?</h2>
<div>Popularised by r/wallstreetbets, and later spreading to other social media platforms, the term, diamond hands, is a way of expressing that someone is or will continue HODL-ing an asset, even if the value of their portfolio suddenly falls by 20% or more. Although “diamond hands” is sometimes used to describe a person who is holding stock, it is more commonly used as a self-description for someone who holds cryptocurrencies. People who say, “I have diamond hands” (a.k.a. strong hands) deeply believe that cryptocurrencies will drive the future direction of global finance and that mass adoption is inevitable, if not imminent. </div>
<div>This group of cryptocurrency bulls doesn’t sell, even when a storm of seemingly never-ending FUD hits the market. Those who have diamond hands might even tell their followers, friends, family, or anyone who is willing to listen to Buy The (F*******) Dip. Sometimes, diamond hands buy the dip, but the dip keeps dipping. In other words, prices of cryptocurrencies may go down significantly, but there are people who are still unwilling to sell because they have faith that their favorite cryptocurrency project(s) will one day eventually reach the moon status. Basically, if you have diamond hands, you are a very optimistic person even when it seems like the sky is falling. </div>
<div>On social media platforms, like Reddit and Twitter, diamond hands is often use in its emoji form: 💎🙌. Diamond hands are risk-takers who have a long-term perspective on the market. Often, many people who identify with this group will share adaptations of the Wolf of Wall Street - “I'm not leaving!” GIF to express their steadfast sentiment. Although diamond hands is widely considered to be an admirable group, they are sometimes warned by other investors to ‘take profits’ in fiat or stablecoins when the market surges. Those with diamond hands, however, rarely (if ever) take profits since they firmly believe the market - even if it crashes - will recover and only grow stronger over time.</div>
<div>When the market goes down, many people in the diamond hands group will undoubtedly express themselves on social media with some iteration of “diamond hands.” Crypto investors who decide to sell at low prices after a massive market crash might get teased for having weak hands, paper hands, or spaghetti hands. In other words, this group is the polar opposite of diamond hands.</div>

<file>difficulty.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A measure of how hard it is to validate a new block on a blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<div>In proof-of-Work based blockchains (such as Bitcoin), new blocks are added to the chain through mining, which involves solving cryptographic puzzles. </div>
<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is designed to have a new block added roughly every 10 minutes. However, as the Bitcoin white paper predicted, the speed with which the cryptographic puzzles will be solved will fall over time due to advances in the hardware being used. </p>
<div>This can be seen in the shift in mining technology from conventional desktop or laptop computers, to GPUs, and now to dedicated ASICs that are run in huge, highly regulated farm environments.</div>
<p>To offset the increases in hardware speed, the cryptographic puzzles are made more difficult. This difficulty is constantly revised, with the intention of targeting a specific number of blocks mined per hour.</p>
<div>The increase in difficulty on the Bitcoin blockchain is staggering. When BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block, they probably did so on a regular desktop computer. At this point, the difficulty was measured as 1. As of writing, the Bitcoin difficulty is now somewhere around 20 trillion.</div>
<div>Successful Bitcoin miners are rewarded with new coins. However, Bitcoin is designed with a hard upper limit on the number of blocks mined. When this level is reached, no new coins will be created — but mining power (or hash power) will still be required for the continuing operation of the network. In order to encourage this, the rewards for mining will change; instead of being awarded coins, successful miners will receive a share of the fees associated with transacting on the network.</div>

<preview>Digital technologies are these electronic tools that have the ability to generate, store or even process data.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Does Digital Mean?</h2>
<p>Digital can be described as electronic technology which can generate, store as well as process data in two states, positive as well as non-positive. The positive is expressed or represented through the number 1 and the non-positive is expressed or represented through the number 0. This data is then transmitted or stored with digital technology and is expressed as a string of 1's or 0's.</p>
<p>Digital technologies are these electronic tools as well as systems, devices and resources that have the ability to generate, store or even process data. Some of the most well-known examples of this include social media, online games and cryptocurrency exchanges. </p>
<p>The word digital itself comes from two words, digit, and digits, which is the Latin word for finger, as fingers are often used for the process of counting.</p>
<p>In other words, you can define something that is digital as something that records or stores information as a series of the number 1 and 0, in order to show that it is present or absent. It is also something that is in the form of binary digits. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies, and as an example here we will use Bitcoin, are digital-only currencies. This means that they exist as 1s and 0s, and there are no physical BTC in the real world: all of them are stored in the digital ledger known as the blockchain, and they only exist on the blockchain. When you are transferring any cryptocurrency, you are transferring the data of 1s and 0s from one crypto address or wallet to another. </p>
<p>A cryptocurrency by itself is a form of digital asset that is based in a network that is distributed across a large number of computers, which makes them fully decentralized.</p>

<h2>What Is Digital Art?</h2>
<p>In simple terms, digital art can be defined as anything crafted or viewed with digital means. Digital art has been around since the 1960s.</p>
<div>With the advent of computers and multimedia technology, artists began incorporating new forms of media into their craft to make digital installations, video art, graphic imagery, digital photography and so forth. However, recently the concept of non-fungible tokens has even further elevated what digital art can be by assigning more concrete intellectual property rights via cryptographic keys. NFTs, which typically use the Ethereum blockchain network, have made digital art far more valuable and desirable than ever before. Cryptocurrency users have developed entire digital art marketplaces to auction off pieces of art, media and other digital memorabilia.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Digital Asset?</h2>
<p>A digital asset, in the world of crypto and fintech, refers to the digital representation of something of value. Typically, this value is tokenized, and the resulting tokens can represent either full ownership or fractional ownership that is verified and recorded on a distributed ledger. A digital asset can include cryptocurrencies or crypto tokens, or can represent a real-world asset that is stored on the blockchain in the form of a token that represents its value, identified with its unique ID. </p>
<p>This can come in the form of a commodity, a file, record of a land registry, an accounting ledger, a 3D printing raw file, and much more. Asset values can be defined by monetary amount, kilograms, ounces or litres or a digital asset like the digital rights to a film, a non-fungible token (NFT), loyalty and reward points, or a file which can be quantified on the blockchain by the number of usage or views granted to the holder for example. </p>
<p>Digital assets can be used as either a medium of an exchange that can be used to acquire goods or services, or can simply refer to the physical representation of a real-world asset in its digital asset form with its unique identification code. </p>
<p>As blockchain and cryptocurrency assets continue to mature, the use cases for digital assets will grow, opening up the world to new opportunities for wealth creation.</p>

<description>
<p>An asset custodian is a person or entity that has the responsibility to look after assets of value on behalf of an investor or client. In this case the custodian is responsible for looking after digital assets like BTC and ETH. </p>
<p>Unlike traditional assets, custody of digital assets requires sophisticated security and internal control processes to ensure that the clients’ assets are stored safely and securely. Unlike traditional assets, digital assets have an added set of risks. For example, if a person loses their private key, then they will be unable to access those assets. This poses a very high key man risk in the long term. </p>
<p>As a result, institutions often appoint a third party custodian to manage and store their digital assets. Digital asset custodians usually require a license from a regulator within their jurisdiction to ensure safety measures and security are up to standard.</p>

<h2>What Is a Digital Asset Ecosystem?</h2>
<div>A digital asset ecosystem is a place that incorporates everything that exists within the crypto space. It includes the a wide range of cryptocurrency tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, products and services, and futures. </div>
<div>Since Bitcoin first entered the market in 2009, the digital currency space continues to grow. So much so, that the digital asset ecosystem is expanding into other markets as well. A few sectors experiencing growth include art (in the form of NFTs), finance with the inclusion of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), insurance, real estate, gaming, healthcare, and gambling.</div>
<div>The digital asset ecosystem is, essentially, a basket of different classes secured by an underlying technology, known as blockchain. These include cryptocurrencies, NFTs, stablecoins, CBDCs, and asset-backed and security-backed tokens.</div>
<div>With the aid of a digital asset ecosystem, traditional assets will become digitally available and accessible to investors, thus reducing the costs associated with them. With this system involving different protocols, professional investors have the opportunity to gain exposure to different areas of crypto, such as yield farming and blockchain gaming.</div>
<p>As can be seen, the digital asset ecosystem is an umbrella term, with many subdivisions branching off of it.</p>

<title>Digital Barter Economy</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/digital-barter-economy</url>
<file>digital-barter-economy.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Eliminating the inherent weaknesses of the traditional barter economy, a digital barter economy makes it easier to trade both physical and virtual items anywhere in the world.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Digital Barter Economy?</h2>
<div>A barter economy is the direct exchange of goods and services against each other, for example, paying for a taxi ride with two packets of cigarettes. This model works as a medium of exchange, like fiat currency, and is one of the oldest, most natural forms of economy in human history. While this works perfectly in a local environment with physical proximity, these sorts of economies do not work on a larger scale, thanks to the obvious issues of distance and lack of standard units of measure. </div>
<div>Digital barter takes the fundamentals of a traditional physical barter economy and brings it into the 21st century with blockchain technology, providing solutions to these physical and standard unit barriers that stand in the way of bartering at scale.</div>
<div>Blockchain allows you to digitize physical goods and services with tokens, and thus solves the problem of physical proximity. Using the original example, you can essentially pay your taxi ride token with cigarette tokens from anywhere in the world. Both tokens are digital, and both are placeholders for the real asset and can be used to redeem the goods or services. As well as digitizing physical goods, blockchain also further bolsters digital barter by offering ways to trade tokens you have for the tokens you want, for example, trading taxi ride tokens for cigarette tokens through decentralized marketplaces. </div>
<div>Another innovation is that digital barter economies can include goods that aren’t physical, such as a patent or intellectual property, or items that are physical but too large to be used as a means of payment in their physical shape. Once digital assets are created on blockchain they can essentially be fragmented digitally, something that in the physical world would be impossible because it would mean the destruction and devaluation of the underlying physical asset. </div>
<p>Because of this flexibility, in a digital barter economy, it is therefore theoretically possible to pay for that taxi ride with something like, if accepted as payment, a revenue share token, or a tokenized fragment of a famous painting.</p>

<preview>A commodity that exists digitally, as opposed to in “meatspace.”</preview>
<description>
<p>There is a huge range of things that might be termed a digital commodity. These include things like computing power and storage. Increasingly, however, the term digital commodity is primarily taken to mean digital currencies.</p>
<div>In practical terms, digital commodities regulation is targeted squarely at cryptocurrencies. In the U.S., lawmakers signed the Digital Commodity Exchange Act 2020 to regulate the activities of trading platforms. Other laws and regulations governing the use of cryptocurrencies and associated activities have appeared rapidly in recent years, from New York state's BitLicense through to the United Kingdom banning the sale of crypto derivatives to retail investors.</div>
<div>Because cryptocurrencies are commodities, they can also be used as the basis for derivatives — a popular financial instrument whose value is based on the value of an underlying asset. For example, a trader might choose to enter into a derivatives contract that gives them the right to buy or sell an amount of cryptocurrency at a certain date or value. The growth in derivatives is seen by many as crucial for the mass adoption of digital assets.</div>
<p>Confusingly, digital commodity trading can also refer to selling real-world assets such as oil and gas electronically.</p>
<p>Here, digital commodity trading relates to the digitization of different elements of the commodity trading chain. </p>
<p>For example, technology can be used to automate the securitization of assets; for massive data mining intended to help traders make better investment decisions; for optimizing models to help traders take better option positions; and, at the end of the chain, for the automation of back-office processes such as settlement and documentation.</p>

<preview>A currency that exists only in digital form, as opposed to traditional physical currencies.</preview>
<description>
<div>Digital currencies (theoretically) perform all the functions of fiat money, in that users can pay for goods or services with them. </div>
<div>However, they present a number of potential advantages. These can include faster transaction speeds, lower transaction costs, greater transparency, and the potential for decentralization.</div>
<div>Digital currencies have a history almost as long as the internet. The prototype for digital currencies, DigiCash, was developed in the late 1980s. However, they tended to suffer from an intractable problem known as double spend — and it was impossible to ensure that each unit of a currency could only be spent once during each transaction.</div>
<div>Bitcoin was the first digital currency to solve the problem of double spend, using blockchain technology to create an immutable record of each transaction. It became the first digital currency to operate as a medium of exchange, an accounting unit, and a store of value.</div>
<p>Today, digital currencies are one of the most important developments in finance. The number of cryptocurrencies in the market has exploded, and new protocols are being introduced to solve problems such as the lack of scalability associated with Bitcoin.</p>
<div>One of the most high-profile, and controversial, digital currency projects has been Facebook’s Diem stablecoin — formerly known as Libra. It faced intense scrutiny from regulators, and a concerted pushback at the central bank level has forced Facebook to scale back its plans.</div>
<div>However, central banks are convinced by blockchain technology, and they are also developing their own digital currencies (CBDCs). Unlike most cryptocurrencies, CBDCs would be based on a centralized ledger operated by the central bank in question. This would allow the central bank to exercise control over monetary supply in the same way it does in the conventional economy.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Digital Dollar?</h2>
<div>A digital dollar is a form of currency that is only available in electronic form and the financial systems of many countries rely on the electronic form of US dollars which are held in various bank deposits in electronic or digital form. As the name hints, the digital dollar never takes physical form and is always stored on a computer network. All its trading activities are also done on the internet.</div>
<div>Back in May 2021, the Digital Dollar Project was announced, according to which five U.S. central bank digital currency pilots will be launched in the near future, in an effort to promote the US dollar as a form of digital currency around the world. </div>
<div>The concept of digital dollars has emerged after the eruption of cryptocurrencies in the world. With Bitcoin (BTC) emerging as the first and now the largest cryptocurrency in the world, authorities all around the globe are now considering launching their very own digital currencies with countries like China, the USA, and many others in the race of developing a stable currency that is considered as legal tender in the world.</div>
<div>The main distinction between the digital dollar and the various cryptocurrencies available in the market today is that the latter are decentralized assets with a different value than traditional currencies. Digital dollars, like all digital currencies, are managed by the Federal Reserve and are backed by the government, which means that they function like physical money and are worth the same.</div>
<div>The digital dollar is an intangible asset and is valued at acquisition cost. The world is shifting toward digitization as everything has gone digital.</div>
<div>Instead of using physical dollar bills, people can make purchases by transferring digital currency to retailers using their electronic devices. The transfer of digital dollars will work like popular payment apps, including Google Pay, Venmo, and PayPal.</div>
<div>Following the successful launch of decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which store value but aren’t limited to any authority, the world governments are investigating the possibility of developing their own digital currencies, also known as central bank digital currencies (CBDC).</div>
<div>Many countries are moving towards digital currencies, such as the Bahamas' Sand Dollar project, which is currently in production, in addition to China's digital yuan, a pilot project launched back in 2014.</div>
<p>Some advantages of the digital dollar include:</p>
<div>The digital dollar will compete with cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins (USDT, USDC, etc.), which are crypto-assets pegged to the US dollar to stabilize their value. The launch of the digital dollar is crucial because the current banking system is facing an existential threat due to the digital currency age started by cryptocurrencies. </div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Information used by a person or entity to identify themselves to a computer or network.</preview>
<description>
<p>There are several types of digital identity already in widespread use. The most obvious of these is government identification, which is used for purposes including access to banking, corporate registration, and, of course, for surveillance purposes. </p>
<p>Identification systems also exist for customers to transact online, log in to digital services, and to prove their identity to organisations such as employers.</p>
<p>Traditional identity systems tend to suffer from a number of common problems. They can be inaccessible (often by design,) insecure and at high risk of attack, very easy to defraud, and extremely fragmented.</p>
<div>Blockchain technology can be used to solve many of these problems. There are deep experiments currently being conducted into the use of blockchain for digital identity applications, and some of these are already in operation at scale — for example, a number of national governments are moving their entire identity schemes on to blockchains.</div>
<p>Blockchain-based digital identities are seen as particularly useful for the 11 billion people around the world with no proof of identity — often because of cost, complexity or inaccessibility. A lack of proof of identity locks these people out of crucial facilities such as banking. However, the explosion in use of mobile phones provides a route for the development of simpler, free blockchain-based identity solutions.</p>
<p>Crucially, blockchain technology is also vastly more secure than the digital identity technologies generally being used today. While it is currently extremely easy to forge an identity online, blockchain-based identity solutions allow for absolute confidence in the validity of an identity because of the immutable nature of blockchain-based recordkeeping.</p>

<file>digital-signature.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A method for proving the authenticity of a digital communication.</preview>
<description>
<div>Digital signatures employ cryptography to provide a way of determining whether a digital message or document is real. </div>
<p>If a signature is deemed valid, it can be assumed that the communication is from the person it says it's from (known as authentication,) that the sender cannot reasonably deny that the communication is from them (non-repudiation,) and that the communication has not been changed or tampered with (integrity.)</p>
<div>Digital signatures use public key cryptography, in which encryption and decryption is carried out using pairs of public and private keys. As the name suggests, public keys are broadcast publicly, while private keys are kept secret.</div>
<p>To sign a message with a digital signature, the sender uses software to create a hash of the message, which is then encrypted using their private key. To verify a message, the encrypted hash is decrypted using the sender's public key. Then, a second hash of the message is created; if this hash matches the decrypted one, the message is valid.</p>
<div>Digital signatures are not the same as electronic signatures, although the former term is often used to describe the latter technology. </div>
<p>Electronic signature simply refers to any digital mark that is intended to represent a signature. Common examples of this include HelloSign and Adobe Sign. However, some electronic signature tools may include digital signature technology — meaning an element of public key cryptography may have been used.</p>
<p>Digital signatures are widely used online, for example to authenticate network connections. They are also becoming increasingly common in government. For example, key documents are now published by the U.S. Government Printing Office with accompanying public signatures to verify their authenticity.</p>

<div>DSA was developed by the US government during the 1990s. It is a signature algorithm, not an encryption algorithm, and uses public-key cryptography to generate digital signatures.</div>
<p>DSA has three steps:</p>
<p>The first step is to generate a key pair.</p>
<p>The second step is to sign a message.</p>
<p>The third step is to verify the signature of the message.</p>
<div>A DSA key pair consists of a private key and a public key. The private key is generated randomly and kept secret, while the public key can be shared with anyone. In order to sign a message, the private key must be known by the party generating the signature, while in order to verify a message signed with a DSA signature, one only needs the public key corresponding to the private key used to generate the signature.</div>
<p>A digital signature is a mathematical scheme that demonstrates the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature indicates the message was created by a known sender (authentication), and that the message was not altered during its transmission (integrity). Digital signatures are central to modern computer security and commerce.</p>
<p>The DSA algorithm can be used to generate the digital signature of messages. It is normally used in conjunction with other security protocols such as PGP or SSL/TLS. It is also used with some cryptographic nonce schemes and key exchange protocols.</p>
<p>It uses mathematical functions and a set of keys to secure communications over the internet. The private key is used to sign messages and the public key is used to verify that those signatures are authentic. The use of two different keys helps ensure the authenticity of digital signatures.</p>
<p>The DSA algorithm is based on the ElGamal signature scheme, which was developed in 1985, but it has many differences in terms of how it functions and how it secures data. The DSA algorithm requires a random number generator for generating keys and signing data, whereas ElGamal does not. The DSA algorithm also specifies that a message shouldn’t be signed more than once or with different keys, which ElGamal does not specify.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)</h2>
<p>The digital signature is a process in which the author of the message can verify that the message is not altered after it is signed. The signature also protects the user against forgery.</p>
<p>It uses asymmetric key cryptography. Hence, there won’t be any need for any additional asymmetric key cryptography. This makes DSA faster than other algorithms like RSA.</p>
<p>It requires less memory space than other algorithms because it uses only a 160-bit hash value to generate the signature.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A dip is when markets experience a short or protracted downturn.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Dip?</h2>
<div>Dip means to put or let something down quickly or briefly into liquid in the traditional sense. However, in the world of cryptocurrencies, a dip is the process of buying an asset after it has declined in value. Buying a dip implies that you have an opportunity to invest in a coin or token that has experienced a short, or potentially long-term decline in its value.</div>
<p>Many cryptocurrency investors only became familiar with the crypto market after the downturn of the cryptocurrency market all the way back in 2018. In fact, it was throughout this year that plenty of investors managed to learn how risky and speculative the crypto market can actually be. But buying a coin or a token in a downtrend does not actually mean that its price is guaranteed to increase over time, as there are risks involved with just about anything you do in terms of investing. </p>
<p>You need to have strong emotional intelligence and understand the nature of the market you are engaging in.</p>
<div>You have a phrase in regards to dips and investing: &quot;buy the dip.&quot; This refers to going long on an asset or security after the price has experienced a short-term decline in repeated ways. Through buying this dip, you can profit through its long-term uptrends, however, it is unprofitable or tougher during secular downtrends. </div>
<p>Dip buying even has the capability of lowering your average cost of owning a position; however, the risk, as well as the rewards of dip-buying, needs to be evaluated on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that buying the dip does not in fact mean that you are guaranteed any profits. An asset can drop for a multitude of reasons, and these include changes to its underlying value. Just because the price is cheaper than it ever was throughout its history does not imply that the asset represents good value.</p>

<file>directed-acyclic-graph-dag.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A way of structuring data, often used for data modelling, and increasingly as a consensus tool in cryptocurrencies.</preview>
<description>
<div>Directed acyclic graphs consist of vertices and edges. There are no blocks, unlike in a blockchain. Instead, transactions are recorded as vertices, and these are recorded on top of one another. Transactions are submitted to the DAG by nodes, much like on a blockchain. In order to submit a transaction, a node must complete a Proof-of-Work task.</div>
<div>In a DAG, every new transaction must reference previous transactions in order to be accepted onto the network, in a similar manner to the way in which blocks on a blockchain contain references to previous blocks. When a transaction is referenced by another transaction, it is confirmed. In order for that transaction to be confirmed, it must be referenced by a further transaction, and so on.</div>
<div>The tip on which a new transaction will be built is determined by an algorithm. Tips with more confirmations are more likely to be selected for building.</div>
<div>DAGs have a number of perceived advantages. Transaction speeds are high as processing is not limited by block creation. There are no transaction fees because there are no miners — and, of course, the lack of mining has huge environmental benefits.</div>
<div>However, there are significant drawbacks too. Perhaps the most important is that they are not fully decentralized, unlike blockchains. In addition, the use of DAGs in cryptocurrency settings is very much in its infancy. These two factors combine to mean that, for the most part, DAGs are now used primarily as a way to get a network started, rather than as a system on which to build a stable and lasting network.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Discord is a web-based communication tool or application primarily built to enable communication between gamers.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Discord?</h2>
<p>In the world of gaming, Discord probably isn’t an unheard thing. </p>
<p>At its core, Discord is a communication application where users can send text messages, participate in voice and video calls, and participate in communities (servers).</p>
<p>When launched in 2015, its main focus was only on serving the gaming community by enabling convenient communication through a proper channel to cater to the community-building needs of gamers. In fact, its founders have been involved with the video gaming industry for a long time and released Discord to provide a better communication medium to gamers.</p>
<p>However, the dynamics have changed. Discord is not a communication platform only for gamers anymore. It has evolved into a medium for all kinds of users looking to build a community or communicate with others. </p>
<p>Anyone can create a community, called a server on Discord, and invite others to join and connect with them. Inside a server, different channels can be created for specific topics.</p>
<h2>The Recent Rise in Discord’s Popularity</h2>
<p>By the end of 2020, Discord already had over 140 million active users. One reason is the increasing demand for social networking and communication tools during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the rise in content creation contributed the most to its popularity in the recent past. </p>
<p>Discord has always been popular in the gaming community, which is one of the reasons that the application experienced a surge in downloads during the pandemic. As people had more free time, they indulged in e-gaming and many started streaming their games online. </p>
<p>Recently, Discord has been a hotbed for crypto enthusiasts. It has become quite trendy in the world of crypto and blockchain as many groups have formed communities using its servers. </p>
<p>Discord lets online streamers take calls from guests while doing online streaming. Gamers can connect via the application and play multiplayer games. It also offers tons of other integrations that enable you to use multiple features, such as listening to songs on Spotify with friends. Besides, you can automate a few tasks by setting bots.</p>
<h2>A Word About Its Safety</h2>
<p>Discord isn’t the most secure platform out there as it doesn’t have end-to-end encryption. The data you post goes through their servers that can get into the hands of third parties. </p>
<p>You can access Discord directly from the website and use it within your browser. However, it’s available in the form of applications for Windows, Android, macOS, iOS, and Linux as well.</p>

<title>Distributed Consensus</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/distributed-consensus</url>
<file>distributed-consensus.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Collective agreement reached among nodes in a network.</preview>
<description>
<div>Distributed consensus is necessary for the functioning of a network or machine in a decentralized manner. </div>
<div>Consensus is easy to agree between, say, two parties (Alice invites Bob to her house; Bob agrees.) But as the number of parties (or nodes on a network) increases, consensus becomes more difficult to achieve.</div>
<p>In order to coordinate in their common goal, all the nodes on a network need to agree on a &quot;single source of truth&quot; — that is, they need to be confident that the information they are getting is accurate, even in the event that multiple other nodes on the network fail. </p>
<div>Every node in the network (or every participant in, for example, the Bitcoin blockchain) needs to have an identical copy of the ledger, and there must be agreement that the version of the ledger held by every node is accurate. In order to achieve this, blockchain projects use distributed consensus algorithms.</div>
<div>In the Bitcoin blockchain, consensus and coordination is achieved through Proof-of-Work, as proposed and developed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Other consensus mechanisms exist, including Proof-of-Stake and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. </div>
<div>However, most distributed consensus mechanisms have the same basic properties. First, they are based around a stake — some store of value that a proposer is putting up, such as currency or computing power. They also involve a reward for validation (that is, for mining a new block,) which is generally taken in the form of a coin native to the blockchain in question. They also work on the basis of transparency — that is, other users need to be able to see if a validator or proposer is attempting to cheat or defraud the system.</div>
<div>Proof-of-Work is the foundation for blockchain-based consensus, and remains the basis of the Bitcoin blockchain, on which new blocks are mined. However, there are new consensus mechanisms being used on other blockchain projects. Some of these, such as Proof-of-Stake, are now achieving greater adoption.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>An attempt by a bad actor to disrupt the operation of an application, server or network by flooding it with traffic.</preview>
<description>
<div>DDoS attacks are among the most common forms of cyberattack. They often make use of networks (botnets) of devices (bots) that have been compromised by malware — placing them under the control of the bad actor. </div>
<p>The attacker instructs every bot to send huge numbers of requests to the target, with the intention of overwhelming the network. At this point, normal service is denied to legitimate traffic... hence the name.</p>
<div>Crypto exchanges have become common targets for DDoS attacks. This isn't surprising, as bad actors tend to focus on high-profile businesses, and rising awareness of cryptocurrencies has put exchanges firmly in the spotlight.</div>
<p>Early in 2020, two major crypto exchanges were taken offline by DDoS attacks in the space of 24 hours. For exchanges, the risks are obvious: successful DDoS attacks mean that users cannot transact until they are brought back online.</p>
<p>The high number of successful DDoS attacks on crypto exchanges and other crypto sites is indicative of a more significant problem. In order to achieve mass adoption, cryptocurrencies need to be trustworthy. Consumers need to know that they will be able to access their funds and transact with the same ease and reassurance that they feel when using a bank. If exchanges and similar sites have fallen victim to DDoS attacks, consumers may reasonably be concerned about the stability of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A database that is shared by multiple participants, in multiple places. The basis for blockchains.</preview>
<description>
<div>Distributed ledgers are replicated and synchronized amongst participants in a decentralized network. The ledger is used to record interactions (transactions) between participants — including, for example, a payment.</div>
<div>This technology is a contrast to the centralized systems that are used by most businesses and financial institutions. In a business situation, ledgers are often complex, unwieldy, expensive, and very easy to tamper with. Furthermore, it is very easy for different versions of a ledger to become out of sync, resulting in stakeholders acting on incorrect or partial information.</div>
<div>Decentralized ledgers are not under the control of any single party. Instead, every participant (or node) has their own exact copy of the ledger, which is usually updated every few seconds. Participants agree on changes to the ledger through consensus. All participants are equal, and there is no central intermediary through which transactions must be routed.</div>
<div>In addition, distributed ledger technology allows for extremely high levels of security. The use of cryptographic hashes and digital signature technology mean that participants can be assured that transactions recorded in the ledger are genuine, and that they originate from legitimate senders as opposed to bad actors.</div>
<div>Distributed ledger technology is most widely known as the basis for Bitcoin. However, DLT and blockchains have wide ranges of potential uses both in public settings (such as cryptocurrencies) and in private environments such as businesses. The technology and the protocols underpinning it are designed to allow participants to transact without the need to trust any other party — for example, participants in the Bitcoin blockchain do not need to trust that a central bank or clearing institution is going to act as expected or as they say they will.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A network in which the data and applications are dependent on multiple sources, as opposed to one location.</preview>
<description>
<p>In a distributed network, data, computing tasks, and applications are spread across several (often many) machines, which communicate with and depend on each other. Distributed networks are established with the intention of spreading out work and sharing resources.</p>
<div>Distributed networking is very useful in removing or reducing bottlenecks associated with computing tasks. They are a highly efficient way of sharing resources — indeed, in most cases it will be more efficient to expand a network than to increase the hardware capabilities on individual nodes on a network of a smaller size. Additionally, distributed networking provides much higher levels of fault tolerance, and these levels increase with the size of the network.</div>
<p>There are several forms of distributed network, based on different types of computing. For example, client/server distributed networking is the basis of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP,) on which the web is built.</p>
<div>A distributed network might also be said to be decentralized. In these situations, every node (computer) on the network can be used for any task requested by any other node — leveraging unused computing power from idle machines. Decentralized distributed networking is the basis for blockchain technology.</div>
<div>Decentralized distributed networking allows for the operation of blockchains, which rely on the distribution of data and the mutualization of computing power. This form of networking also provides major benefits for those seeking anonymity, which is an important cornerstone of cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. </div>
<div>These networks are seen by many as the next frontier for the web, forming the basis of projects such as the DApp ecosystem on Ethereum, and many other crucial parts of the emerging Web3 landscape. However, networks of this sort are also becoming more popular among large businesses and other organizations that wish to establish their own solutions for cloud computing or data sharing.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Diversification?</h2>
<p>Diversification is a risk-management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio.</p>
<p>Portfolio holdings themselves can be diversified across asset classes and within classes, as well as geographically, through investing in foreign markets as well as domestic markets. Keep in mind that diversification limits portfolio risk but can also mitigate the performance in the short term.</p>
<p>In other words, rather than concentrating money into a single company, industry or asset class, investors can diversify the investments across a wide range of different companies, industries and asset classes. </p>
<p>When the funds are divided across large and small companies, both at home and abroad, in both stocks as well as bonds, you can avoid the risk of having all of your assets in a single location.</p>
<p>This can be seen in the cryptocurrency world as a way of investing in more than one cryptocurrency. In other words, if you only invest your money into BTC, and Bitcoin's value drops, you lose money; however, if you have investments in BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, ADA, DOT, and so on, and BTC's value drops, but the other currencies go up in value, your losses are balanced out or you gain profits as a result by not putting all of your potential gains in a single basket.</p>
<p>Diversification is used in order to minimize investment risk. Since the future is uncertain, especially in the highly volatile world of cryptocurrency, the value is always changing and as such, we need to diversify the investments among different currencies in order to not get exposed to certain risks.</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of diversifying your investments is the fact that you can learn about different coins as well as projects, and as such, achieve better performance in the long run.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Documentation is a part of token economies that stores all the details of an asset on the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Documentation?</h2>
<div>Documentation is one of the four essential components of token economies – which refers to the economics of goods and services that have been tokenized. Blockchain enables these economies to function without intermediaries while documenting and proving ownership, (documentation), digitizing physical assets (tokenizing), executing specific rules (governance), and enabling potential trade (trading). </div>
<div>Documentation allows you to record all the details of an asset (which can be anything) and anchor its proof of authenticity on the blockchain. The timestamp, signature, author, and fingerprint (hash) become proof of who documented what and when. </div>
<div>Blockchain is excellent for creating forge-proof records. Documentation is the cornerstone of Bitcoin transactions and can secure various other financial transactions. It also works for that cases where records and data need to be forge-proof and revision-proof. Documents on a blockchain are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered. </div>
<p>Once something has been documented on the blockchain, you can create a unique fingerprint (called a hash) of this data. This allows you to prove at any time that you have the original, unaltered file by just verifying it again. As long as the file has not been modified, the hash will always be the same.</p>
<div>Documentation also involves a timestamp – this ensures that you can track the exact moment when a block has been validated by a blockchain network. Because the entire network is in sync across nodes around the world, the timestamp ensures that the input of data can be validated and recorded.</div>
<p>Outside of a blockchain environment, proving the unalterable time of origin of an agreement, statement, or document signed is nearly impossible. Pictures can easily be photoshopped and signatures can be altered. </p>
<div>Documentation on the blockchain removes these uncertainties by proving the integrity of the data and recording the timestamp on-chain. Documentation also helps to prove the author of the record via the cryptographic signature.</div>

<description>
<div>Cryptocurrency investors are sometimes classified according to the relative size of their holdings.

At the other end of the scale, those with especially large crypto holdings are known as whales.</div>
<p>Crypto dolphins sit between these two classifications: they are no longer counted among the very smallest crypto players, but they have also not yet amassed a large enough holding to be counted amongst the biggest.</p>
<div>In contrast to dolphins or minnows, crypto whales often have their movements monitored closely by the crypto community. Stories abound about crypto whales moving large sums of money, especially across the Bitcoin blockchain. These stories are often used to illustrate one of the primary advantages of Bitcoin: extremely low transaction fees. Crypto whales are sometimes reported to have moved hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of Bitcoin for just a few dollars in fees.</div>

<description>
<div>The Bitcoin Dominance Index is provided by CoinMarketCap, and keeps track of Bitcoin's total market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all digital assets.</div>
<div>This metric is intended to demonstrate the foundational nature of Bitcoin to the cryptocurrency market, and to underscore its hugely outsized value when compared with other digital currencies.</div>
<div>It is used by traders to monitor sentiment within the crypto market. Clearly, the market cap of Bitcoin is an important indicator of how investors are feeling. However, Bitcoin price fluctuations are also often indicative of changes in sentiment across the wider crypto market — meaning insights can be gleaned from the Bitcoin Dominance Index that may be applicable to altcoins too.</div>
<div>There are some factors that investors should bear in mind when consulting the Bitcoin Dominance Index. In particular, there is some disagreement regarding the ultimate use of market cap as a metric. This is because of the high proportion of Bitcoin that is dormant — coins that are sitting in unused or lost wallets, or that the holders have forgotten they have. This is a problem that is exacerbated every time there is a huge price spike and new, amateur investors buy coins, only to forget about their holdings shortly after. The high levels of dormant Bitcoin (as much as 30% of all coins mined, according to some estimates) make market cap a potentially unreliable metric.</div>
<div>However, Bitcoin's market capitalization remains a powerful illustration of the vast and growing size of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, and of its importance proportionate to other cryptocurrencies. There are many projects aiming to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin, some of which (particularly Ethereum) offer more advanced applications for blockchain technology than the creation of coins that simply store value.</div>

<h2>Who Is Dorian Nakamoto?</h2>
<div>Dorian Nakamoto is a Japanese-American physicist who has been pointed out in some publications as the possible “face behind bitcoin.” This belief began with Newsweek’s article, written by Leah McGrath Goodman, claiming that Dorian is the real Satoshi Nakamoto. According to Goodman, one of the most glaring points supporting this claim is Dorian’s birth name, which is coincidentally Satoshi Nakamoto.</div>
<p>According to his daughter, Nakamoto was fired from a job twice in the 1990s, which made him become a libertarian. He later encouraged his daughter to create her own company &quot;not under the government's thumb.&quot;</p>
<p>Dorian was considered the likeliest candidate for being Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder for his lack of denial when questioned about Bitcoin. Instead, Dorian answered “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.” </p>
<p>Dorian later denied all claims, stating that he had never heard of Bitcoin up until that point in his interview and that his answer to Goodman’s question was the result of a misinterpretation. </p>
<div>Interestingly, Dorian later claimed that he had misinterpreted Goodman’s question as being related to his work in the military, then, later on, said it was his work on Citibank that he thought Goodman was referring to. That same day, the real Satoshi’s P2P Foundation account made its first comment in five years, which read “I am not Dorian Nakamoto.”</div>
<div>To thicken the Satoshi plot, Dorian Nakamoto lived only a few blocks from prime Satoshi candidate Hal Finney in Temple City, CA.</div>

<title>Double Spend Attack</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/double-spend-attack</url>
<file>double-spend-attack.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A double-spend attack is a practice in the world of digital currencies where a user gains the ability to spend the same cryptocurrency more than once.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Double Spend Attack?</h2>
<div>A transaction that utilizes the same input as another transaction that has previously been verified on the network is known as double-spending.</div>
<div>A cryptocurrency is like a digital record that is relatively simple to duplicate. Users can effortlessly copy digital files and use them to make purchases because there is no centralized authority to oversee transactions.</div>
<div>Not every cryptocurrency is exposed to double-spending attacks, however, many projects which use the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism are highly at risk.</div>
<div>Expert programmers who are well-versed with the blockchain protocol can modify or replicate digital information more readily which is why double-spending is most frequently linked with Bitcoin. Bitcoin uses a peer-to-peer method of trade that does not transit through any intermediaries or institutions which makes it an easy target for double-spending attacks by hackers.</div>
<div>In a classic bitcoin double-spend attack, the hacker duplicates the original transaction to make it look original and utilizes it in another transaction while retaining the original currency in their wallet or sometimes deleting the first transaction altogether.</div>
<div>Reversal of a transaction after acquiring the counterparty's assets or services is another technique to conduct a Bitcoin double-spend. It allows the hacker to keep both the received assets and the provided bitcoin (which should’ve been sent to the other party). To make it appear as though the transactions never occurred, the attacker sends numerous packets (data units) to the network, thus making it look like nothing happened in the first place.</div>
<div>There are several types of double-spend attacks. Some of these include:</div>
<div>A Finney attack is a type of deceptive double-spend attack in which the merchant does not wait for the transaction to be confirmed. In this instance, a miner sends money from one wallet to the other but does not instantly verify the block. Then the user makes a purchase with the source wallet and the miner broadcasts the previously mined block, which contains the first transaction after the second transaction is triggered. </div>
<div>A 51% attack, also referred to as a majority attack, is a hypothetical scenario in which bad actors take control of more than 51% of the nodes in a network. It gives them the power to control the network by using the majority-based consensus mechanism. However, as a network gets larger, more dispersed, and valuable, a 51% attack becomes more complex and difficult to execute.</div>
<div>When an attacker initiates two contradictory transactions and merchants accept payments before getting block confirmations on the transaction, a race attack is achievable. At the same time, a competing transaction is broadcasted to the network, returning the same amount of cryptocurrency to the attacker, thereby invalidating the original transaction. In this instance, miners might validate the transaction against the wallet, preventing the merchant from receiving the funds.</div>
<div>Although the blockchain cannot completely prevent double-spending, it can act as a line of defense against double-spending attacks while an army of decentralized validator nodes overcome complex equations to authenticate that new transactions are not double-spent before they are indefinitely added to the network's permanent ledger.</div>

<preview>The potential for a digital currency to be spent twice.</preview>
<description>
<p>Double spending is an issue associated with digital currencies because of the relative ease with which data can be reproduced, and the increasing availability of the computing power required to do so. </p>
<div>This event can occur in a cryptocurrency when it is disrupted by bad actors. Most commonly, thieves send multiple packets related to a transaction to the currency’s network, but then reverse those transactions with the intention of making it appear that they never occurred.</div>
<p>Double spending was one of the primary concerns associated with digital currencies when they first emerged. The first experiments began in the 1980s, but they never gained much traction — primarily because of the double spending problem.</p>
<div>Bitcoin, however, is now considered to have solved double spending. It achieves this through the requirement that all transactions are recorded on the blockchain. This record is theoretically immutable because every new block mined has to contain references to previous blocks. Because the blockchain is distributed across many thousands of computers and locations, the computing power required to make a single change to the ledger is so high that it is considered impossible to do so.</div>
<div>However, there have been challenges to Bitcoin's impermeability. On several occasions fraudsters have attempted to double spend through the use of sheer weight of computing power. On others, Bitcoin thieves have used other techniques to essentially steal cryptocurrency from poorly secured wallets. The latter is perhaps the most common form of fraud now occurring on the Bitcoin blockchain, and in the wider crypto sector.</div>

<title>Drawdown</title>

<file>drawdown.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The maximum reduction in value from the peak value for an investment or fund that has occurred over a period of time.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Drawdown?</h2>
<p>The term “drawdown” is usually used when referring to the maximum reduction in value from the peak value for an investment or fund that has occurred over a period of time. For example, over a period of three years, how much could an investment fall from its highest value? This maximum drop in value over the period is known as drawdown.</p>
<p>Calculating drawdown can indicate how risky an investment or fund is and help you make an informed decision as to whether it is right for you. The greater the potential of decrease in value, the riskier the fund. If you are concerned about volatility and want a smoother investment ride, you can opt for a fund with lower drawdowns.</p>
<p>Drawdown is a measure of an account's peak-to-valley decline during a specific recorded period of time. Drawdown represents the difference between the balance and equity at any given point in time, usually used in trading.</p>
<p>It can be used to test how robust a trading strategy or model is over that period, or as an estimate of how much equity capital would have been required to avoid drawdowns below certain thresholds.</p>
<p>Drawdown is calculated with the following formula:</p>
<p>MDD = (Trough Value — Peak Value) / Peak Value</p>
<h2>How to Calculate Drawdown?</h2>
<p>The first step in calculating drawdown is finding the largest peak in your equity curve. This will be the point of reference when calculating MDD.</p>
<p>Once you know where the highest peak in your equity curve is, you must find the lowest point. The difference between these two values divided by the highest point will give you your MDD. </p>
<p>For example, if account equity reaches $10,000 after a trade entry and then falls to $9,500 before rising again to $10,500 later on, we’ve had one drawdown of $500 or 5%. A lower MDD means less risk and that’s why it’s considered important by many traders.</p>
<p>While an investment's rate of return is important, it doesn't provide the full picture when considering how risky it is. An investment may have a high rate of return, but if its value falls significantly before rising again, investors would experience greater volatility and be more likely to sell at a loss. The drawdown provides investors with additional information to understand how much money they could lose on a particular investment.</p>
<p>Max drawdown is used primarily to assess risk in a portfolio of securities. A higher MDD indicates greater risk, while a lower MDD indicates lower risk. For example, if an investment fund has an average return of 10% but its maximum drawdown is -20%, it means that while the average annual return was good, there were times during which investors could have lost 20% on their investment – had they bought at the top and sold at the bottom.</p>
<p>The maximum drawdown can be calculated by either comparing daily trading prices or monthly account balances. The first method is more useful for traders, who want to know their maximum loss on daily basis, and the second method serves better for investors who are more interested in longer-term returns.</p>

<title>Dual-Token Economy/Model (Two-Token Economy)</title>

<file>dual-token-economy-model-two-token-economy.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>In the world of blockchain, a dual-token economy or model means a project with two tokens, one of which is used for utility inside the network and the other one as security to raise funds for</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Dual-Token Economy/Model (Two-Token Economy)?</h2>
<div>The dual-token economy, also referred to as the dual-token model or system, is a term used for crypto projects that offer two different types of tokens. The main idea behind creating tokens is to avoid compliance issues with regulators and divide the project's ecosystem into two tokens for better usability.</div>
<div>Typically, one of the two tokens is used as security to raise investment for the crypto project. The token does this by strictly following the regulations outlined for conventional securities, like bonds or stocks. The other token is used on the network to fulfill certain roles or activities. These roles usually differ from one project to another.</div>
<div>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission aspect is the main reason why crypto projects prefer to adopt a dual-token economy model. So far, the SEC has not clearly classified crypto assets, unlike securities, stocks, or bonds which have a clear standing in the SEC framework. </div>
<div>However, the ‘’Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets’’, has provided a way for blockchain projects to register their tokens as a security and set certain conditions for them to work in compliance with the regulations. </div>
<div>To be considered a security, the project has to make sure that its tokens offer real-world utility and profit to its holders and the project is completely decentralized. If all of these conditions are met, then the token is considered a security token by the SEC. </div>
<div>Another benefit of adopting the dual-token economy model is that it offers more incentives to token holders and potential investors than other projects in the industry. With two tokens, a crypto project can offer a better incentive structure, features, upgrades, and functionalities to the end-users.</div>
<div>A great example is Axie Infinity, an NFT gaming project that offers two tokens, SLP and AXS, both of which are offered as incentives to users for playing the game. In this case, the ‘’Small Love Potion’’ or SLP is a utility token with an unlimited supply that can be used by Axie Infinity players to perform in-game tasks like paying a breeding fee for their Axies (game characters) and purchasing Axies from the built-in marketplace. Meanwhile, AXS is an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie universe with a maximum supply of 27 million. AXS provides value to the Axie Infinity ecosystem where players can buy the token directly from crypto exchanges and the holders of AXS tokens can take part in in-game governance activities and stake their tokens on the platform to gain passive rewards. </div>
<div>Apart from Axie Infinity, there are many other projects that function on the dual-economy mechanism like VeChainThor, MakerDAO, Anchor, and Filmio. </div>

<description>
<h2>What is a Dump?</h2>
<div>A dump is where a substantial amount of cryptocurrency is sold off in quick succession, often by a whale. In some cases, these sell-offs will drag the price of an asset downwards.</div>
<div>The term often goes hand in hand with a pump and dump schemes, which are almost always associated with fraudulent activity and an attempt to artificially manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>A perfectly legitimate dump may also relate to the swift disposal of your own cryptocurrency holdings in order to draw instant profit.</p>
<p>A well-known example of a dump and the effect it can have came in December 2017, when Litecoin founder Charlie Lee sold his considerably holdings of LTC amid concerns that it amounted to a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>At first, the markets seemed nonplussed by the event. However, within days, LTC nosedived down a red line and lost almost half of its worth. It took weeks to recover the lost value.</p>

<file>dumping.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A collective market sell-off that occurs when large quantities of a particular cryptocurrency are sold in a short period of time.</preview>
<description>
<p>A dumping may occur when the market is spooked by outside factors such as economic turmoil in global markets, or even as a response to a particular news story.</p>
<div>Examples over the years have been the result of several factors. For instance, on the rare occasion when Bitcoin approaches a halving, the market can see great volatility that has historically been the trigger point for a dumping.</div>
<p>More notably, a dumping is likely when a cryptocurrency’s price repeatedly meets a point of resistance. Take May 2018, for example, when Bitcoin was in a robust period of upward movement to push it above the significant figure of $10,000. Again and again it bounced around the $10,100 mark, eventually nudging $10,200 where it hit a hard ceiling of rejection.</p>
<div>At this point, crypto whales —investors with unusually large amounts of coins — triggered a sell-off just under the $10,000 mark. This saw the value of the world’s most well-known cryptocurrency plummet in a matter of minutes.</div>
<p>It is likely those whales then re-entered the market to buy up more Bitcoin at a massively deflated price, resulting in huge profits.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Miniscule amounts of Bitcoin in a wallet — with a value that would be outweighed by the cost of a transaction fee.</preview>
<description>
<div>Dust, in cryptocurrency terms, refers to the tiny amounts of near-worthless assets that are scattered around the digital wallets of investors throughout the world.</div>
<div>This cumbersome collection of particles with little or no value may seem a perfectly innocent and acceptable by-product of digital currency, but it can be used in ways considered harmful to financial networks.</div>
<p>More often than not, the value of dust in a dust transaction will be significantly lower than the actual fee for moving the tiny particles. In many cases, this is the reason why these fractions end up gathering across wallets and rarely see the light of day.</p>
<div>Occasionally, a significant number of separate dust transactions will be maliciously used in what is known as a dusting attack — a deliberate act of transferring almost unnoticeable amounts of cryptocurrency to random wallets in order to then track activity within the wallet and break down the anonymity of its owner.</div>
<p>However, dust transactions are not entirely used nefariously. There are some charitable organizations, such as Dust Aid, which allow users to sweep up pockets of dust from their wallets and donate them to good causes.</p>

<description>
<div>A dusting attack is a malicious act designed to expose details of a cryptocurrency wallet’s owner by issuing a large number of miniscule transactions into a mass of private wallets.</div>
<div>It can be possible for an attacker to use the dust transaction to track activity within the wallet sufficiently enough to obtain information about the owner’s identity.</div>
<p>One such attack occurred in the summer of 2019, when hundreds of thousands of dust transactions were made within Litecoin wallets.</p>
<div>Fortunately, the source of the attack was identified before any harm was done. They later came forward to state their intention was to advertise their mining pool to the Litecoin community. Despite the harmless outcome, the incident did highlight the ease with which such attacks can be executed – particularly as attempts like the one on Litecoin can happen to any public blockchain.</div>
<p>Generally, attackers have recognized that a large proportion of cryptocurrency users pay very little attention to the almost microscopic amounts of funds they hold in dust.</p>
<div>Once they have dusted a wallet, they will then track data on the activity of the affected accounts in an attempt to uncover what organizations or individuals they are associated with. Hackers may then be able to use that information in phishing scams.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>DYCO (dynamic coin offering) is a new crowdfunding model developed by DAO Maker that employs utility tokens that are backed by USD.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a DYCO (Dynamic Coin Offering)?</h2>
<div>DYCO (dynamic coin offering) is a new crowdfunding model developed by DAO Maker that employs utility tokens that are backed by USD for the first 16 months of their lifespan in order to promote accountability from project developers. </div>
<div>Notably, the USD backing allows DYCO investors to refund their tokens in the event that the project  claim their share in case the project is not able to deliver a viable product. For example, if an investor sees that project developers veered off course, they can opt to return their allocated tokens and get their money back. Refunded tokens permanently leave circulation via burning, giving the project an adjusted valuation as the token supply is reduced, which in turn, increases each token's value.</div>
<p>The USD backing also provides a hedge against a token’s downward price movements while offering unlimited upward momentum. </p>
<p>Apart from targeting the primary market, DYCO has a second iteration called dynamic coin offering version two (DYCO v2), which focuses on building trust even on the secondary market. </p>
<div>In a DYCO v2, a smart contract distributes tokens to investors in the form of a toll bridge, catering to original buyers who have no intention to stay with the project long term. In such a case, it allows them to refund their allocations and exit during a project’s initial days. </div>
<p>Notably, a team that seeks investments through a DYCO has no power to alter the set refund dates. DYCO v2 fine-tunes this functionality by accounting for a project’s early growth without inconveniencing those who want to leave early and negatively affecting the secondary market’s confidence.</p>
<div>The first blockchain project to use this model was Orion Protocol.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The acronym of Do Your Own Research — encouraging investors to complete due diligence into a project before investing.</preview>
<description>
<div>Do Your Own Research (DYOR) is regarded as one of the most important aspects of being a cryptocurrency investor.</div>
<div>The term first became popular during a wave of ICO projects that flooded into the cryptocurrency space between 2016 and 2018. Many investors were left duped or out of pocket by a host of scams entering the market as potential get-rich-quick crowdfunding schemes.</div>
<p>As a way of combatting fraud, people were urged to ‘DYOR’ and investigate any potential investment fully before committing money to any project.</p>
<p>The phrase has now permeated into popular culture, and is widely used to encourage amateur investors in any arena to navigate a minefield of misinformation.</p>
<p>It is also often used as a kind of disclaimer by some cryptocurrency figures when they post about projects or analysis on social media platforms.</p>
<div>CoinMarketCap provides users with the necessary tools to DYOR. As the leading platform for cryptocurrency prices, ranking, market intelligence and research, it provides transparent details regarding coin rankings, token rankings, market capitalization, trading volumes and more.

<title>E-Signature</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/e-signature</url>
<file>e-signature.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>An electronic signature, or e-signature, is any electronic mark (sign, sound, symbol, etc.) used in the palace of a physical signature in signing a document or contract.</preview>
<description>
<p>Electronic signatures have become widely adopted as an alternative to physical ones. As technology advances and allows legal work to become more digital, e-signatures have become a go-to solution for a wide array of services. While electronic signatures vary based on jurisdiction and country, there are several requirements in common, adopted across the board. E-signatures need to effectively identify the signatory without a doubt, and the person signing has to be the sole owner of the private key for the signature.  </p>
<div>With technological advancements, new forms of e-signatures are being created. One of the most popular alternatives to an e-signature is a digital signature. Digital signatures are not the same as electronic signatures, although the former term is often used to describe the latter technology. While e-signatures are simply digital marks representing a physical signature, digital signatures employ the powers of cryptography to ensure validity. Digital signatures are also extremely important in the cryptocurrency world. They allow you to verify that you are the private key owner without actually revealing any information about the key itself. </div>
<p>Some e-signature services have started introducing cryptographic processes in order to boost their security. Some of the most common electronic signature providers include Adobe Sign and Hello Sign; however, with a growing demand for this technology over the past decade, more providers are entering the market. </p>
<p>Electronic signatures have been recognized as a legally accepted replacement for a physical signature for a long time. In 1996, the United Nations published the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce, which contained several sections detailing the use of electronic signatures. This was a highly influential document, which sped up the global adoption and legalization of e-signatures. Today, new forms of electronic signatures are being introduced as technology advances and more applications become available. </p>
<p>Biometric signatures are a popular type of e-signature. This type of signature relies on uniquely identifying physical qualities. For example, every time you unlock your phone with your fingerprint, you effectively use a biometric e-signature to verify that you have the right to use this phone. Face-identifying software also relies on biometric information to verify your identity, which means that your face can also serve as an electronic signature given the right software. </p>
<div>With the rise of cryptographic and blockchain technology, electronic signatures are becoming more advanced and start taking on characteristics of digital signatures. While several years ago it might have been hard to implement cryptographic features for simply signing a document, today, digital signatures are becoming more widely used.</div>

<preview>Economic utility is a term in economics that refers to the total satisfaction that a person can derive from consuming a good or service.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Economic Utility?</h2>
<div>Economic utility is a term in economics that refers to the total satisfaction that a person can derive from consuming a good or service. Modern economic theory posits four main types of utility: form, time, place, and possession.</div>
<div>Form utility refers to how well a product or service has been constructed to meet customers’ wants and needs. Secondly, time utility is when a company tries to match the availability of a good or service with the time-based increases in desire among customers. Thirdly, place utility refers to making goods or services physically available to potential customers. Finally, possession utility is the amount of use or perceived value that a consumer or owner gets from possessing a product.</div>
<p>Economic utility inheres not in the good or service itself but the relationship between the consumer’s wants and needs and the functionality of the good or service. For example, two meals when you’re hungry are not always better than one. The second meal might be just as good as the first but is much less useful if you are already full from the first meal.</p>

<title>Edge Nodes</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/edge-nodes</url>
<file>edge-nodes.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>In computer science, an edge node is a computer that serves as an end-user gateway to form a connection with other nodes.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Edge Nodes?</h2>
<div>Edge nodes, also known as edge communication nodes and gateway nodes, are cluster instances that connect the user's machine to the cluster's machines. They allow users to perform their jobs on the edge node rather than the master nodes, which are crucial to the system's general operation that helps in avoiding capacity losses on these nodes.</div>
<div>The interaction between the Hadoop cluster and the external network is provided by edge nodes. Edge nodes are mainly used to deploy cluster-admin tools and client applications to provide a uniform experience to everyone who has access to them.</div>
<div>You can utilize your required services without communicating to any other instance since every cluster program has a client deployed on every single edge node. As a result, the edge nodes are the only computers whose potential is influenced by user actions.</div>
<div>It allows you to offer each user their own node to use the cluster as an independent entity. It also enables for the re-spawning of a new edge node if the previous one has become sufficiently changed, even though an altered master can cause the entire cluster to be damaged.</div>
<div>Some nodes have critical activities that, if disrupted, might have a negative influence on performance. Edge nodes provide network access for the cluster, allowing end-users to communicate with worker nodes as needed without exposing the whole cluster to communication. This restriction enhances the dependability and security of the system. As work is fairly divided amongst work nodes, the edge node’s function helps minimize data skewing and performance problems.</div>
<div>Edge computing is a distributed information technology (IT) infrastructure in which client data is collected and processed close to the original source, meaning at the network's edge.</div>
<div>Various sorts of app/tool deployment will necessitate different types of hardware. To achieve their goals, industrial users, for example, will prioritize consistency and low latency, necessitating ruggedized edge nodes that can function in the harsh environment of a factory floor, as well as dedicated communication links (private 5G, dedicated Wi-Fi networks, or even wired connections).</div>
<div>For a unified shop management framework, retailers can employ edge nodes as an in-store clearinghouse for a variety of functions, such as connecting point-of-sale data with tailored advertising, monitoring foot traffic, and so on. The connectivity aspect might be straightforward, for example, in-house Wi-Fi for all devices, or even more sophisticated, with Bluetooth or other low-power connections handling traffic monitoring and promotional services and Wi-Fi retained for point-of-sale and self-checkout.</div>
<div>In the world of blockchain, edge computing and edge nodes can play their part to solve the challenges that arise in cryptocurrencies. A great example of this would be THETA (THETA) token which is deployed on the Theta Network with highly functioning Theta Network Edge Nodes. Edge nodes were implemented with the release of Theta 2.0 mainnet, which allows users to transcode and transmit video content as well as distribute surplus bandwidth and processing capability throughout the network without the necessity of centralized servers. Operators of Edge Nodes are rewarded with THETA tokens in return for their contributions to Theta's global content-sharing ecosystem.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Effective Proof-of-Stake?</h2>
<div>Harmony has introduced its own improvised version of the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which uses random state sharding to ensure decentralization. The purpose is to prevent the centralization of power by large stakeholders on the network.</div>
<h2>What Is the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism?</h2>
<p>The proof of stake consensus mechanism is a way for new blocks to be produced and prevents the double-counting issue.</p>
<p>The idea is that people who hold cryptocurrencies can stake them in order to validate transactions and get rewards.</p>
<div>Proof-of-stake is an alternative to proof-of-work, which requires miners to solve difficult problems in order to produce new blocks. Unlike proof of work, the difficulty of building a block on a proof of stake network increases with the number of coins staked by the validator.</div>
<p>For example, if someone has 1% of total network coins staking, then they would be expected to get 1% of all validation rewards.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Electrum Wallet?</h2>
<p>Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin wallet for Mac, Linux and Windows. Electrum was created in November 2011. Apart from desktop computers, it can be used on mobile devices as well. You can download it on your Android phone and enjoy the same features as you would on the desktop version.</p>
<p>The main features of Electrum are support for hardware wallets (such as TREZOR, Ledger Nano and KeepKey), and secure Bitcoin storage using an offline computer.</p>
<p>Electrum wallet requires you to have a little knowledge of Bitcoin and its working. It has some advanced functionality and a setup process where you need some technical knowledge to store and handle Bitcoin.</p>
<div>Electrum uses a simple interface to generate standard transactions that are fully compatible with other Bitcoin clients. It also supports third-party plugins including multisig services, hardware wallets, etc.</div>
<p>Electrum is focused on providing speed and simplicity, without burning excessive resources. It relies on remote servers to deal with such parts of the Bitcoin network that are complicated. When you install it on your computer, you’re given a secret recovery phrase. If anything happens to your computer, you can recover your funds using this phrase. However, it’s important you keep this phrase saved somewhere safe. </p>
<div>Electrum is a hot wallet, which is considered less secure than a cold wallet. It can be hacked or compromised by a malicious actor. If a hacker gets access to your private keys (the code that lets you move your cryptocurrency), they can steal your crypto.</div>
<p>Electrum wallet offers excellent service as a Bitcoin storage solution, particularly to those who seek a combination of ease of use and security. Electrum desktop wallet has a strong reputation in the industry and many Bitcoin users rely on its reputation. The wallet is well established and highly trusted among people in the cryptocurrency industry. It excels at both security and user privacy, which are typically the most important aspects to be considered in crypto wallets. </p>

<file>eli5.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Short for “explain like I’m five” — a plea for simplicity when crypto concepts are being explained.</preview>
<description>
<div>While the expression “explain like I’m five” (ELI5) predates even the Satoshi white paper, it has now become synonymous with cryptocurrency and blockchain.</div>
<p>This is largely due to the daunting complexities involved in most of the processes surrounding the technology.</p>
<p>The concept of ELI5 has been adopted to allow people involved in crypto to be able to pause a conversation in order to have a particular aspect of the technology explained in the simplest of terms before moving on with the discussion.</p>
<p>The origin of the phrase goes back to a famous Albert Einstein quote. He said: “If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, then you don’t understand it yourself.”</p>
<p>His point was, of course, that if you have a good enough understanding of something, you should be able to break it down in simple enough terms for a young child to comprehend properly. He also wanted to get the point across that a person can still explain a complex subject without using complicated words.</p>
<p>A version of Einstein’s quote was later popularized in the TV comedy The Office where characters regularly used the line: “Why don’t you explain it to me like I’m five.”</p>
<p>The U.S. version of the show was airing during the embryonic years of cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology that underpins it, ensuring the expression was embedded into the tech lexicon.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Are Elliott Waves?</h2>
<div>The Elliott Wave Theory, an essential tool for many stock and crypto market traders, was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s after observing recurring fractal wave patterns. It is a technical analysis theory used to describe price movements in the financial market by looking at persistent changes in investor sentiment and psychology. Stock markets, which were generally thought to behave in a random manner, were found to trade in repetitive patterns called waves. Investors trying to identify market trends are said to be ‘riding a wave’. </div>
<div>Elliott, who turned his attention to the stock market after retiring at the age of 58 due to poor health, found that the same patterns were related to mass swings in investor psychology and almost always mirrored the recurring fractal patterns in financial markets. The Elliott Wave Theory resembles the Dow Theory in that both recognize that stock prices move in waves. However, because Elliott was able to recognize the pattern’s fractal element, he was able to break them down and study them in more detail. Fractals are a mathematical structure that infinitely repeats themselves. By seeing this, it was also possible to use the patterns as predictive indicators of future market movement.</div>
<p>According to the theory, there are various types of waves. An impulse wave, which travels in the same direction as the overall trend, always shows five waves in its pattern. On the other hand, a corrective wave flows in the opposite direction. The next pattern repeats itself infinitely on ever-smaller scales, hence its fractal nature.</p>

<preview>Exponential moving average (EMA) is a technical indicator that highlights the recent price changes and data points of an asset/stock/cryptocurrency while keeping the older chart observations</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an EMA (Exponential Moving Average)?</h2>
<div>Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that gives greater importance to the recent price data. Therefore, it is preferred by traders who are looking for recent price changes of an asset.</div>
<div>Unlike other moving averages, the exponential moving average (EMA) behaves quickly when the price of asset changes in the financial market. An EMA line is drawn by using the indicator and is used by traders who want to observe and act on the latest changes in the price of a particular asset/stock/cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>The graph of an exponential moving average (EMA) usually consists of three lines:</p>
<div></div>
<div>Whenever the candles are above the EMA lines, it represents an uptrend or in simple words, a bullish signal. Notice how the yellow line is reacting to the sudden price changes in the chart above? Observe from the left side, how two candles formed above the yellow EMA line and a bullish pattern followed. The price of this asset remained bullish as long as it didn’t come down enough to cross the purple EMA line. However, towards the end of the graph, a large candle went below the purple line and the market continued to fall. This is why EMA is highly rated by traders as it allows them to predict the next price by analyzing recent price patterns of the asset in the financial markets.</div>
<h2>Why Is Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Used?</h2>
<div>EMA is one of the top technical trading indicators that have a reputation for predicting the direction of the market. EMAs are frequently used in combination with other technical indicators to confirm and assess important market changes. It is particularly effective for traders who prefer to trade in fast-moving markets. This indicator is frequently used to detect a trading bias. </div>
<div>The calculation of EMA is a bit difficult since an EMA gives the most recent price inputs. Even though both EMA and SMA (Small Moving Averages) contribute significantly, EMA is more sensitive to market reversals and rapid price changes.</div>
<h2>What Is the Best Setting for EMA (Exponential Moving Average)? </h2>
<p>The ideal settings for Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are the following: </p>
<h2>Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Formula</h2>
<p>Here’s how you can calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA):</p>
<div></div>
<p>Where EMA = Exponential Moving Average</p>
<p>Smoothing = 2</p>
<div>You can increase the smoothing factor if you want the recent price observations to have a greater influence on the EMA technical indicator.</div>
<div>EMA is not the only technical indicator used by traders when they are analyzing the charts of an asset in the financial markets. Other commonly used indicators (TA’s) include relative strength index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), on-balance volume (OBV indicator), Aroon indicator, and the stochastic oscillator. Every one of these indicators works on a different mechanism where some give more weightage to price, others focus on volume, while some of these consider both variables. While trading it is beneficial to use a variety of indicators before investing in any asset.</div>

<title>Email Spoofing</title>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Email spoofing is a technique that is used in order to trick users into thinking that a message actually came from a different person.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Email Spoofing?</h2>
<p>Email spoofing is a technique that is used in spam as well as phishing attacks in order to trick users into thinking that a message actually came from a person or an entity, typically one they can trust, or simply know in the real world. In spoofing attacks specifically, the sender forges email headers so that client software displays the fraudulent sender address, where most of the users take at face value.</p>
<p>Unless a user ends up inspecting the header closely, which is rarely the case, they can see the forged sender in the message. If it is a name they recognize, they are more likely to trust it, and as such, they have the potential of clicking on malicious links, open malware attachments, and even send sensitive data and wire corporate funds.</p>
<p>Email spoofing has been made possible due to the fact that email systems are designed in a specific way. Outgoing messages are assigned a sender address through the client application, while outgoing email servers have no way to tell if the sender address is actually legitimate or spoofed. The recipient servers, as well as anti-malware software, can help detect and even filter spoofed messages; however, not every email service out there has implemented all of the security protocols. Users can review email headers which are packaged with just about every message out there and determine if the sender address is actually forged.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that email spoofing has been an issue ever since the early 1970s, and it started with spammers that used it to get around email filters. The issue, however, grew in popularity throughout the 1990s and is now a significant cybersecurity issue throughout the entirety of the 2000s to present day.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The speed at which new coins are produced and released.</preview>
<description>
<div>Emission refers to how quickly new cryptocurrencies are released.</div>
<div>As an example, let’s take a look at Bitcoin. A new block is added to its blockchain every 10 minutes. When the cryptocurrency first launched, miners were rewarded with 50 BTC for every block that was validated — meaning that the emission rate of BTC was approximately 7,200 a day.</div>
<div>A series of halving events have taken place over recent years, meaning that the number of new Bitcoin that’s entering the ecosystem has decreased substantially. As of May 2020, this stands at just 6.25 BTC.</div>
<div>Emissions aren’t guaranteed to continue forever, and in Bitcoin’s case, the last-ever BTC will be mined in 2140 because it has a maximum supply of 21 million and a set schedule for release.</div>
<div>Some cryptocurrencies have no set rate of emission, meaning that new units can be created on demand. A good example of this is the Tether stablecoin, which is created whenever someone places $1 in reserve.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Encryption?</h2>
<p>Encryption is a method through which information can be made into code that hides the information of its true meaning. The science behind encrypting as well as decrypting information is known as cryptography</p>
<p>In the world of computing, unencrypted data is typically referred to as plaintext data, and encrypted data can be referred to as ciphertext. </p>
<p>Encryption can also be defined as the process of changing electronic information or signals into a secret code, which is a system of letters, numbers or symbols where people cannot understand or use without special equipment.</p>
<p>Encryption is a way of scrambling data so that it can only be accessed by authorized parties, more specifically, only by people who have a specific set of privileges in order to view that information. Encryption essentially takes the previously mentioned plaintext data and makes it appear as if it were random data. It requires the use of a cryptographic key, which by itself is a set of mathematical values that both the sender as well as the recipient of the encrypted message can agree on.</p>
<p>If you had a plaintext that said &quot;Cryptocurrency&quot; for example, and it was encrypted, the ciphertext would potentially read SHSF#R&amp;#244243, making it impossible to understand. </p>
<p>While to you, the encryption data may appear random, it is actually a logical, predictable way of allowing a party that receives the encrypted data and processes the right key to encrypt the data. This would turn it back into plaintext for that specific party. </p>
<p>The most highly secured encryption method will use keys that are complex enough that a third party will be unlikely to decrypt or break the ciphertext through using brute force, or in other words, by using a bot that can attempt to guess the key itself. </p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, encryption is often used to secure the password of your private key.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Enterprise Blockchain?</h2>
<div>Enterprise blockchain is the use of distributed ledger technology for non-speculative business purposes. Tailored for the needs of enterprises, these chains may be private or public. While virtually any business can use blockchain, specific industries are more likely to benefit than others, for example, industries that deal with issues of identity or IP security, such as insurance or legal firms, or companies that work with supply chains. </div>
<div>Most businesses prefer to use a private blockchain environment for their needs. There are several advantages to this, including privacy, reliable transaction speeds and low transaction costs - things that public blockchains cannot guarantee. In fact, many public chains may even be cost-prohibitive for businesses that require high transaction volumes. On the other hand, public blockchains, like Ethereum, give businesses the chance to use widely available dApps and token protocols. </div>
<p>Blockchain technology has a lot to offer modern businesses, especially in consortiums or collaborative industries. Distributed ledgers reduce the vulnerabilities and costs from data silos, and are inherently secure, offering a level of protection that other digital systems can’t match. At the same time, blockchains are easily auditable, keeping companies compliant and transparent. This transparency and record-keeping also help management monitor data flow. </p>
<p>Finally, enterprises can also make use of all the other benefits that come with blockchains, such as access to digitalization/tokenization tools, digital asset management, and programmatic barter systems. As business becomes increasingly global and digital, blockchain can help companies safely and efficiently scale and cross the physical/digital divide. </p>

<description>
<h2>What is the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)?</h2>
<div>EEA groups several technology companies, financial institutions, start-ups and academics with the goal of promoting the use of Ethereum technology and driving new business opportunities worldwide.</div>
<p>Its global community includes a mix of multinational giants as well as start-ups. JPMorgan Chase is a member, as are Microsoft, Intel, Accenture, EY and BP.</p>
<p>Through the alliance, members have created a forum where they can share knowledge and foster the widespread adoption of Ethereum among institutional players.</p>
<div>EEA’s operations rely on four pillars: understanding the requirements of businesses, building standard specifications that address these requirements, evolving alongside the public Ethereum blockchain, and achieving global interoperability through certification programs.</div>
<div>Ethereum’s technology is still at an early stage and will have to overcome several technical and regulatory hurdles before it becomes fully functional for business transactions. However, work has begun on upgrading this blockchain and making it into a Proof-of-Stake network — something that should mean it can handle far more transactions per second than at present.</div>
<p>Just some of the potential use cases touted by the EEA include blockchains being used to promote food safety. This technology can be used at every stage along a supply chain, delivering greater transparency to consumers. In the event that products need to be recalled, advocates argue that this can speed up the process — and ensure that the source of a problem can be identified far faster than at present.</p>
<div>Blockchain also brings the opportunity to tokenize a wide range of assets, including real-world items such as property. Health records could also end up being held more securely than at present, and university degrees could be tokenized to prevent fraud.</div>
<p>The EEA is based in the U.S., but also has offices in China, France and Japan.</p>

<title>Epoch</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/epoch</url>
<file>epoch.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>One entire run of the training dataset through the algorithm is referred to as an epoch in machine learning.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Epoch?</h2>
<div>In the world of artificial neural networks, an epoch is one loop of the whole training dataset. Training a neural network typically takes many epochs. To put it simply, if we supply a neural network with training data in diverse patterns over more than one epoch, we expect improved generalization when we give it a fresh unobserved input (test data).</div>
<div>The dataset's underlying parameters of the model are changed with each epoch. As a result, the batch gradient descent learning algorithm is named after each batch of the epoch. Batch size is usually 1 or greater, and it is always an integer value in the epoch number. It may alternatively be represented as a for-loop with a certain number, with each loop route traversing the whole training dataset.</div>
<div>When the sample &quot;batch size&quot; value is given as one, the for-loop contains a layer that enables it to run through a specified sample in a single batch. Establishing how many epochs a model should execute to train is reliant on several parameters linked to both the data and the model's objective. To convert this procedure into an algorithm, a thorough understanding of the data is typically required.</div>
<div>When a complete dataset is transmitted forward and then back through the neural network, it is called an Epoch. We break the epoch into multiple smaller batches because one epoch is too large to send to the computer all at once.</div>
<div>Inside a blockchain network, an epoch is considered a specific period of time.</div>
<div>This period of time is used to specify when specific events in a blockchain network will occur, such as when incentives will be distributed or when a new group of validators will be assigned to validate transactions. Every blockchain protocol defines that period of time differently. It is generally referred to as the time it takes for a certain amount of blocks on the chain to be completed.</div>
<div>In the Ethereum (ETH) protocol, for instance, an epoch is the time taken for 30,000 blocks to be completed on the chain. The length of an epoch is determined by the pace with which transactions are processed and agreements are reached, however, at about 100 hours, the pace remains relatively constant.</div>
<div>Another example would be the Cardano blockchain system, where an epoch is referred to as a unit of time. Cardano (ADA) employs Ouroboros Praos, a customized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus method that splits the blockchain into five-day epochs. Epochs are then divided into slots, where each of these consists of 20-second intervals. Each epoch presently has 432,000 slots (five days) available. </div>

<preview>Equity is the funds that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all of the company's assets were dissolved and all debts were paid off in the event of liquidation.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Equity?</h2>
<div>In the world of finance, equity refers to the worth of a company that can be attributed to its shareholders. On a firm's balance sheet, equity reflects the shareholders' ownership of the company. It is calculated by subtracting a company's total assets from its total liabilities.</div>
<p>Equity = Total Assets − Total Liabilities</p>
<div>There are two forms of equity; book value &amp; market value.</div>
<div>Equity is usually stated in a financial statement under its market value, which might be much greater or lower than the book value. The rationale for this distinction is that accounting statements are backward-looking whereas financial analysts estimate what they expect financial growth will be in the future. </div>
<div>The market value of a company's stock is used to determine if it is publicly tradable. It's just the most recent share price compounded by the total number of outstanding shares. When a firm is privately held, determining its market value is significantly more difficult. If a company has to be formally evaluated, it employs specialists to do a detailed examination, such as investment bankers, accounting companies, or valuation firms.</div>
<div>In principle, a company's book value of equity is determined by the industry in which it works and how it maintains its assets. Since they can generate comparatively high profits from their assets, companies that are projected to expand and earn larger profits in the future often have a book value that is lower than their market value, i.e. the worth of the business established by the stock market.</div>
<div>Companies that are less oriented towards growth and more towards value have a higher book value of equity than their market value. In reality, this indicates that the market isn't optimistic about the company's potential to create profits in the future, but value investors feel that the market is completely mistaken.</div>
<p>Investing in a company that offers its equity shares is extremely beneficial in the following ways:</p>
<div>In the world of crypto, investors can choose to acquire tokens/coins of a cryptocurrency project and stake them to receive a recurring stream of revenue. The quantity of rewards depends on the total equity or tokens they own of the cryptocurrency.</div>

<title>Erasure Encoding</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erasure-encoding</url>
<file>erasure-encoding.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Erasure coding is a method of storing data at multiple locations after doing its segmentation, expansion, and encoding with redundant information.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Erasure Encoding?</h2>
<p>Erasure encoding is a simple and fast method to encode data in a lossless format. </p>
<p>Erasure code offers a failure-free storage environment. It is a form of information dispersal algorithm that allows data to be distributed across multiple storage devices. The idea behind erasure coding is simple: rather than writing data to storage in its entirety, it is broken into smaller chunks, which are then used to reconstruct the original data if needed. </p>
<p>Erasure codes can work at different levels of granularity; for example, an entire file can be encoded as K chunks, or a file system block can be encoded as K independent blocks.</p>
<p>The main advantage of the erasure encoding is that it can be decoded even if some blocks are missing, or not received at all. It is used in different communication systems to improve the robustness against transmission errors.</p>
<h2>What Is the Difference Between RAID and Erasure Encoding?</h2>
<p>For some reason, RAID and erasure encoding are mistaken as the same things. In reality, both are quite different. </p>
<div>RAID is mostly used for servers and other large storage devices. It mirrors your data across multiple hard drives, so if one drive fails, you have a backup. The downside is that it is more expensive than erasure encoding and utilizes more space on each drive.</div>
<p>RAID doesn't actually protect the data on your drives from being read by another computer. Anyone who can get their hands on one of the drives can still see all your information. Erasure encoding does exactly what it sounds like: It scrambles the data so no one can read it without the right key.</p>
<p>Erasure encoding breaks your data into segments and expands and encodes it with redundant information. On the other hand, data isn’t broken apart in RAID.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Erasure Encoding</h2>
<div>Erasure coding is a way of storing data in a reliable manner that can be used to recover the original data should any portion of the storage medium become damaged. There are many benefits of erasure encoding that make it an attractive alternative to other data storage methods. </div>
<p>The key features of erasure coding include:</p>
<div>Scalability – This technique can be applied to both small and large amounts of data.</div>
<div>Reliability – Since it keeps only fragments of data, the original one can be recovered even if some of the storage media has failed.</div>
<div>Cost-effective – This technique is cost-effective when you consider the cost savings associated with not needing to purchase additional backup and recovery software.</div>
<div>Speed – The time needed to recover from a single failure is much shorter when erasure encoding is used compared with other methods.</div>

<file>erc-1155.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>ERC-1155 digital token standard was created by Enjin and offers more security in comparison to older token standards.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is ERC-1155?</h2>
<div>ERC-1155 tokens are secure, tradable, and resistant to hacking, thanks to their use of the Ethereum network. ERC-1155 can be used to create fungible tokens, which offer utility in the form of currency on various platforms. </div>
<div>ERC-1155 includes optimizations that make transactions more efficient and secure. Transactions could be bundled, lowering the cost of transferring tokens. ERC-1155 is an upgrade of older token standards, including ERC-20 and ERC-721.</div>
<div>Ethereum's ERC-20 (for fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (for non-fungible tokens, NFT) token standards are widely used in the ecosystem. Just take a look at Etherscan to see the massive number of tokens that have been built using these standards. Both of these, however, have limitations, some of which are quite severe.</div>
<div>The ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens are not interchangeable. In fact, the contracts are so dissimilar that adding functionality that connects the two would be a daunting task, with a high risk of network disruption, failure, and commission costs. It would be much easier to program a more secure and less complex design if a single smart contract could handle everything.</div>
<div>Here is when ERC-1155 was created in order to unite both worlds under a single contract, overcoming the limitations already mentioned and making their management more efficient. </div>
<div>The strict set of rules that a token must follow allows for an incredible feature of the ERC-1155 token standard. These tokens are the first type that is capable of executing a deterministic smart contract function simply by sending a token to an address.</div>
<div>Simply sending a token to a DEX exchange address could result in the exchange immediately returning another token to the sender's address. Tokens could be wrapped, converted, crafted, or escrowed without having to interact directly with the smart contract.</div>
<p>All a user has to do is send their token to a specific address to set off a fantastic chain of events.</p>
<div>The secure token transfer is one of the most promising features of the ERC-1155 token which is accomplished through a function that verifies that the transaction was completed successfully, and in case it wasn’t fulfilled, the tokens involved in the transaction are reverted back to their issuer.</div>
<div>This is especially useful when we make a mistake in the transcription or copying of addresses and instead send our tokens to an incorrect address, rendering our transaction inoperable. The transfer is void in that case, and the issuer recovers the tokens, allowing it to verify the address again and retry the operation. There are also a number of rules in place to prevent double-spend attacks.</div>
<div>When compared to ERC-20 and ERC-721, the utility and technical superiority of ERC-1155 appears to be enormous, indicating that it will gradually take on more and more space.</div>

<preview>Tokens designed and used solely on the Ethereum platform.</preview>
<description>
<div>ERC-20 tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain. Just like mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, they can be used to make purchases — or traded for fiat currencies and crypto.</div>
<div>These assets, which usually have a fixed supply, can be stored in a dedicated Ethereum wallet. A wide range of ERC-20 tokens were created in 2017 and 2018 during the boom of initial coin offerings. They usually form the backbone of decentralized apps, otherwise known as DApps for short.</div>
<div>Generally speaking, ERC-20 tokens are fungible — meaning that each of them are identical and can be easily exchanged. Nonfungible tokens are often referred to using the ERC-721 standard, meaning each of these tokens have unique characteristics that set them apart from others.</div>
<p>The ERC-20 standard comes with strict conditions that must be followed. This isn’t too dissimilar to the internet, where websites won’t work properly unless they are fully compliant with HTTP.</p>
<p>Just some of the use cases for ERC-20 tokens include as in-game assets, and these assets have also been shaping up the world of loyalty points.</p>
<div>The sheer level of versatility that ERC-20 tokens offer is one of the reasons why these tokens have become so popular. In order to succeed and achieve liquidity and widespread awareness, these assets often need to launch on an exchange where they can easily be traded.</div>

<file>erc-223.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>ERC-223 is an Ethereum token standard that is powered by smart contracts that enable users to securely transfer tokens to a digital wallet.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is ERC-223?</h2>
<div>ERC-223 is an expansion of the ERC-20 protocol, and was created as a solution to the ERC-20 bug by an Ethereum developer whose Reddit username is "Dexaran". </div>
<div>ERC stands for &quot;Ethereum Request for Comment&quot;. The ERC 223 token platform is powered by smart contracts and enables users to securely transfer tokens to a digital wallet.</div>
<div>The fact that Ethereum has established tokenization standards simplifies the process. Depending on what the application is intended to do, different types can be tokenized using different standards.</div>
<div>Some popular Ethereum tokens include the ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-777 standards.</div>
<div>While the ERC-20 standard is extremely useful, it is far from ideal. For example, one particularly egregious design flaw in ERC-20 allowed tokens to be lost when people sent them to a smart contract by mistake using the same process they would use to send tokens to an ordinary wallet. </div>
<div>Unfortunately, this has already resulted in the loss of more than $3 million in ERC-20 tokens.</div>
<div>This design flaw is addressed by ERC-223, which allows users to transfer tokens to smart contracts and wallets that perform the same function. Furthermore, ERC-223 tokens outperform ERC-20 tokens in terms of efficiency by requiring only one step rather than two for transactions. </div>
<div>ERC-223 retains all of the original functionality while addressing the aforementioned bugs. The new standard introduces enhancements and capabilities that address some of the most serious ERC-20 issues, particularly when interacting with other smart contracts.</div>
<div>The transfer function of the ERC-223 includes a parameter that makes sure that the destination address is a smart contract. If this is the case, the transaction calls the token Fallback function in the smart contract and that can be returned to the sender's account using this function, after which the tokens are then transferred to the smart contract.</div>
<p>No tokens are lost because the updated transfer function now works for smart contracts as well.</p>
<div>Here are some benefits of the ERC-223 token:</div>
<p>ERC-223 can be thought of as a superset of ERC-20, but only time will tell which token will become the Ethereum ecosystem's ultimate standard.</p>

<preview>A token standard for non-fungible Ethereum tokens.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is ERC-721?</h2>
<p>ERC-721 refers to a token standard that can be found on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>The more common term used to refer to these assets is non-fungible tokens — an asset class that exploded in popularity in late 2020 and early 2021.</p>
<p>Non-fungible tokens (or NFTs for short) refer to tokens that have unique characteristics, setting them apart from other tokens.</p>
<p>A $10 note is an example of something that is fungible. If you lend one of these banknotes to a friend, you don’t need to receive the exact same one back as they are all identical.</p>
<p>A plane ticket or a trading card is an example of something non-fungible. Although two plane tickets may look the same, one may offer an economy trip to New York, while another will guarantee you a first-class trip to Barbados. As a result, they cannot be swapped on a like-for-like basis.</p>
<p>ERC-721 tokens help bring this concept to the blockchain, ensuring that distinctive details about an asset can be immortalized. NFTs can be used to provide digital representation of a one-of-a-kind artwork, with ownership that is easily proved through blockchain records. This can help clamp down on counterfeiting.</p>
<p>There is a firm belief in the Ethereum community that ERC-721 could have a number of exciting applications — far beyond the collectible CryptoKitties that made this asset class famous. A number of rival blockchains (Binance Smart Chain being one of them) have also released token standards that offer similar characteristics to ERC-721.</p>

<file>erc-777.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>ERC-777 is a tradable token standard spun out from ERC-20 to enable a new way to engage with a token contract while staying backward compatible.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is ERC-777?</h2>
<div>ERC-777 is a token standard for fungible tokens introduced on the Ethereum network that is fully compatible with existing decentralized exchanges.</div>
<p>In simpler words, the ERC-777 tokenization standard refers to Ethereum's blockchain protocol that specifies the type of tokens compatible with ETH. </p>
<div>It facilitates complicated token trade interactions and assists the removal of ambiguity around decimals, minting, and burning. It utilizes a distinctively effective feature called a hook. </div>
<div>When tokens are delivered to a computer-based analytical contract, it activates a hook mechanism that streamlines how accounts and contracts communicate when receiving tokens. Furthermore, ERC-777 tokens are significantly less likely to get stuck in a contract, which is traditionally seen as a problem with ERC-20 tokens.</div>
<div>ERC777, like ERC20, is a standard for generating tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. Hooks are programmed into the standard. If you transfer ETH to a smart contract, it will be alerted about the incoming ETH through the hooks, a feature that ERC20 tokens don’t have. The following are the benefits of this standard:</div>
<div>Despite the fact that ERC-777 had some early security problems that have already been resolved, it may have certain drawbacks, just like any other token. This is the reason, updated versions, such as ERC-820, have already been introduced.</div>
<p>We can transmit tokens to any Ethereum address, which essentially implies that we can send tokens to contracts that do not support them, thereby locking them forever.</p>
<p>What appears to be a problem is that, even if the tokens may be manually moved, it appears to be difficult to determine which tokens originated from whom and who sent them back.</p>

<preview>ERC-827 is an ETH token standard that addresses the existing limitations of ERC 20 when it comes to the implementation of calls in transfers and approvals in particular.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is ERC-827?</h2>
<div>ERC-827 is one of the many token standards developed on the Ethereum network to facilitate the network's various token contracts. ERC-827 is an updated version of the Ethereum network's currently existing stable token ERC20. </div>
<div>Under the present ERC20 paradigm only values may be exchanged. ERC827, on the other hand, allows Ethereum users to transmit currency and data. It also allows tokens to be authorized for spending by other on-chain third-party companies.</div>
<div>It is a unique token standard that would enable transactions to be completed using the success of a recipient contract mechanism. It contains transferAndCall, transferFromAndCall, and approveAndCall functions in addition to the regular ERC20 operations. In addition to the basic ERC 20 parameters, they all contain an additional _data parameter. It works similarly to ERC 677, as it also utilizes a fallback method, it calls the function supplied in the _data parameter and begins the transaction if the function returns true.</div>
<p>Since it's an extension of ERC 20, all the other functions are similar.</p>
<div>It will mostly be used for third-party apps built on the Ethereum blockchain, and it competes with ERC 223 for general adoption. It addresses the same problems as ERC 223 and allows users to pass data and tokens to smart contracts and execute them. This means that it may be used to tackle problems other than tokens becoming stuck in smart contracts. </div>
<p>ERC 827 appears to be gaining more attention over ERC 223 in recent times, as it has been incorporated by Zeppelin in its open-source contracts, whilst ERC 223 is still not present in the tokens offered by them.</p>
<div>Consider a fictional shopping cart on a merchant's website to better understand how ERC 827 tokens are used. Items waiting to be purchased are stored in a shopping cart. However, it cannot proceed to checkout unless the user has the necessary amount of tokens. When someone transfers tokens to the cart's owner, certain data is provided along with the cart, which calls another function included within the contract that checks if the cart owner has the adequate balance to checkout the products saved in the cart.</div>
<div>This new ERC20 superset is intriguing and has the potential to revolutionize our perception of the token standard, as it addresses some of the most serious issues while maintaining its compatibility with ERC20 tokens. ERC827 is more likely to be popular among new projects. </div>
<div>Users will not only be able to reap the benefits of the new standard, but they will also be able to continue utilizing the ERC20 token standard that they have become accustomed to. It's a win-win situation. Its usefulness and efficiency are also significant advantages for this new standard.</div>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>ERC-884 facilitates the creation of tradable ERC-20 tokens, each of which symbolizes a numberless share issued by a Delaware corporation.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is ERC-884?</h2>
<div>Each ERC-884 token defines a specific share in a Delaware company, according to David Sag's standard. The standard is designed for equity transactions, and the token's proprietor must be whitelisted, which is a method built into the smart contract. ERC-884 issuers, on the other hand, must establish an off-chain private database to meet with securities legislation.</div>
<div>Companies in the US state of Delaware can now utilize blockchain technology to manage share registrations, thanks to the new laws. ERC-884 aims to use it where each token will be designated as a share of a corporation formed in the state of Delaware.</div>
<p>ERC 884 additionally includes the following to comply with regulations:</p>
<div>There is no separate crowdsale contract to secure token owner whitelisting rather the ERC-884 requires whitelisting for all token owners. Although enabling crowdsale contracts can utilize the whitelist to verify eligibility, the whitelist is still an essential element of the token contract.</div>
<div>According to regulatory regulations, it must allow the corporation to create the shareholder list required by Sections 219 and 220 of The Act. Also, information recording is required by regulators and record share transfers.</div>
<div>Each ERC-884 coin must reflect a unique uncountable share that has been fully paid for. Data on partially paid shares does not need to be tracked. Likewise, an ERC-884 token does not need to be linked to a certain amount of shares. Knowing that a shareholder holds a certain amount of it is enough. Individually numbered shares are no longer essential in this circumstance.</div>
<div>A system must be implemented to enable shareholders who have misplaced their private key or lost access to their tokens to have their address revoked and their tokens re-issued to a new address.</div>
<div>The implementer should be able to extract the identity and physical address of any ETH address, hash that information, and match the generated hash to the hash contained in the contract using the hash function, therefore ensuring the cohesion of their data.</div>
<div>Because ERC-884 tokens are ERC-20 compatible, they may be exchanged on any cryptocurrency exchange that supports the trading of ERC-20 tokens, allowing the firm to avoid the use of a traditional mechanism.</div>

<file>erc-948.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>ERC-948 is a new Ethereum token protocol that is designed to connect subscription businesses with customers and allows for subscription-based transactions.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is ERC-948?</h2>
<div>ERC-948 is a new Ethereum token protocol designed exclusively for subscription-based transactions. Blockchain technology is transforming business models where the interaction of both doesn't seem to end anytime soon. This is where ERC-948 comes in. </div>
<div>As more organizations are integrating blockchain technology, blockchain engineers and enthusiasts aim to guarantee that it can be applied to subscription models. After establishing the economic motivation for subscription-capable coins and the lack of a protocol on which tokens can be created at the moment, ERC-948 can be a good opportunity for developers wishing to construct a platform on which businesses may rely on a proven, current economic model.</div>
<div>There is no scarcity of Ethereum-based token and digital asset standards. Users would be able to use the opt-out feature and more particularly, a smart contract can be written to withdraw tokens from users, provided that the users first ratify the contract. Such an idea may undoubtedly open up a plethora of new possible use cases for subscription-based systems.</div>
<p>Let’s look at how an opt-out protocol in ERC-928 works:</p>
<p>Economically, an opt-out strategy would be most effective since it would align customer and supplier incentives. The protocol may look something like this:</p>
<div>Using the Ethereum blockchain's smart contract power, an opt-out smart contract for a subscription service based on ERC-948 may look like this:</div>
<div>Despite several obstacles, ERC-948 offers a highly attractive and profitable environment for subscription service providers. Because blockchain technology is often quite adaptable, one does not need to be concerned about the issues provided because blockchain frequently discovers suitable answers.</div>
<div>If a uniform standard for subscriptions were developed, it may draw even more consumer-facing enterprises to blockchain technology. While much blockchain rhetoric demonizes the old and extols the new, we should keep an eye on the incentive structures that have proved effective in our existing economy, of which the subscription economy is unquestionably one.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A financial instrument where assets or cash are held by a third party while a buyer and a seller complete a deal.</preview>
<description>
<p>Escrow accounts come into play when there is uncertainty over whether one party or another will be able to meet the terms of a transaction. </p>
<p>These types of accounts have been used for many years in property transactions. Funds are held by a third party until the legal paperwork on a house has been completed, which then releases cash to the seller and the house to the buyer.</p>
<div>Escrow accounts are also used in banking, intellectual property, mergers and acquisitions, and, increasingly over the last decade, cryptocurrency transactions.</div>
<div>According to CipherTrace, $4.5 billion of cryptocurrency was lost through hacks and other scams — up from $1.7 billion in 2018.</div>
<p>Escrow can be useful when individuals want to trade assets from their digital wallets for cash, but are unsure whether the other party will back out once funds are sent.</p>
<div>Many escrow accounts can be automated using smart contracts on the blockchain, but they are often overseen by service companies.  </div>
<div>One of the blockchain's key benefits is the security of its distributed ledger. However, like any security system, it can be prone to hackers, human error and greedy investors who take on orders they cannot fulfil.</div>
<p>Escrow service companies are third parties who temporarily hold and regulate payment in a transaction, ensuring that the buyer and seller stick to the terms of their arrangement. </p>
<p>These firms charge a commission that ranges from 1% to 2%, which may be levied on the buyer, or seller, or both sides of the deal. </p>
<p>Some of these firms are governed by national regulators, and cash lodged with them may be covered by consumer compensation schemes, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the U.S.</p>
<p>Try to use a regulated firm when possible, because using an escrow service still means that, at some point, you will need to trust a third party with your funds. This means you may want a watchdog with teeth if things go wrong.</p>

<h2>What Is Esports?</h2>
<div>Esports has introduced the aspect of competitiveness in the world of gaming. Players from all over the world participate in esports gaming competitions and the winners walk away with millions. </div>
<div>Esports players are offered appealing possibilities for valuable corporate sponsorships because of their tremendous popularity; certain tournaments regularly draw more than a million viewers. Esports are competitive video games performed in a highly structured atmosphere. These games can vary from renowned multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs) for teams, to single-player first-person shooters, survival battle royales, and virtual recreations of physical sports.</div>
<div>Esports competitions and other events can draw audiences that equal those seen at most professional sporting events. The 2017 League of Legends World Championship attracted over 80 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched esports events of all time. ESPN and Disney XD announced in July that they had signed a multi-year contract to broadcast the Overwatch Competition, a brand-new worldwide league with 12 clubs based on the wildly popular multiplayer first-person game, Overwatch.</div>
<div>PUBG, which is an Esports multiplayer shooter game, had an event hosted in 2021 where the winning team Susquehanna Soniqs walked away with a prize of $1,296,189 in total winnings. </div>
<div>These prizes are common in the esports industry owing to its total valuation reaching $1,084.1 million dollars in 2021, which is a 50% increase from 2020.</div>
<div>Players in the esports industry, like conventional athletes, can earn millions of dollars in prize money from online and offline tournaments, which is usually shared between the players of the winning teams. That implies that the best players in the world may easily make seven figures in a year. Ticket sales for these contests help both teams and event organizers with generating huge revenues.</div>
<div>Furthermore, sponsorships, money for producing YouTube promotional videos, and even signing with gaming clubs are all possibilities for exceptional players in the e-sports world. Some popular examples include Tyler Blevins, commonly known as Ninja, a Fortnite prodigy, who is estimated to earn around $500,000 per month. Another player, Saahil &quot;Universe&quot; Arora, earns six figures from Dota 2 in every major event. However, only a small percentage of players qualify at that level. </div>
<div>The crypto world is also moving towards the e-sports gaming trend. Recently, CoinFund, blockchain research and advisory firm invested $2.3 million in an e-sports startup. Another popular example is Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange platform that announced its partnership with Berlin International Gaming (BIG) which implies that crypto experts see a huge potential in the e-sports sector and its transformation in the blockchain world. </div>
<div>With the rise of popular multiplayer games like Axie Infinity (AXS), CryptoBlades (SKILL), and many others, it is only a matter of time before blockchain gaming events will be held worldwide.</div>

<title>Ethash</title>

<file>ethash.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Ethash is the algorithm utilized for the proof of work mining Ethereum and ETH-based cryptocurrencies.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Ethash?</h2>
<div>Ethereum is an open technology platform on which developers create and deploy decentralized apps based on smart contract technology. Ethereum's native asset, Ether, is used to pay for transactions performed on the network. This cost is computed in gas but paid in Ether. It has a system in place to incentivize cryptocurrency miners to help safeguard the network. The Ethereum method for proof of work (PoW) mining, known as Ethash, serves as the foundation for the whole protocol. </div>
<div>When proof of work mining occurs, data from a block header is used as an input and is hashed repeatedly with a cryptographic hashing method. This yields a fixed-length output that reflects the hash value. Miners will hash variants of the input data by using a new sequence number each time the data is submitted into the process. </div>
<p>How Does It Work?</p>
<div>Ethash is a modified version that eliminates the computational cost that existed in its previous version, Dagger-Hashimoto. The program makes use of a vast dataset that is produced regularly and gradually expands over time. It is small enough to fit in the VRAM of a contemporary GPU.</div>
<div>With Ethash, the hash value produced by the process must be less than a given threshold. This is known as difficulty, and it entails the Ethereum network raising and lowering the threshold to manage the pace at which blocks are mined. If the rate at which blocks are found rises, the network automatically increases the difficulty level, lowering the network threshold so that the number of valid hashes capable of being found lowers as well.</div>
<p>If the pace of discovered blocks falls, the network threshold rises, resulting in a greater number of accurate hash values that can be found.</p>
<div>Ethash defines approximately how much computing resources should be expended by a miner to locate the sequence number (nonce) that permits them to propose a new block to add to the blockchain. The network generates one block every 12 seconds on average.</div>
<div>Miners frequently raise the memory clock frequency on their GPUs to obtain huge gains in Ethash hash rates. To counterbalance the related heat production, power or temperature constraints, as well as manually-set high fan speeds, are occasionally found.</div>
<div>To achieve the most cost-effective mining farms, it's usual to see custom-built PCs specified with six or more high-end GPUs for mining Ethereum, with little attention on the other components.</div>
<p>A miner that successfully discovers a block that may be added to the blockchain earns the following: </p>
<div>To summarize, Ethash is a memory-hard proof of work algorithm that has been intended to be ASIC-resistant in an attempt to make the mining process more equitable. It is also worth noting that there are proposals to change Ethereum's consensus mechanism from proof of work to proof of stake, which would render Ethereum mining useless in its present form. </div>

<h2>What Is Ether?</h2>
<p>Ether and Ethereum are both terms that tend to be used interchangeably. However, there are rather substantial differences between the two that need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>While Ethereum is the name of the blockchain platform, Ether refers to the cryptocurrency that runs on top of it — the world’s second-largest such asset.</p>
<p>Ether serves as the fuel that helps ensure that this network continues to run smoothly. It can be used as a medium of exchange — enabling crypto enthusiasts to buy and sell goods and services as they please. However, it’s also crucial for driving the development of decentralized applications that exist on the Ethereum network, too.</p>
<p>A range of transaction fees and computational services can be paid for using Ether. In the past, new coins have been created whenever miners verify a new block of transactions, but the Ethereum project has embarked on an ambitious move to a Proof-of-Stake protocol.</p>
<p>Ether is easy to find. It can be purchased on practically all major cryptocurrency exchanges. Also on the same blockchain, a number of tokens which have their own distinctive value have been created. These are normally referred to as ERC-20 tokens.</p>

<preview>Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)?</h2>
<p>Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) is a document used to describe standards for the Ethereum community. </p>
<div>These can be submitted to enforce change by any Ethereum community member and include client APIs, core protocol standards, code changes and contract standards.</div>
<p>There are a number of different types of EIPs. </p>
<p>The Standard Track: These are changes that impact all or most Ethereum implementations including changes to the network protocol. </p>
<p>Core: These changes require a consensus fork. They can often include discussions involving non-core development changes. </p>
<p>Networking: This includes improvements to network protocol specifications such as the devp2p (EIP8) and the Ethereum Subprotocol. </p>
<p>Interface: This includes improvements in client standards and specifications including API/RPC standards and specifications. </p>
<p>ERC: These refer to application-level standards and conventions and include name registries and token standards.</p>
<p>Meta: These processes change requests and operate similar to a Standard Track EIPs but apply to parts other than the Ethereum protocol. </p>
<p>Informational: This provides guidelines in designing Ethereum. Users and implementers can ignore informational EIPs as they don’t necessarily reflect an Ethereum community recommendation. </p>
<p>A number of other processes are involved to decide whether to include the changes once an EIP is submitted. </p>
<p>These include:</p>
<p>Draft: An EIP that is openly being considered. </p>
<p>Last Call: An EIP that has undergone initial consideration and is ready for review. </p>
<p>Final (Non-core): An EIP that is in last call for a minimum of two weeks and all technical concerns that have been raised have been dealt with. </p>
<p>Final (Core): An EIP that Core devs approve or intend to implement in future in hard fork. </p>
<p>Deferred: An EIP that will not be immediately adopted but is being considered for later adoption. </p>

<preview>Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) is the protocol to introduce new improvements to the network by developers.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Ethereum Request For Comment (ERC)?</h2>
<p>Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) standards are technical standards used for developing new Ethereum-based tokens.</p>
<div>Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) is similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP), in the sense that they are used to propose new protocol changes or standards to the network. ERCs are discussed within the Ethereum community on Github, then implemented and released if accepted by the core Ethereum developers and the broader community.</div>
<p>It is a protocol of rules that determine how data is formatted and transmitted. These rules also determine what actions will take place when a particular event happens. </p>
<div>New ERCs are created by submitting the proposal through EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal). EIP is a design document consisting of the information related to a new feature or its process – to provide information to the Ethereum community. It needs to provide complete technical specifications of the proposed feature along with the rationale for the feature. </div>
<p>Developers use Ethereum Improvement Proposal to submit new ERC policies. </p>
<p>After the submission, the community reviews these documents and gives its opinion, be it in favor or opposition. Once it has achieved approval from the community, developers implement the new ERC.</p>
<h2>ERC-20 Is the Most Popular Ethereum Request For Comment Standard</h2>
<div>ERC-20 is specific to the implementation of Ethereum tokens, giving developers the rules needed to create new tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem. ERC-20 was made popular by crowdfunding companies through ICO (initial coin offering).</div>
<div>The creators of ERC-20 are Vitalik Buterin and Fabian Vogelsteller. It was developed when developers needed a way of identifying tokens within smart contracts. The ERC-20 standard was created to ensure there was a common set of rules on the Ethereum blockchain to which all Ethereum tokens must adhere.</div>
<p>With the ERC-20 standard, developers can use one token as a building block in another smart contract without having to worry about compatibility issues or bugs. Prior to the creation of ERC-20, each token had its own purpose and function, which made it challenging for new projects to interact with other tokens on the Ethereum network.</p>
<h2>Another Popular ERC Standard Is ERC-721</h2>
<div>The ERC-721 standard allows for the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This means that each token is unique, unlike Ethereum's native currency Ether, or other fungible tokens. The standard allows developers to create a new type of digital assets, which can be used in applications such as crypto games.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Ethereum Transaction?</h2>
<p>Ethereum transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts, where an account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. The simplest transaction is the one that occurs from one ETH account to another.</p>
<div>In the world of cryptocurrencies, an Ethereum transaction is the action that is initiated by an externally-owned account, or in other words, one which is managed by a human, not a contract. If Johnny sends 2 ETH to Jim, Johnny's account has to be debited and Jim's has to be credited. When this state changes, the action takes place with a transaction.</div>
<p>Now, based on Ethereum's rules of consensus, the network agrees the transaction is a valid one, and then it gets included in a block that is added to the blockchain itself.</p>
<p>The message that makes up the transaction is an RLP-encoded array that has the ability to specify the details of the transaction itself and has values such as the recipient, the value, the data, the gas limit, the gas price, the nonce and the signature.</p>
<p>The recipient is the account address to which the transaction is actually sent.</p>
<p>The value is the amount of Ether to transfer from the sender to the recipient, and this can even be zero.</p>
<p>The data is an optional arbitrary binary data, where throughout the contract deployment, the contract's bytecode is sent.</p>
<p>The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by a transaction, while the gas price is the amount the sender will pay for each unit of gas. A nonce is a sequence number, which is per sender and has to match the next available sequence number. The signature is data that identifies as well as authenticates the transaction's sender.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?</h2>
<p>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a computation engine which acts like a decentralized computer that has millions of executable projects.</p>
<div>It acts as the virtual machine which is the bedrock of Ethereum’s entire operating structure. </div>
<p>It is considered to be the part of the Ethereum that runs execution and smart contract deployment.</p>
<p>The role of the EVM is to deploy a number of extra functionalities to the Blockchain to ensure users face limited issues on the distributed ledger. </p>
<p>Every Ethereum node runs on the EVM to maintain consensus across the blockchain.</p>
<p>Ethereum facilitates something called smart contracts, a piece of code that is running on Ethereum. </p>
<p>EVM is completely isolated meaning the code inside the EVM has no access to network, file system or other processes. </p>
<p>Ethereum has two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts, both of which are treated equally under the EVM. </p>
<p>Account abstraction tries to reduce this to just one account meaning both EOAs and Contract Accounts function like each other. </p>
<p>EOAs are controlled by private keys, meanwhile contract accounts are stored in the smart contracts, also known as smart wallets. </p>
<p>A contract which is written in the smart-contract coding is converted into something called a bytecode. </p>
<div>Most of the source code for using smart contracts is done using programming language from Solidity. </div>
<p>It is then converted into opcodes for the EVM to interpret. </p>
<p>The EVM then uses the operation codes in order to complete certain tasks. </p>
<div>So, the EVM works like a large decentralized or master computer to complete all types of tasks on the blockchain. </div>
<div>EVM is one of the biggest projects in the world of cryptocurrencies.</div>

<preview>When a transaction is mined, smart contracts can emit events and write logs to the blockchain which the frontend can then process.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Event Triggers?</h2>
<div>Events are critical on any blockchain as they facilitate communication between smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programs with the terms of the buyer’s and seller’s agreement directly embedded into lines of code for response with user interfaces. When a transaction is mined, smart contracts can emit events and write logs to the blockchain which the frontend can then process. </div>
<div>In standard circumstances when a user wants to call a smart contract, they need to manually sign a transaction and interact with the blockchain. This is where automation can come into play to simplify things for users.
Event-driven automation uses specific triggers to kick-off processes without manual intervention. Once an event is identified, an automation tool can then trigger a predefined process or workflow of smart contracts.
This can be extremely beneficial for users in streamlining experience, such as:
1. For blockchains like Ethereum which are notorious for high gas fees and slowed transaction speeds; when the network is clogged from high usage, a trigger can be set for automated notifications to users when the threshold for fees are reached, saving time. </div>
<p>2. For trading, notification triggers can be set when respective token prices reach a designated level, making the action of taking profits or mitigating losses fuss-free.</p>

<h2>What Is an Exchange?</h2>
<div>A cryptocurrency exchange is a digital marketplace which enables buyers and sellers to trade cryptocurrencies or other digital assets for fiat money or other cryptocurrencies. </div>
<p>The exchange plays the role of an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. </p>
<p>Exchanges operate like a brokerage and accept payment through card or other forms of electronic payment in exchange for cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>The cryptocurrency exchange often levies a fee for this process. </p>
<p>Exchanges are able to send the digital assets to a consumer’s personal wallet. Other digital currencies are backed by other commodities, such as precious metals, including gold. </p>
<p>There are two types of cryptocurrency exchanges: decentralized and centralized. </p>
<p>A centralized exchange, which is the most common way to trade cryptocurrencies, involves the exchange acting as the middleman to facilitate the transactions between the parties. </p>
<div>Decentralized exchanges (DEX) enable peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading and are operated without a central authority. </div>
<div>Examples of decentralized exchanges include IDEX and Curve Finance. </div>
<p>Digital currency exchanges have been some of the biggest winners of the surge in cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Some of the biggest centralized exchanges include Binance, Coinbase and Kraken.</p>
<p>The more volume there is on an exchange, the lower volatility levels will be. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)?</h2>
<div>Short for Exchange Traded Fund, an ETF is a basket of securities that includes assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities and cryptocurrencies, but trades as a single stock on an exchange. </div>
<p>ETFs share many similarities with mutual funds, as both provide a way for investors to diversify returns and usually include a combination of asset classes. </p>
<p>In contrast, mutual funds can only be bought and sold once in a day, after the market has closed. </p>
<p>The price of an ETF will usually fluctuate throughout the day as it is sold. </p>
<p>ETFs are commonly used by investors to diversify portfolios as they are often invested in more than one sector. </p>
<p>Though an ETF can also be invested in just a single sector. </p>
<p>ETFs typically track the performance of a single market index such as the S&amp;P 500 Index, or the FTSE 100. </p>
<p>Some of the most popular ETFs include the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). This ETF tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. </p>
<p>iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) tracks the Russell 2000 small-cap index. </p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of ETFs is usually the low cost associated with them, particularly if an ETF is passively managed, where it tracks the performance of an index. </p>
<p>ETFs can also be actively managed, which means a portfolio manager will manage the ETF and make investment decisions not necessarily designed to mirror the performance of the underlying index. </p>
<p>ETFs have two key tax advantages compared to mutual funds. The capital gains tax on the ETF is incurred only when the ETF is sold. But mutual funds carry capital gain tax changes throughout the investment horizon. </p>
<p>ETF investors can also participate in short selling which involves selling a stock that is currently not owned by the investor and bought back at a later date when the price of the security in question falls. </p>

<title>Exit Scam</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/exit-scam</url>
<file>exit-scam.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An exit scam is a trick where projects disappear (or shut down) after accumulating investors’ money.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is An Exit Scam?</h2>
<div>An exit scam refers to an event where a cryptocurrency project disappears with investors' money during or after the ICO period. In other words, whales try to pump the price alongside advertising and promotional activities, only to dump their coins later. It is quite difficult to spot such events until they happen, much like a black swan event, however, these occur more often than the latter one. </div>
<h2>What Is a Crypto Exit Strategy?</h2>
<p>The exit scam strategy is simple: a project launches a cryptocurrency platform using a promising concept, raises funds from investors, runs for a brief period of time, and then disappears, leaving investors in a predicament.</p>
<h2>The Rich History of Exist Scams in the Crypto Industry</h2>
<div>In recent times, a number of projects moved towards the rug pull strategy (another form of exit scam). Even some of the most popular ones trusted by famous public figures have fallen under this category. One example is the recent TITAN project from Iron Finance, which gained popularity mainly due to the investment made by Mark Cuban.</div>
<div>Another popular example is the recent sale of Logan Paul's NFTs, where three holders of 3,000 NFT which were to be sold had a chance to win a Pokemon First Edition bundle valued at $40,000. The NFTs initially received a lot of attention which shot their worth above $20,000. However, at this point, most of these are left on OpenSea at a price of around $1,000.</div>
<h2>What Is the BitConnect Exit Scam?</h2>
<div>On January 16, 2018, Bitconnect announced that it was shutting down its currency exchange and loan operations after regulators from Texas and North Carolina issued a cease-and-forth order. After the closing of operations, the platform that was running a Ponzi scheme refunded users in the form of BCC (native token) that went from its all-time high of around $465 to below $1 within a week. </div>
<h2>How to Protect Yourself From Exit Scams?</h2>
<div>Before you get excited and buy tokens promoted by your favorite YouTuber (usually at a price that has already gone up), be sure to check out the basics of the project. Often, a project is simply a cheap &quot;copy&quot; of an existing solution without solid foundations for its future growth. Do research when it comes to projects that offer high returns.  Also, be sure to use price tracking platforms like CoinMarketCap regularly to get the latest information and building materials when it comes to crypto tokens.</div>

<title>Falling Knife</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/falling-knife</url>
<file>falling-knife.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A falling knife refers to the price dive of an asset and denotes a downward momentum of the financial market.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Falling Knife?</h2>
<div>When the price of an asset decreases rapidly, it is referred to as a falling knife. When it happens, experienced traders hold off on purchasing back into the asset until it reaches its lowest point. This is because many assets rebound swiftly after the falling knife reaches its bottom, also known as a whipsaw.</div>
<div>For a variety of reasons, a stock's downward price behavior qualifies it as a falling knife. Negative news regarding an issuing business may often result in an asset’s falling knife pattern, which is followed by broad market divestment. In these situations, the stock's price frequently recovers in the market when the issuer makes a good follow-up statement.</div>
<div>If timed correctly, a falling knife can produce huge profits for many investors. If investors do not buy the stock according to the trend, they risk losing money if the price keeps falling, until a whipsaw happens, causing prices to rise beyond the investors' initial position.</div>
<div>To intercept a falling knife without incurring losses, you'll need luck, bravery, and market knowledge. Freefall methods are not suggested for individuals with small investments or portfolio that is not well-diversified. The risk and rewards involved, though, make this an appealing approach for investors who regard the market as a game as well as a profit opportunity.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As shown above, Bitcoin (BTC) created a falling knife which indicates a bad time to enter the market, especially for bulls. It completed its downtrend and rebounded after some good horizontal moves on the daily chart. Investors who timed this falling knife correctly entered the market with a short position and got out once the falling knife touched its bottom point.</div>
<div>New investors, according to experts, are more inclined to try to grab a falling knife since it enables them to acquire it at a cheap price. Investors who pursue a long-term strategy, on the other hand, may be put off by it since they believe a falling stock will eventually recover. In the long term, catching a falling knife can pay off, but it's a calculated gamble. A proportion of your investment portfolio can be utilized for this sort of investment if you have a huge portfolio, but having a substantial percentage invested in these types of assets is extremely hazardous.</div>
<div>The secret to catching a falling knife is to expect to make a mistake. Rather than reinforcing your error by purchasing more, it is critical to limit your exposure and reclaim your emotional equilibrium. To begin, you must have a strong belief in your purchasing analysis, since if you are incorrect in this area, it will not matter how wonderful your timing is. Nevertheless, even if you are correct and confident, poor timing may be catastrophic for your portfolio.</div>
<div>The causes behind a falling knife can be many. Some of them include economic reports, equity offerings to the public, support &amp; resistance levels, bad news about the company, and many others. Due to this wide speculation and uncertainty, most often it is the insider information and not the technical indicators that come in handy before a falling knife occurs.</div>

<title>Falling Wedge</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/falling-wedge</url>
<file>falling-wedge.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Falling wedges, also known as descending wedges, have a distinct downward slope and a bullish bias in comparison to symmetrical triangles, which have no discernible slope and no bias.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Falling Wedge?</h2>
<div>The falling wedge pattern is an important trend that indicates a future upward trend. It is wide at the top and becomes narrower as the price falls. As the reaction highs and lows converge, the price action forms a cone that slopes downward.  </div>
<div>When a market centralizes between two intersecting support and resistance lines, a falling wedge pattern forms. When the support and resistance lines point downwards, this is also an indication of a falling wedge. The slope of the resistance line must be greater than that of the support line.</div>
<div>The following are the key characteristics of the falling wedge:</div>
<div>It can be interpreted as a continuation or reversal formation on the trendline, depending on its location on the price chart. Both scenarios involve different market conditions that must be taken into account.</div>
<div>To distinguish continuation and reversal patterns on the trendline, look for the appearance of the falling wedge. If it appears in an uptrend, it is a continuation pattern; if it appears in a downtrend, it is a reversal pattern.</div>
<div>It denotes the end of the consolidation period. As a result, the falling wedge can be thought of like the silence before the storm. It signals buyers to regroup and attract new buying interests, which will be used to defeat the bears and push the price action higher.</div>
<div>Therefore, a falling wedge is an important technical formation indicating that the adjustment, or consolidation, has just been completed as the asset's price has left the wedge to the upside and, generally, the overall trend is continuing.</div>
<h2>How Do You Spot a Falling Wedge?</h2>
<div>The first step is to determine whether there exists an uptrend or a downtrend. Then, with the help of a trend line, connect the lower highs and lower lows. The lines will show convergence and slope in the downward direction. One has to identify the divergence between the price and an oscillator. Additional technical tools will come in handy in confirming the oversold signal. Finally, identify the break above the resistance point, this is an indicator for entry into the market.</div>
<div>Not all wedges will result in a breakout.  Waiting for the breakout to start is one way of verifying the move. Essentially, you're hoping for a drastic shift beyond the support trend line for a rising wedge or the resistance trend line for a falling wedge.</div>
<div>For ascending wedges, for example, traders will be most concerned with a move above a previous support level. On the flip side, keep in mind that the general rule that during a breakout support can turn into resistance and can be applied. Therefore, you can wait for a breakout to begin, then wait for it to return and bounce off the ascending wedge's previous support area. This will allow you to confirm the move before opening your position.</div>
<div>Falling volume as the market consolidates is another common indicator of a wedge nearing a breakout. A surge in volume following a breakout is a good indicator that a larger move is on the way.</div>

<title>Fan Token</title>

<file>fan-token.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A fan token is a cryptocurrency issued by a specific sports team and allows its holders to participate in the governing activities and attain exclusive rewards &amp; discounts.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Fan Token?</h2>
<div>Fan tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that entitles users to a range of fan-related membership benefits in a football club. It can include discounts, prizes, voting rights on kit designs &amp; club decisions, and participation in one-of-a-kind experiences offered by the sports team.</div>
<div>Chiliz mobile application, Socios, can be termed as the pioneer of creating fan tokens that allow Socios users to vote on ideas concerning specific sports teams, such as uniform design modifications, team matches, and more. Smart contracts that run on the Chiliz blockchain allow Socios users to vote on the clubs’ decisions. To get fan tokens, users must first buy Chiliz (CHZ), which can then be traded on different exchanges.</div>
<div>Fan tokens are used by sports teams to allow fans to unlock VIP benefits, such as meet &amp; greets with their favorite players and premium box seats during a game. The more fan tokens you have, the more possibilities you have of receiving unique prizes and voting power for your favorite team.</div>
<div>Through a mobile voting platform, shareholdings of fan tokens allow fans to engage in fan-led choices while also acting as a ticket into a secure, privileged inner circle of fans who share similar passions and views. The more tokens a fan has and the more votes they cast, the higher their clout rating gets, pushing them up through the reward tiers until they have access to the most exclusive VIP privileges available.</div>
<div>Most fan tokens are available on Socios.com, however, some, like Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token (PSG), can also be found on well-known centralized exchanges (CEX), but others may not be certified or substantial enough to be listed. </div>
<div>Fan token values, like the value of many other cryptocurrencies, can rise and fall in response to supply and demand. Some football fans who own these tokens have also stated that the prices are affected by the team's movements or activity. New player signings, managerial changes, and league performance are all examples of this.</div>
<div>A great example of this is the PSG token, which experienced a price gain of 300%+ in a matter of days, as one of the greatest football players in the world, Lionel Messi, made a transfer from the Spanish club, Barcelona, to the French club, PSG. The price of the PSG token fell down after the transfer was complete, however, it skyrocketed again a few days later. This is a clear indication that the price of a fan token depends on ‘major’ activity in the club. Winning or losing a match, major player transfer, or any other BIG news can increase or decrease the price of a fan token easily.</div>
<div>While making any investment, it's always a good idea to consider the product's worth and potential solutions. Fan tokens' utility is limited to the particular perks that sports teams offer.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers to regulate information sharing for certain large transactions.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the FATF Travel Rule?</h2>
<div>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) travel rule refers to a regulatory guidance update to its Recommendation 16  that was implemented in 2019 as part of the FATF Standards to combat cases of crypto money laundering and terrorism funding (AML/CFT).  The FATF Travel Rule, derived from the United States’ Banking Secrecy Act (BSA),  mandates that countries ensure that their domestically operating virtual asset service providers (VASPs), such as crypto exchanges and custodial platforms, implement the necessary tools to facilitate personal information sharing with transaction counterparty VASPs at the time of a transmittal for transactions exceeding 1,000 USD. </div>
<p>This is to allow government agencies the ability to collect data from any user who conducts financial transactions valued above 1,000 USD. Some of the collected information includes a user’s name, account number, and the details of the accounts they send their money to. Additional requirements cover the need for proof of address, identity, and date and place of birth, among others.</p>
<div>Under the same rule, VASPs and other financial institutions are obligated to share information with each other, especially in transactions that are covered by its threshold. They are also primarily responsible for ensuring that any information sent out to other participants is accurate and updated. This regulation defines any financial institution or cryptocurrency company as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP).</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Faucet?</h2>
<div>Faucet is a cryptocurrency award system which rewards cryptocurrency holders in order for completing certain tasks on a website. </div>
<p>It is considered an effortless way to earn crypto assets which doesn’t require any expertise unlike cryptocurrency trading. </p>
<p>The tasks can involve viewing ads or completing captcha tasks. </p>
<p>The reward system was designed to incentivize purchases of cryptocurrencies, particularly altcoins, which are alternative digital currencies to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>After cryptocurrency prices rose in 2019, payouts from faucets have become increasingly low.</p>
<p>Faucets usually require a user to complete a captcha in order to qualify for the small portion of coins. </p>
<div>Bitcoin faucets are unsurprisingly one of the most popular forms of faucets.</div>
<p>Developed in 2010 by Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin faucet was the first to be developed. </p>
<p>In the early days, Bitcoin faucets used to be worth five whole BTC. </p>
<p>Faucets tied to the likes of Ethereum, Dogecoin and Litecoin later emerged.</p>
<p>In the case of BTC, the faucet is rewarded in the form of a satoshi, which is the hundredth of a millionth of a Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Satoshi was named after Bitcoin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. </p>
<p>Most faucet rewards are paid directly to a user’s wallet or whichever third-party wallet is being used. </p>
<p>Faucets should not be mistaken with airdrops and bounties, which are also other ways of achieving cryptocurrency awards. </p>
<p>Airdrops are usually distributed by cryptocurrency start-ups and give a one-time reward for helping a firm with community building. </p>

<title>Fee Tiers</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fee-tiers</url>
<file>fee-tiers.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Fee tiers refer to the fee structure that determines the amount charged when investors deposit or withdraw money and execute trades on a crypto exchange.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Fee Tiers?</h2>
<p>Fee tiers refer to the fee structure that determines the amount charged when investors deposit or withdraw money and execute trades on a crypto exchange. Each exchange has its own fee structure that often differs depending on volume and types of trades. </p>
<p>Some crypto exchanges provide a variety of ways to deposit fiat money ranging from bank and PayPal transfers to credit and debit card usage, which may incur fees ranging between 2% to 5%.</p>
<p>Trading fees are packaged in many forms depending on the amount spent, and whether the swap, convert, or trading tool function is being used. While a number of exchanges offer swap or convert options that are more convenient for new traders, these are often the most expensive ones. It is thus important to review and calculate the charges so the fees can be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>Trading fees are often charged in the form of a flat fee which increases or decreases when the value of the trade is below or above a specific level (for example, a fee of $0.99 is charged for trades below $10, and more for higher trades), or a percentage fee using a “maker-taker” model.  </p>
<p>In the “maker-taker" model, the fees are often a percentage of the total trade, and it is </p>
<div>important to note that users are charged when the trade is executed and matched, and not when the trade order is created. For some exchanges, these fees can be reduced by paying with the platform's utility token and often translates to lower percentage rates being charged with higher trading volume and frequency beyond a specified level. Platforms may also offer VIP tiers with exclusive incentives and benefits, like discounted rates.</div>
<div>A trade order will incur a maker fee if it is not matched immediately with a buyer or seller's order on the order book. These trades will instead be added to the order book, adding liquidity. An example would be limit orders (which indicate the maximum and minimum price a trader is willing to buy or sell at) that do not get fulfilled immediately. </div>
<p>For taker fees, they are incurred if the trade is matched immediately with an order on the order book. An example would be market orders (when a trader places an order at market price for cryptocurrencies and other assets on the exchange) that are usually completely fulfilled.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are also withdrawal fees that can be charged for users when withdrawing their assets and converting them into fiat money into their bank accounts, or shifting their cryptocurrencies from one platform to another, which vary from fixed amounts to percentages.</p>
<p>This encourages traders and users to make more calculated and less impulsive decisions, minimizing the likelihood of the exchange being flooded with excessive or piecemeal trade requests, and also providing revenue and funds for the platform or exchange.  </p>
<div>The fees collected often go into the growth and development of the exchange platforms, and in the context of decentralized exchanges, to liquidity providers and investors of the platform via yield farming and liquidity mining programs.</div>

<description>
<h2>What is Fiat Currency?</h2>
<p>If you are getting started in the world of crypto, you may hear the term “fiat” thrown around quite often. The definition of fiat money or fiat currency is money a government has deemed or certified as legal tender that they support. The dictionary definition of “fiat” is simply an authoritative or arbitrary order. So, the government issues an order dictating that USD, GBP, INR, EUR, or other world currency is lawful and accepted to pay both public and private debts. </p>
<div>Fiat money is issued by governments’ reserves, treasury and central bank systems to be released into circulation. Fiat money is not backed by gold or silver, but is backed by the governments that mint and distribute the currency. This can be dangerous as countries have a tendency to print too much money to stimulate their economies, resulting in inflation. Fiat currency gives governments the power to implement policies meant to control things like supply, liquidity and interest rates.</div>
<p>There are types of fiat money supply that are denoted as “M’s” in economics. There are four classifications of money supply below from most liquid to least liquid: </p>
<p>Unlike fiat currency, cryptocurrency is decentralized. This means that no monetary authority or country has approved of or has a say in the distribution or use of the currency. Cryptocurrency has no physical bills or coins but is instead completely digital. Cryptocurrency is not legal tender (in all countries except for El Salvador at time of writing) and cannot be used in many places as a means of payment. </p>
<p>The main differences between fiat currency and cryptocurrency are compared here: </p>
<div>In many places around the world, cashless transactions have become the new normal. Digital fiat has become the main way many people do business. Many governments are now considering releasing a totally digital currency that is possibly blockchain-based. These are known as central bank digital currencies or CBDCs. These currencies were inspired by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, but are very different because they are centralized and their value is still controlled by the government’s monetary policy. </div>
<p>Cryptocurrency can replace fiat currency in all its uses. Crypto can be used as a store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. Crypto and decentralized finance remove the need for expensive and inefficient intermediaries such as banks. Additionally the value of a cryptocurrency isn’t determined by a government as is the case with fiat. It replaces antiquated record keeping with an immutable and trustless ledger that every user has access to. </p>
<p>However, many cryptocurrencies have issues with things like transaction speed and high energy usage. The new technology is advancing quickly to cover these problems to create a system of finance that is better than fiat in every way. </p>

<file>fiat-on-ramp.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A fiat-on ramp is a way to get cryptocurrency from fiat, or regular money.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Fiat On-Ramp?</h2>
<div>On-ramp refers to an exchange or another type of service where you have the ability to offer fiat money in exchange for cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>An on-ramp essentially allows you to convert fiat money into cryptocurrencies. These platforms are typically known as exchanges, where they base the amount for the fiat-crypto transaction on the current market rates.</p>
<p>In fact, there are three ways through which you can get cryptocurrencies as well as other blockchain assets.</p>
<p>First, you can mine them, and this means that you can offer your computing power to a blockchain network in return for coins or tokens. Another way is to sell goods as well as services and accept cryptocurrencies as a way of compensation for your efforts or products.</p>
<p>However, these options might not be available for just about anyone, and this is where the third way, the fiat on-ramp, will allow you to buy cryptocurrency by simply using cash. All you have to do is visit an online exchange or physical crypto ATM, and take your fiat currency and exchange it for an equivalent amount of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The main reason they are called on-ramps is due to the fact that they provide you with access to the entirety of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. </p>
<p>Then you have cryptocurrency off-ramps, which are the opposite of on-ramps. They allow you to convert your cryptocurrency into fiat currency, although you can also get products or services.</p>
<p>In the previous on-ramp scenario, you were a user that needed to get into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but what if you wanted to get out of it? This is where off-ramps come into the picture. You can trade back into fiat through them, due to the fact that fiat currencies, in a lot of parts of the world, are still the primary means of conducting purchases or payments and so on.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Fiat-Pegged Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<div>Also known as “pegged cryptocurrency,” it is a coin, token or asset issued on a blockchain that is linked to a government or bank-issued currency. </div>
<div>Each pegged cryptocurrency is designed to always have a specific cash value in reserves.</div>
<div>Fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies are considered to be examples of stablecoins.</div>
<div>They were created to tackle extreme levels of volatility.</div>
<p>Cryptocurrencies can typically be very volatile.</p>
<p>Huge upward and downward swings are very common. </p>
<p>Stablecoins are usually pegged to key currencies such as the euro, the British pound or the U.S. dollar. </p>
<p>While it is very much possible for fiat currencies to depreciate against other currencies, massive swings in currencies are less likely. </p>
<p>Stablecoins can vary in structure. </p>
<p>Some fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies have a strict structure. This means they can only be issued if a unit of a fiat money is deposited. </p>
<div>Tether is one of the most renowned examples of fiat-backed cryptocurrencies. </div>
<p>It has been a very controversial cryptocurrency as Tether has previously claimed that each unit was backed by the U.S. dollar. </p>
<p>But in March 2019, Tether’s cryptocurrency expanded its backing to include loans to affiliate companies, which are considered less stable than fiat-backed currencies. </p>
<div>Cryptocurrency exchanges are considered the biggest holders of fiat-backed cryptocurrencies. </div>
<p>The best cryptocurrency exchanges are often required to protect positions from price volatility by holding some reserves in the fiat-backed asset. </p>
<p>This is cited as a key reason why exchanges are big holders of fiat-backed cryptos. </p>
<p>Boosting the exchange’s liquidity base is considered another big driver for exchanges to hold fiat-backed cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>It is not always the case that all crypto exchanges have access to banking services. Holding some fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies can act as a hedge for this. </p>

<title>Fibonacci Retracement Level</title>

<file>fibonacci-retracement.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The Fibonacci retracement method uses a set of key numbers called Fibonacci ratios to identify the support and resistance levels of an asset/stock/cryptocurrency.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Fibonacci Retracement Level?</h2>
<div>Developed by Leonardo Fibonacci in 1170 AD, Fibonacci ratios represent a set of key numbers (Fibonacci retracement levels) created by considering two extreme points of the ratios. These include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%.</div>
<div>Horizontal lines are drawn that represent Fibonacci retracement levels that represent support and resistance levels. Each level corresponds to a certain ratio or percentage. It illustrates how far the price has tried to reverse from a previous movement. The prior trend is anticipated to continue in the same way. Yet, before that occurs, the asset's price normally retraces to one of the above-mentioned ratios.</div>
<h2>How to Use Fibonnaci Retracement?</h2>
<div>The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that includes a certain pattern like, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc. Every number in this sequence is the sum of its previous two numbers and every number is 1.618 times greater than the previous number. The Fibonacci ratios are calculated simply by dividing the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. For example, the ratio of 61.8% is calculated by dividing 21 by 34 or dividing 55 by 89. The same goes for every other Fibonacci ratio as well.</div>
<div>Fibonacci ratios identify the price momentum of an asset in the financial markets. Technical traders use them to draw support lines, visualize resistance levels, safeguard their capital by putting stop-losses at key Fib levels and set take-profit targets.</div>
<h2>How to Draw Fibonacci Retracement?</h2>
<div>Most traders use Fibonacci retracements on a 1D chart to identify the long-term trend of an asset. Another important thing that Fibonacci retracements tell a trader is to include resistance levels, support lines, stop-loss targets, and entry levels.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the chart above, you can see that the Fibonacci retracement is drawn from the lowest point on the 1-day chart of Bitcoin (BTC) to its highest point. The Fibonacci ratios can be seen on the left-hand side along with support lines. Notice how BTC broke the 0.65 ratios, also called the 'golden pocket', and sprung up to the 0.382 level. When it broke that level, 0.382 became its support and it consolidated for a few days before breaking the 0.236 lines on the Fibonacci retracement chart. </div>
<h2>What Is the Best Setting for Fibonacci Ratios?</h2>
<div>Different traders use different ratios; however, the most common Fibonacci ratios include 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. </div>
<div>Like every other technical indicator, Fibonacci retracements also have some flaws and you should be aware of them before using this indicator to invest your capital in the financial markets. The first disadvantage is that this indicator isn't objective, which means that it works well only for some assets. For Fibonacci retracement to work in the market's favor, a significant amount of traders have to use the same Fib ratios, which will then reflect in the price momentum of the asset as well. Since there is no logical proof behind this technical indicator, using it solely makes it unreliable and it is advised to use other technical indicators like relative strength index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), on-balance volume (OBV indicator), Aroon indicator, and the stochastic oscillator. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)?</h2>
<p>Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA is an integrated circuit that allows customers or designers to reconfigure as per requirement after the manufacturing process. This customization usually involves selecting and placing a set of gates, switches, and routing channels. The programming varies depending on the needs and goals. However, it can be a single, simple logic gate or may involve multiple complex functions.  </p>
<p>Users program it directly with a programming language such as Verilog or VHDL, in order to create custom hardware functions that are specific to their needs.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that FPGA isn't actually a new technology, but rather a combination of existing technologies which has been around for over 40 years. If you've ever played around with an Arduino board, you'll have some experience with FPGA technology.</p>
<p>The FPGA configuration can be performed remotely, typically after it is installed in the end application. </p>
<p>Because it’s programmable, it makes it possible to use the same piece of hardware for a variety of different applications. It also makes the device usable for prototyping new designs with a little upfront cost.</p>
<h2>Where Is It Used?</h2>
<div>It is a form of programmable logic that merges the flexibility of software with the hardware performance of an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC.</div>
<p>The result is an extremely high-performance chip that can be tailored to specific uses. FPGAs find their primary application in high-performance computing such as telecommunications, military, aerospace, and finance. The technology is also used for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of an FPGA over a general-purpose processor is that it can be more efficient in terms of power usage, size, and speed. Each of these factors becomes more important as the number of computations increases. An FPGA is far more flexible than a hard-wired ASIC implementation, making it possible to change the hardware implementation without changing the software that runs on it.</p>
<p>FPGAs are used in applications from cryptocurrency mining to audio processing. FPGAs provide a flexible alternative to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are chips designed for a particular purpose and can't be repurposed.</p>
<p>In the past, FPGAs were quite expensive for most companies. But recent developments have made them more affordable for many businesses, which has spawned excitement among entrepreneurs and engineers.</p>
<p>FPGAs can be programmed to be completely different applications. You could use a certain platform for one job today and something completely different tomorrow — all without having to start over from scratch.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)?</h2>
<div>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), also known by its French name, Group d’action financière (GAFI) is a global organization that sets global standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT). The FATF was formed in 1989 by the G7. At the time of its inception, it had 16 members, but as of 2021, it has 39. In 2001, the FATF’s mandate was expanded to include terrorist financing following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</div>
<p>The force is tasked with learning money laundering trends, monitoring legislative, financial, and law enforcement activities at both national and international levels, as well as reporting on compliance and issuing recommendations and standards to combat money laundering. </p>
<div>The Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and Nine Special Recommendations on Terror Financing of the FATF set the global standard for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing on an individual level to allow each member state to implement them according to their own circumstances and constitutional framework. </div>
<div>In addition to the legally non-binding 40+9 Recommendations, FATF began issuing its FATF Black List in 2010, officially called the list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCT). The list includes jurisdictions that were uncooperative in international money laundering and terrorist financing efforts. </div>
<p>This includes unwillingness to provide bank or brokerage account records, customer identification, and beneficial ownership information relating to these accounts, shell companies, and other financial entities commonly used to launder money. </p>
<div>In June 2019 FATF updated its Standards with its guidance “A Risk-based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)”, which includes its so-called FATF Travel Rule obligating exchanges to share compliant user information with each other. The FATF will convene in late June 2021 and once again update its recommendations on crypto assets.</div>

<div>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a federal regulatory bureau of the United States Treasury. FinCEN is the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and is one of more than 100 international FIUs which make up the Egmont Group, an entity that is focused on cooperation and information sharing among FIUs. As an FIU, FinCEN is required to disclose financial information concerning suspected proceeds of crime and potential terrorist financing. </div>
<p>The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) collects and analyzes information about financial transactions to combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. </p>
<p>It was established in 1990 by the US Department of the Treasury. FinCEN's mission is to enhance U.S. national security, deter and detect criminal activity, and safeguard financial systems from abuse by promoting transparency in the U.S. and international financial systems.</p>
<p>Its mission is to safeguard the U.S. financial system from money laundering. It is tasked with the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial transaction data for law enforcement purposes as well as building global cooperation with counterpart organizations in other countries and with international bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). </p>
<div>FinCEN carries out its regulatory duties under the Currency and Financial Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, which legislative framework is commonly referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The BSA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue financial regulations to banks and other financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering (AML) programs and file reports to aid in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings, as well as certain intelligence and counter-terrorism matters. </div>

<preview>First in, First Out (FIFO) is an inventory method used to specify your cost-basis when calculating your taxes.</preview>
<description>
<p>“First in, First Out (FIFO) is an inventory method used to specify your cost-basis when calculating your taxes. It is available in many tax jurisdictions throughout the world, and is approved by the IRS. In cryptocurrency, the FIFO method considers that the first coins you purchased are also the first coins you sold when calculating the cost of goods sold (COGS) and associated taxes on profits.”</p>
<h2>What Is First In, First Out?</h2>
<div>First In, First Out (FIFO) is an inventory method that the IRS recommends using if U.S. taxpayers can’t specifically identify a cryptocurrency’s unit due to missing or unavailable information, otherwise known as the Specific Identification Method (see IRS Notice 24).</div>
<p>Every time you receive or dispose of a cryptocurrency, you may be liable for both capital gains and income tax based on the type of transaction. If you have made a profitable trade buying and selling crypto, or you are receiving interest from your crypto holdings, you will need to pay taxes.</p>
<div>Using the FIFO method, your assets are calculated as being sold in the same chronological order as you bought them. In its latest cryptocurrency tax guidance report, Rev. Rul. 2019-24, the IRS has classified the First In, First Out (FIFO) and Specific Identification as the recommended methods to calculate cost basis.</div>
<p>Keep in mind that the IRS determines the amount of tax you’ll pay based on how long you held the cryptocurrency before selling. There can be long-term capital gain discounts on assets held greater than one year. If you need to file your crypto earnings and don’t meet the Specific ID rules, choose FIFO, given it is the most commonly used inventory method and reflects a conservative accounting process.</p>
<p>As per the IRS, you need to calculate the capital gains for each transaction (buying, selling, trading) using cryptocurrency by employing the standard methodology of deducting the cost-basis from the proceeds.</p>
<p>In this case, the proceeds refers to the amount you received, and the cost-basis refers to the amount you paid to acquire the cryptocurrency. If this was a crypto-crypto transaction, you will have to determine the values in USD. In the case that there were fees associated with the trade, you can also add this to your cost basis.</p>
<p>For example, you purchased one coin in 2015 for $1,000, another in 2017 for $2,000 and sold one in 2020 for $3,000. When you calculate your capital gains using the FIFO method, you will sell the first coin in your “inventory” from 2015, and your gain would be $2,000 ($3,000-$1,000).</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a First-Mover Advantage (FMA)?</h2>
<div>First-Mover Advantage (FMA) refers to a company/organization that launches a breakthrough product or service in the market to gain an advantage over other contenders. The competitive advantage that comes from being the first to enter the market arena and create brand recognition and customer loyalty even before your competitors are in the field is what the first mover is all about. They typically receive brand leadership and loyalty, but they must continue to adapt in order to avoid being eclipsed by competitors.</div>
<div>The crypto-space remains a hub of creativity and technological progress. It is a significant benefit in the blockchain sector since blockchain projects or crypto exchanges have a limited market and clients. Making their first move in the market is their best hope since their success is heavily reliant on their reputation and recognition.</div>
<div>Switching from one cryptocurrency network to another incurs transaction charges as well as potential risks. This might be one of the many reasons why consumers are hesitant to migrate from their existing exchange to a newly established one, even if the services provided are effective and efficient. Significant effort and time are required by subsequent entrants to persuade the existing customers to switch from one crypto exchange to another.</div>
<div>One of the three primary methods is to get a technological advantage over competitors. First movers have more time than later entrants to gather and develop technical expertise since they start earlier. The second method is to prevent subsequent comers from gaining access to rare assets, such as building rare digital assets when it comes to blockchain, hiring efficient staff, or getting critical suppliers. The third method is to establish an early client base that would find it cumbersome or costly to convert to the services of later competitors.</div>
<div>Establishing your product as the industry standard, such as in the realm of cryptocurrencies, where Bitcoin (BTC) profited from being the first to create blockchain technology as well as the first cryptocurrency. Because of Bitcoin's first-mover advantage, many people mistake cryptocurrencies for Bitcoin.</div>
<div>You must be able to reach out to consumers first and leave a lasting impression, which may lead to brand awareness and loyalty. You will also be able to manage resources by locating in a strategic area, creating a premium contract with essential suppliers, or acquiring skilled personnel.</div>
<div>FMA has a lot of advantages, however, it also comes with some cons, such as being the first product or service in an industry does not always provide you with an advantage. Also, you may spend a lot of money persuading clients to try out a new product. Later entrants would benefit from these educated buyers and would not have to invest as much money in consumer training.</div>
<div>Newcomers to the field can avoid the errors you made as to the first mover. If the first entrant fails to capture the attention of customers with their products, subsequent entrants may capitalize on this.</div>
<div>Overall, being an FMA is beneficial in emerging markets like blockchain where advancements are yet to be made.</div>

<h2>What Is a Fish?</h2>
<div>A fish, or minnow, is someone who holds insignificant amounts of cryptocurrencies, often at the mercy of whales who move the market up and down.</div>
<p>The actions of minnows are unlikely to significantly affect market share — but this can change as a minnow’s holdings increase. </p>
<div>Once they increase the minnow can become a dolphin and ultimately reach whale status. The change in status to dolphin or whale means these players can significantly affect cryptocurrency prices. </div>
<p>For example, Bitcoin dolphins can be defined as the segment of players who place orders of 1,000 BTC or more on cryptocurrency exchanges. </p>
<p>Bitcoin whales are usually hedge funds or huge institutional giants who place massive orders of amounts bigger than those placed by dolphins. </p>
<p>Notable examples of BTC whales include Tesla and MicroStrategy to name a few.</p>
<div>Orders placed by whales are usually handled through special arrangements via exchanges and typically cannot be seen by standard retail traders. </div>
<p>The cryptocurrency movements of BTC whales can significantly impact the BTC market. </p>
<div>BTC whales lead to increased volatility, outsized moves and/or reduced liquidity in the BTC market. </div>
<p>It is worth noting BTC whales set the tone for minnows to speculate on the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. </p>
<p>This can cause a dangerous cycle where the price of cryptocurrencies become disconnected with fundamental drivers of cryptocurrencies. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Flash Crash?</h2>
<div>A flash crash is a market condition where an asset’s price falls very rapidly within a very brief time interval, then rebounds back to previous levels in an equally short time. In the cryptocurrency space, a flash crash can take place within hours or even minutes. High-frequency trading is among the leading causes of such catastrophes in the crypto market.</div>
<div>The volatility of digital currencies naturally includes extreme downward price movements. In turn, gripping selling pressures lead to rapid shifts in crypto prices, which result in flash crashes in many cases.</div>
<div>Flash crashes also happen in other industries, such as the stock and foreign exchange markets. Some notable hits in the stock market include the July 2015 flash where an impact on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) halted trading for over three hours. Other examples include the 2014 bond flash crash, which was caused by algorithm-focused trading programs, and the spoofing-ignited 2010 Dow crash. </div>
<div>The crypto landscape triggers flash crashes differently. For example, in 2021, Bitcoin experienced a flash crash where roughly $310 billion was wiped off the digital currency market, triggering $10 billion worth of BTC liquidations. </div>
<div>The crash was a result of the blackouts that occurred in the Xinjiang region in China, where some of the largest Bitcoin mining farms in the world sit. Further analyses indicated power blackouts in its cities caused nearly half of Bitcoin’s network to go offline, dipping from 215 to 120 exahash per second, which caused a massive selloff.</div>

<title>Flash Loan</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A flash loan is a transaction in which a specific quantity of liquidity is borrowed and repaid in the same transaction or block.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Flash Loan?</h2>
<div>A flash loan is a type of DeFi loan that is swiftly processed, acquired, and repaid in a short period without the need for collateral. Flash loans are an innovative solution offered by the Aave platform that is enabled by the way data is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. </div>
<div>There is no delay between borrowing and repaying the funds since everything is handled synchronously. Atomic composability is thus required for flash loans to operate, as everything must either settle or fail at the same time.</div>
<div>Flash loans do not require collateral because there is no credit or counterparty risk. As a result, flash loans are extremely capital-efficient, as they offer high amounts of leverage. This kind of capital efficiency is only attainable in DeFi and not in regular financial markets.</div>
<div>Flash loans are often funded through lending protocols, like Aave or CREAM, which provide single-transaction loans as a function that enables them to be combined with other dApps, like Uniswap or Sushiswap.</div>
<div>Although the transactions are swift, flash loans are not safe from exploits, a term called flash loan attacks is often used, which is a type of DeFi attack in which a bad actor obtains a flash loan through a lending protocol and manipulates the market in their favor using different types of black-hat techniques. </div>
<div>The most popular forms of DeFi assaults are flash loan attacks, which are the cheapest to carry out and the simplest to get away with. They've been making headlines since DeFi's meteoric rise in the past year, and they’ve become much worse in 2021, with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to date.</div>
<div>With a flash loan, a user can borrow as much as they want without any upfront costs. If you want to borrow $50,000 worth of ETH, for example, a lending protocol will provide it to you instantly, but that doesn't imply it's yours. You must do something with the borrowed funds to repay the debt and maybe pocket any remaining funds.</div>
<div>To make this work, the procedure must be quick, and the debt must be paid to the protocol promptly, otherwise, the transaction will be reversed. Because the commitment to pay your loan is enforced by a blockchain, a decentralized lender does not demand collateral from you.</div>
<p>Attackers of flash loans rely on devising new ways to distort the market while still adhering to the blockchain's laws.</p>
<div>Some popular examples of flash loan attacks are the PancakeBunny attack, Alpha Homora Protocol hack, DeFi yield farming aggregator ApeRocket flash loan attack, and many others.</div>
<div>To avoid such attacks, instead of depending on a single DEX for its price feed, DeFi platforms could leverage decentralized pricing oracles like Chainklink and Band Protocol to decrease the attack vector for flash loan attacks.</div>
<div>The lag in reaction times from makers of DeFi platforms is one of the most important aspects that allow exploiters to just get away with flash loan assaults. To avoid this from happening, automated tools should be used. OpenZeppelin Defender, a technology that allows project managers to identify smart contract vulnerabilities and other strange behavior, allowing them to respond quickly and neutralize threats. </div>

<preview>Flash loan attacks are when malicious actors exploit a smart contract.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Flash Loan Attack?</h2>
<div>Flash loan attacks are decentralized finance (DeFi) exploits where a smart contract designated to support the provision of flash loans is attacked in order to siphon assets stored in any particular pool. In such attacks, the malicious actor opens a loan, uses that borrowed capital to purchase other assets with arbitrage and quickly pays their loan back, taking the assets left with them throughout the whole process as their profit.</div>
<div>It is important to understand that this exposure can only happen within DeFi protocols since they are permissionless and entirely run by smart contracts. While disintermediation provides a lot of benefits like cost savings and censorship resistance, having no third party overseeing the provision of uncollateralized loans provided through flash loan contracts make DeFi platforms susceptible to such attacks. </div>
<p>This type of malicious activity is actually complex and difficult to pull off, yet somehow there are many cases where cybercriminals have succeeded in this endeavor. </p>
<div>Most flash loan attacks involve using borrowed capital to arbitrage assets from other DeFi protocols. For instance, in one of the bZx protocol attack, the hacker took out a loan from a contract and immediately converted it into stablecoins. But since smart contracts only function based on the data fed to them, they can be vulnerable to some exploits. The attacker took advantage of that by manipulating the price of the stablecoin, sUSD, by placing a large buy order on it, which helped drive the price of the stablecoin to twice the value it was supposed to be. From there, he took out a bigger loan using the sUSD he swapped as collateral. Then, he repaid all these loans and took away the remaining assets with him as profit.</div>
<p>Another well-known flash loan attack occurred earlier on, on the same platform. The flash loan attacker took out a flash loan on dYdx, which is a lending DApp, and sent the capital from that flash loan to both Compound and Fulcrum — on Fulcrum, the attacker shorted ETH against Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), while also taking out a Compound loan of WBTC. Without getting too much into the specifics, when WTBC's price pumped due to the effects of Fulcrum acquiring WBTC, the flash loan attacker flipped their WBTC on Uniswap, repaid their own and got away with any of the leftover ETH.</p>
<div>In May 2021, popular Binance Smart Chain-based yield farming aggregator PancakeBunny experienced a flash loan attack as well. The flash loan attacker borrowed a large amount of BNB on PancakeBunny, thus manipulating its price against both the Binance USD stablecoin and Bunny tokens — when the flash loan hacker dumped their Bunny on the market, the price plummeted.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Are Flash Loans?</h2>
<div>A flash loan is a type of uncollateralized lending that is used across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols based on the Ethereum network.</div>
<p>Flash loans are essentially types of loans that have specific properties to them. They were created as part of the general movement to make financial instruments more accessible to the masses, without the need for intermediaries like banks and other traditional financial institutions. DeFi, and flash loans, are part of the process of creating a permissionless and transparent financial ecosystem for the future.</p>
<p>Flash loans are not the only decentralized financial instrument to come out of DeFi — other innovations include decentralized exchanges, decentralized exchange offerings, non-fungible tokens and more.</p>
<p>Flash loans use smart contracts, which are tools enabled by a blockchain that do not let funds change hands unless specific rules are met. In the case of the flash loan, the rule is that the borrower has to pay back the loan before the transaction actually ends, otherwise, the smart contract itself reserves the transaction as if it never happened.</p>
<p>Often lenders will require borrowers to put up collateral in order to ensure that if the borrower cannot pay back the loan, the lender is still able to get their money back. There is no guarantee that a bank will give you a loan, even if you have a good credit score. This is where the idea of &quot;secured loans&quot; comes from — these are the loans that you will need if for whatever reason, a bank needs more assurance that you will pay them back. With secured loans, you need to put up an asset as collateral — this could be anything from valuable jewelry to property.</p>
<p>There's also an unsecured loan, where no collateral is required. This lack of collateral however, does not mean that the flash loan lender will not get their money back. It means that it will just be sent back in a different way, where instead of offering collateral, the borrower has to pay back the money right away.</p>
<p>It make be elementary to repeat, but it's important to understand the regular loans also come with a caveat — interest rates. This means that when you take out a loan through a traditional financial institution, you are almost always agreeing to pay back even more money than you borrowed. This is the bank's way of charging you for letting you use its money until you have the money of your own to pay them back. An easy example of this is a credit card. You spend $100 one month, but pay it off over two months — you will be paying a bit more than just two installments of $50.</p>
<p>Obtaining and fulfilling a loan is typically a long process. If a borrower gets approved for a loan, they have to pay it back throughout a period of months or even years. This isn't the case with flash loans. In flash loans, it’s instantaneous. The smart contract for the loan has to be fulfilled in the same transaction which is lent out, and this means that the borrower has to call on other smart contracts in order to perform instant trades with the loaned capital, before the transaction itself ends, and this is a process which typically takes only a few seconds to complete.</p>

<preview>A hypothetical scenario where Ethereum's market cap overtakes Bitcoin's.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Flippening?</h2>
<div>A situation hoped for by Ethereum fans, where the total market cap of Ether surpasses the total market cap of Bitcoin.</div>
<p>The term was invented in 2017, and is a phrase describing the potential moment when ETH will become the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As it stands, Bitcoin, which was the first cryptocurrency to be invented, has the biggest market cap and is streets ahead.</p>
<p>The market cap of Bitcoin has plunged at certain points, particularly in early 2018. </p>
<p>This gave rise to the idea that flippening may take place. </p>
<p>A key factor that prompted speculation that a flippening would take place stemmed from the belief Ethereum provides greater flexibility and the added advantage of being able to write smart contracts. </p>
<p>Some degree of internal flippening occurred in November 2019. </p>
<div>The number of ERC-20 transactions exceeded the number of transactions completed using Ethereum itself.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Flipping?</h2>
<p>Flipping is an investment strategy (mostly popularized by real estate investing) where you buy something with the goal of reselling for a profit later, usually in a short period of time. </p>
<div>In the context of ICOs, flipping refers to the strategy of investing in tokens before they are listed on exchanges, then quickly reselling them for a profit when they start trading on exchanges in the secondary market.</div>
<div>Flipping can occur with any cryptocurrency or asset, but “Bitcoin flipping” is a common phrase in the industry. </div>
<div>This occurs when a market participant purchases a certain quantity of Bitcoin at a price with the hope of shortly selling it later for a higher price. </div>
<p>The strategy of Bitcoin flipping can be particularly useful during times of high volatility and price spikes. </p>
<p>It also makes it much easier to capitalize on the frenzy that has engulfed cryptocurrency markets. </p>
<p>Listing a cryptocurrency on an exchange can often boost confidence in the cryptocurrency as well as the price. </p>
<p>This is because those cryptos prices often rise after an ICO compared with their pre-ICO price.</p>

<file>fomo.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An acronym that stands for &quot;Fear of Missing Out.&quot;</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is FOMO?</h2>
<p>“Fear Of Missing Out” — otherwise referred to as FOMO for short — is a term that is used to express the anxiety you could feel if you don’t act quickly when making trading decisions. The idea behind it is that any delay could cause you to miss out on a potential opportunity.</p>
<p>For example, you might get FOMO when you see a coin that you don’t own, increasing in value. That green line ticking upwards is enough to spark panic in some, causing them to race to buy whichever coin seems to be soaring in price. The fear of missing that next big win, the coin everyone wants (but can’t have) or being the trader left behind, can be a driving force in price variations.</p>
<p>Of course, trading in cryptocurrency can also be a game of rumors and emotion, and FOMO can play a key role when traders decide what to, buy, sell or hold on to. FOMO can even lead some to switch markets or pull their assets out of a certain market entirely, placing them into their own cold wallets.</p>
<p>While the emphasis on FOMO is more often placed on the fear of missing out on a profit-driving coin, the opposite can also be true.</p>
<div>A sudden drop in Bitcoin could be attributed to a variety of causes, with trades happening at dizzying speeds. Whispers of government regulations or markets that are out of favor are enough to cause many to oversell.</div>
<p>When coins surge to an all-time high, traders may also want to cash in while it’s hot, leading others to follow suit. Holding out means you might sell when the price is already falling again, so you would have missed out on the big profits of a price peak. In the world of crypto, anything can happen.</p>

<preview>Forks, or chain splits, create an alternate version of the blockchain, leaving two blockchains to run simultaneously.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Fork (Blockchain)?</h2>
<p>When changes are made to blockchain technology they’re referred to as a “fork.”</p>
<div>A fork happens when there is a split in the blockchain network, causing there to be two different versions. With the blockchain network being open source, anyone can contribute to improvements and changes within the code, which often results in blockchain updates. There are also times when forks can be conducted to enable new features to a blockchain, to eliminate bugs, or to address the effects of major hacking - like we saw with Ethereum.</div>
<p>Another reason a fork can occur is when the miners’ software updates don’t align with one another. If this happens the mining community has to decide which path the blockchain should take. If a decision can’t be reached, or the community itself can’t agree, two different versions of the blockchain will exist.</p>
<p>The extremities to which the blockchain will change is dependent on whether a hard fork or a soft fork takes place.</p>
<p>A soft fork is the addition of a new rule to the protocol, which is still compatible with older rules and is backwards compatible.  This means that upgraded nodes can still communicate with non-upgraded nodes. In other words, new blocks will still be recognized as valid by old nodes, so it’s less of a dramatic change.</p>
<div>A hard fork is a radical change in the networks protocol which can result in new digital currencies, for example when the Bitcoin blockchain split into two, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash.</div>
<p>A hard fork happens when a permanent change takes place in the blockchain network. This change isn’t backwards compatible, which means that all nodes or users would need to upgrade to the new version of the software, as the older version wouldn’t work anymore. The new version would create its own transactions and blocks. Essentially, it’s an entirely new blockchain.</p>

<preview>When an entirely new program has been developed from source code, taken from an open source software.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Fork (Software)?</h2>
<p>Forking within software is when an entirely new project is created by developers who have used source copy from another software package. Forking creates a new path for the software, splitting it into a different version. In the open-source community forking is very common and generally thought of as positive.</p>
<p>Often forks happen when a significant number of developers branch off in a different direction in order to improve upon the project and potentially to replace it.</p>
<p>Developers begin by taking a legal copy of course code from a software package and starting their own development on it, creating a new version of the software. Free and open-source software makes this possible and legal, without violating any copyright laws. This means that this type of software can be legally forked without obtaining any prior permission from those managing the project of distributing the software. The idea is then to release your improvements so that the entire community can benefit from them.</p>
<p>While forks are seen as a symbol of freedom, resulting in useful updates, they can often occur because of clashes between the developer communities, igniting opposing views. The largest group of developers is usually the one who will keep the original name and hang on to the user community. Software forks can divide developer communities, with the split either being amicable, or filled with resentment.</p>
<p>Competing projects can also mean that developers no longer share code, with successors, resulting in future problems of legitimacy, ownership and direction.</p>
<p>Unlike free and open-source software, proprietary software is licensed by copyright owners, who have exclusive legal rights. A fork can only take place with this type of software if the owner of the copyright has granted permission and needs a fork to create a new version of the software.</p>

<title>Fractional Stablecoins</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fractional-stablecoins</url>
<file>fractional-stablecoins.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A fractional stablecoin is one that is backed in two ways: collaterally-backed and algorithmically modified.</preview>
<description>
<div>Fractional stablecoins are a new form of stablecoin and cryptocurrency that is partially backed by collateral and partially stabilized algorithmically. There’s many variations and flavors to the fractional stablecoin model, such as partially backing it with liquidity or partially allowing redemptions, but the general idea is still the same, namely that the protocol mints more stablecoins than it has value to redeem all of them against. A stablecoin is a digital asset built on the blockchain that is designed to maintain a price peg at a designated price, most often, $1. In order to maintain their use and legitimacy as a payment method, they must have some backing in fiat cash, cryptocurrency or on-chain tokens that it can be redeemed/swapped against. This backing is called collateral. A fractional stablecoin is one that is backed in two ways: collaterally-backed and algorithmically modified. A fractional stablecoin has a collateralization ratio of less than or equal to 100%, meaning the stablecoin can be backed by less real dollars/cryptocurrency — a fraction thereof — than it’s supposed total worth. This method improves capital efficiency as less dollars are required to remain idle as collateral. Think of it another way: fractional stablecoins have a larger circulating supply of tokens than they do liquidity or collateral. They typically almost always have algorithmic mechanisms to prevent bank runs through economic incentives and game theory.  </div>
<p>If the price rises above $1, the algorithmic systems produce new stablecoins until the price returns to $1. If the stablecoin is overcollateralized, the process works in reverse and the available stablecoins or tokens will be burned. </p>
<p>Purely algorithmic stablecoins are difficult to bootstrap, are slow to grow and experience extreme periods of volatility which counteracts the mission of being a stablecoin. A fractional stablecoin utilises algorithms to increase or decrease collateral to maintain its peg by generating or burning the number of stablecoins or digital tokens available. </p>
<p>Author:</p>
<div>Sam Kazemian is the founder of FRAX, a fractional algorithmic stablecoin that is partially backed by collateral and stabilized algorithmically, and the only fractional stablecoin that has maintained its peg since its conception. FRAX is open-source and permissionless, bringing a truly trustless, scalable and stable asset to the future of decentralized finance. Kazemian brings a wealth of experience as a leading blockchain entrepreneur and crypto enthusiast, as the co-founder of the blockchain based knowledge base, Everipedia.

<title>Fraud Proof</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fraud-proof</url>
<file>fraud-proof.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A fraud proof is a technological method that functions as a bond in a decentralized environment that uses Optimistic Rollups (ORs)</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Fraud Proof?</h2>
<div>The term 'fraud' is defined as wrong conduct committed with the goal of gaining an illegal advantage by depriving the victim of a right. Tax fraud, credit card fraud, wire fraud, and many others are all examples. Fraudulent conduct can be perpetrated by a single person, a group of people, or a company as a whole.</div>
<div>In the world of blockchain, the term fraud proofs represent a technical method that is critical to enabling on-chain scalability of blockchains (for example, through sharding or larger blocks) while ensuring that on-chain data is available and correct. Fraud proofs use Optimistic Rollups (ORs) that serve two functions: reduce costs and lower latency levels for decentralized applications on a blockchain network.</div>
<div>To reward good performance, a sequencer required to process ORs must provide a fraud-proof with their work. Sequencers are compensated financially for executing rollups per the consensus rules, and they are penalized monetarily for breaking them by forfeiting their fraud proof.</div>
<div>State transition fraud proofs work well, but they rely on a crucial assumption that all of the block data is available. It is impossible to establish that a block miner is incorrect if it merely publishes the block header without the correct contents.</div>
<div>Furthermore, even if 99% of the data is accessible, the remaining 1% may be required to establish the validity of a block as we require complete data availability. This is a rigorous need for block validation because data might be inaccessible for a variety of reasons, not only malevolent nodes. Making data unavailability difficult for a rogue node is the proper solution.</div>
<div>Scaling public blockchains requires the use of fraud proofs and erasure codes. They allow light nodes to make their own decisions about which blocks to reject without having to rely on a plurality of trustworthy full-nodes.</div>
<div>Even if brief zero-knowledge proofs could be used to confirm the correctness, an intruder/scammer getting away with publicizing inaccessible blocks and having them included in the chain is still a big problem, because it prevents all other validators from fully computing the state or making blocks that communicate with the part of the state that is no longer available.</div>
<div>Fraud proofs show that a state transition was made incorrectly. The fundamental benefit of fraud proofs is that they aren't required for every state transition, but only when things go wrong. As a result, they use less computing resources and are more suited to a scalability-constrained setting. The interaction of these protocols is their biggest disadvantage: they establish a 'dialogue' between numerous participants. A dialogue/interaction/communication necessitates the presence of the parties, particularly the party alleging fraud and permits other parties to disrupt the conversation in various ways.</div>

<title>Front Running</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Front running is when you place a transaction in a queue when you have knowledge of a future transaction.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Front Running?</h2>
<div>Front running is the act of placing a transaction in a queue with the knowledge of a future transaction. Front running on a blockchain platform normally happens when a miner, who has access to information on pending transactions, places an order that would earn him a profit based on a pending trade. For instance, on the Ethereum blockchain, front running can occur when bots are able to quote a higher gas price than a pending trade, thus, hastening its processing.</div>
<p>Other parties capable of front running are full node operators, which are parties tasked with keeping an eye on network activities, hence, have knowledge of unconfirmed transactions. Centralized exchanges can also conduct frontrunning, however, it would be against their best interest to cheat their own customers. Front running can also be orchestrated through other methods. Generalized front running taps into potentially profitable contract calls. </p>
<p>Other types of attacks include displacement, insertion and suppression. With a displacement attack, the malicious actor displaces a genuine transaction with their own. Although the original transaction may still run, it won’t have the positive effect as intended. On the other hand, an insertion attack sandwiches a genuine transaction between two transactions with the aim of making a profit without holding an asset. </p>
<p>The suppression attack is meant to delay others from running a transaction. When the withholding is lifted, the front runner is less concerned about the suppressed trade.</p>
<div>Front running can be mitigated by sequencing transactions and improving transaction confidentiality. Transaction sequencing is achievable through implementations such as Canonical Transaction Ordering Rule like the one employed by BCH (Bitcoin Cash). Confidentiality, on the other hand, is applicable on different sections of a decentralized application (DApp).</div>

<h2>What Is FUD?</h2>
<p>An acronym that stands for “Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt.” It is a strategy to influence perception of certain cryptocurrencies or the cryptocurrency market in general by spreading negative, misleading or false information. *see FUDster.</p>
<div>FUD is sometimes a word used by the crypto community to describe the skepticism of cryptocurrency that is temporarily bearish for the inevitable crypto market. Many crypto enthusiasts will use the term to describe anything that opposes against bitcoin or crypto. They will sometimes dismiss those who are cynical of cryptocurrency as shills spreading FUD (FUDsters).  </div>
<p>FUDsters are the opposite of laser-eyed Bitcoin and crypto Twitter advocates. These perceived antagonists and alleged crypto naysayers include personalities like Warren Buffet, economist Paul Krugman, and occasionally Elon Musk (although he has had a love/hate relationship with crypto).</p>
<p>The FUD meaning encompasses all talking points from crypto nonbelievers. These topics include arguments from some traditional economists and politicians, including a selection of “greatest hits” such as:</p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts often dismiss these topics as debunked, inconsequential or downright propaganda from government entities. FUD is a murky term, but its meaning is generally descriptive of derogatory derailments surrounding the topic of cryptocurrency. The term is widely embraced on mediums like Reddit, Twitter and Discord that support the crypto community.</p>

<title>Fully Diluted Value (FDV)</title>

<file>fully-diluted-value-fdv.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>FDV is the total worth or market cap of a cryptocurrency if the entire supply of tokens were in circulation.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Fully Diluted Value (FDV)?</h2>
<p>Today, investors consider fully diluted valuation as well when investing in a company or cryptocurrency project. So, it can be taken as a metric to understand the tokenomics of a project. </p>
<p>To determine the fully diluted value of a cryptocurrency, you need to take the total supply of a coin and then multiply that number by the price per coin. To find this out, you'll have to do a little research on the specific cryptocurrency you're interested in.</p>
<h2>Market Cap vs Fully Dilated Value </h2>
<div>For example, if there is a circulating supply of 10,000 tokens of ABC cryptocurrency, and each has a value of $1, then the market cap for this cryptocurrency is $10,000.</div>
<p>However, there may be more tokens coming into existence in the future. For example, coins or tokens are held back from public sale for later release by their creators in order to fund development or marketing initiatives. In these cases, it may be useful to think about what would happen if all those coins were released into circulation simultaneously at the current market price. This gives an indication of what your price would be per share/token if you bought today and all else remained unchanged. Every cryptocurrency project announces its maximum supply in its initial stages and the time frame to achieve it. </p>
<p>If ABC cryptocurrency has a maximum supply of 1 million tokens, its FDV will be $1 million. </p>
<p>The concept of FDV can be applied to traditional trading or stock markets as well. </p>
<p>The fully diluted value of the company is the amount you would pay if you bought all outstanding stock, plus all stock that could potentially be issued, such as options and convertible debt. Fully diluted value is important for investors to know because it gives them a complete picture of the future of the company. This can help them assess whether the investment is favorable.</p>
<p>Options and convertible debt are two sources of stocks that affect fully diluted value. Options are contracts that give the holder the right to purchase shares at a set price in the future. If you factor in all options as current stock, then you get the fully diluted value of the company. Convertible debt is a type of loan that allows debt holders to convert their loans into shares in the company at a set price.</p>
<p>If you calculate a fully diluted value without including these two sources, you could underestimate the investment cost and make poor investment decisions. For example, if your initial estimate of a company's value was $100 million, but it had $50 million worth of options outstanding and $30 million worth of convertible debt, your actual cost would come out as $180 million — 80% more than your initial estimate.</p>
<p>Whether or not FDV is a strong metric to be taken into consideration is still a debate. Some investors see it as a powerful metric while others call it a misleading concept when it comes to cryptocurrency investment. </p>

<title>Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fully-homomorphic-encryption</url>
<file>fully-homomorphic-encryption.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Fully homomorphic encryption is a type of scheme where one can perform arbitrary computations on encrypted data.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption?</h2>
<div>Fully homomorphic encryption is a form of the encryption scheme that allows computations to be performed on data while it is encrypted. Its goal is to allow for computations on ciphertexts in such a way that it never has to be decrypted for intermediate steps during the computation. </div>
<p>This provides powerful functionality for use cases like cloud computing and big data analytics, where the processing of large amounts of data is required, but sensitive or proprietary information must be kept private from third parties.</p>
<p>This idea sounds impossible. How can you perform operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) on data without decrypting it?</p>
<p>The problem is that keys for encryption and decryption are separate in traditional encryption schemes, and performing operations on encrypted data requires decrypting it first.</p>
<p>With fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), you also have an encryption key, but unlike traditional schemes, you can compute on plaintext in an arbitrary way without ever decrypting it.</p>
<h2>The Usefulness of Homomorphic Encryption</h2>
<p>It is a tremendously useful property, allowing for computation on sensitive data without revealing it to the entity performing the computation. </p>
<p>For example, consider a database of medical information that is fully homomorphic encrypted. An encryption key can be given to a doctor, who can perform queries on the database to determine whether patients with specific symptoms have been treated. This allows the doctor to get information about their patients without having access to the actual data in the database.</p>
<h2>How Is FHE Different From Other Forms of Homomorphic Encryption?</h2>
<p>In terms of the possibility of computations over encrypted data, homomorphic encryption has different types; partially, somewhat, leveled fully, and fully homomorphic encryption.</p>
<p>Partially homomorphic and somewhat homomorphic allow for only a particular type of operation over encrypted data, that too with limited repetition. </p>
<p>Fully homomorphic encryption supports an unlimited number of operations over encrypted data. Also, the operation can be applied an unlimited number of times. </p>
<h2>Benefits of Fully Homomorphic Encryption</h2>
<p>FHE can be used to store sensitive private data on third-party servers and still allow computation on that private data while keeping it encrypted. The server administrators can not find out what computations were done on the private data (assuming a secure FHE implementation).</p>
<p>FHE eliminates the tradeoff between the usability of data and its privacy. Data privacy is preserved without needing to mask or remove any feature. </p>
<p>Proper FHE implementation means high-end resilience against quantum attacks, making this scheme quantum-safe.</p>
<p>FHE is still emerging and viewed as commercially infeasible so a lot of research has to happen before it becomes extensively usable.</p>

<title>Funding Payments</title>

<file>funding-payments.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Funding payments are periodic payments between traders. These are designed to reduce the discrepancy between the perpetual market price and the spot market price.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Funding Payments?</h2>
<div>Funding payments are used in cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges for perpetual contracts to drive the trade price closer to the index price of the underlying asset.</div>
<div>Since a perpetual contract is a derivative, its price isn’t always the same as the underlying asset. As an example, during a bull market, the price of a BTC perpetual contract is usually higher than the price of BTC in the spot market, because people tend to be more bullish and expect the price to keep going up. </div>
<p>To reduce the price discrepancy between the perpetual market and the spot market, derivatives exchanges adopt a mechanism called “funding payments”. The way funding payments work is that there are automatic payments between traders at fixed intervals (e.g. every hour, or every 8 hours) where traders on the more popular side (the long side during a bull market) pay the less popular side (the short side during a bull market). By doing this, people are incentivized to open a position on the less popular side, hence driving the price toward the spot price. </p>
<div>It differs from one trading venue to another, but normally, funding payments are calculated by the notional value of a trader’s position multiplied by a rate that reflects the price discrepancy in a given interval (1 hour or 8 hours). This rate is also known as the “funding rate”. The greater the price discrepancy in a given interval, the higher the funding rate will be. These rates are positive when the contract price is above the spot price, in which case short position holders receive funding payments from long position holders. When the rates are negative, long position holders receive funding from short position holders.</div>
<p>The funding rate effectively implies a cost of capital and the steepness of the futures curve, and indicates trader sentiment on a given exchange. It is not an interest charge nor a fee that traders pay to hold the position. The rates may vary freely depending on market conditions. Some exchanges place limits to prevent traders from facing extreme rates.</p>

<title>Fungible</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/fungible</url>
<file>fungible.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>In cryptocurrency, fungibility is when a coin or token can be replaced by any other identical coin or token.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Does Fungible Mean?</h2>
<p>Fungible refers to a coin’s fungibility. Fungibility refers to a specific currency’s ability to maintain one standard value. As well, it needs to have uniform acceptance. This means that a currency’s history should not be able to affect its value, and this is due to the fact that each piece that is a part of the currency is equal in value when compared to every other piece of that exact same currency.</p>
<div>In the world of cryptocurrencies, this is essentially a coin or a token that can be replaced by another identical coin or token, and they are both mutually interchangeable.</div>
<p>Now, you have real-world cases that are highly specific, such as gold. Gold is generally considered to be fungible due to the fact that one gold ounce is equivalent to another gold ounce; however, in some cases, this is not the case. When a fungible good is given a serial number or other identifying marks, it could no longer be fungible going forward. So for the sake of this example, if you added numbers to a gold bar, it would become distinguishable when compared to another gold bar.</p>
<p>To further explain, we can look at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The bank offers gold custody services to central banks as well as governments from all across the world. It does this by storing the gold bars in an underground vault, and all of the gold bars are then deposited while being weighted with precision. They have purity markings on the individual bars. These markings are in turn inspected for authenticity.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Are Futures?</h2>
<div>Futures, also known as futures contracts, are legally-binding agreements to trade a given asset or commodity at a previously-agreed date and price in the future. In addition, they track the price movement of an underlying asset or commodity.</div>
<div>Futures fall in the category of derivative financial instruments since their value comes from another asset. To elaborate, investors can use them to track the price of natural gas, the S&amp;P 500 index, U.S. dollar, bonds, Bitcoin (BTC), wheat, etc. In the futures world, expiration dates make a huge influence on the results.</div>
<p>Dates are tied to the expiration month to give a distinctive description. For instance, December Bitcoin futures refer to BTC futures contracts expiring in December.</p>
<p>Notably, futures trading platforms offer leverage functionalities. As such, traders only need a percentage of the total contract value, and the rest is leveraged or borrowed from the platform. The required initial amount is called a margin. A trader's reputation on creditworthiness and a trading platform's conditions on leveraged trading determine the margin.</p>
<p>During maturation, a futures contract can be physically settled or cash-settled. Physically-settled futures refer to a type of futures where the underlying asset is exchanged during expiry.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a cash-settled futures contract is used to describe a contract where, upon maturation, the underlying asset is settled by first converting it to cash.</p>
<p>A common term in the futures world is a tick. This is the slightest price movement of a futures contract during a 24-hour period. Note that a tick can indicate an increase or decrease in price.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Gains refer to an increase in value or profit.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Gains?</h2>
<div>Gains refer to a value appreciation. Also called profits, gains emanate from selling an asset, either physical or digital, at a higher price than its initial buying price. For example, if a trader bought Bitcoin at $10K and sold it for $18K, he has an $8K profit. However, the real gain is calculated by considering the cost of maintaining the asset.</div>
<div>For instance, during trading, the investor incurred a $1 transaction fee, then the real gain is less the transaction fees. Other factors like physical property, maintenance costs, agent’s fees, and other factors eat into the profits made. On financial books, gains occupy the credit column.</div>
<p>Apart from having realized profits, gains can also be unrealized. Unrealized gains occur when an asset’s price appreciates, but the investor doesn’t sell it during this stage. Often, unrealized profits in the cryptocurrency sector, for example, are caused by a highly volatile market where prices can oscillate between two price extremes within a very short time.</p>
<p>Gains occur in different shapes. There are gross and net profits. Gross profits occur before subtracting the expenses and other overheads incurred between an asset’s purchase and selling date. On the other hand, net yields are the final amount after factoring in the fees. In most jurisdictions, gains are subject to taxes.</p>
<p>However, the tax due primarily depends on the traded asset. Apart from the United States and a few other countries, cryptocurrency gains remain largely untaxed due to the unclear regulatory atmosphere across the globe. In most jurisdictions, tax on Bitcoin gains follows the same formulae applied to capital gains.</p>

<title>Game Channels</title>

<file>game-channels.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Game channels are the newest technological advancement in the world of blockchain gaming, as they enable fast gameplay by removing the wait time for block confirmations.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Game Channels?</h2>
<div>To understand the role of game channels, one needs to realize the working principle of blockchain games. In general, blockchain games are available via fully decentralized and trustless environments. While it removes any centralized authority and ensures provably fair play, blockchain games do encounter the usual “technical difficulties.”</div>
<p>For instance, as more players join a game, storing all of the files and data on the underlying blockchain network will eventually result in scalability challenges. Additionally, when it comes to multiplayer gaming or other PvP (player vs player) matches, it is pertinent that each player gets to make their moves quickly. However, most blockchain games don’t offer this functionality, as they need to create a transaction between each move, which takes time depending on the network congestion.</p>
<div>Game channels solve this problem while offering more features for blockchain games. By design, applications using game channels are protocols that facilitate secure off-chain transactions between players. Accordingly, game channels can be used to build private channels that will run parallel to the main chain but in their own space (off-chain) and near-real-time. With game channels, any blockchain network can increase its scalability to support numerous games and dApps without compromising transaction speeds.</div>
<p>In addition, game channels provide purely decentralized and trustless dispute resolution without requiring a third-party or central authority. In a way, game channels can be considered individual payment channels for specific games.</p>
<h2>How Do Game Channels Work?</h2>
<p>The main objective of game channels is to facilitate real-time gameplay between players. Since most blockchain games add transactions for every move and those transactions need to get mined into blocks before they become &quot;active&quot;, there is a noticeable delay that players have to adjust to before they can make another move.</p>
<p>Game channels enable players to take their gameplay on a secure off-chain network. As such, the time between moves is cut down by a considerable amount, granting players the opportunity to enjoy the game in near-real-time.</p>
<p>Let’s consider an example to understand how game channels work. For instance, two players set up a game channel to compete in a turn-based card game for prize money (tokens). Both players settle on the rules and guidelines for the game, co-fund the prize money, and open the game channel. They start playing via the game channel, and once the predefined win/loss criteria are met, the smart contract releases the funds to the winner’s account, all records are entered into the ledger (on the main chain), and the game channel closes.</p>
<p>Amidst this, both players are still connected to the public blockchain network on which the card game is originally supported. If one of the players tries to cheat and enters an invalid outcome on the public ledger, the other player is able to trustlessly prove this and enforce the game rules correctly.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Game Theory?</h2>
<div>Developed by John von Neumann, game theory is one of the most widely-used theories within the study of economics. To put it simply, game theory is a way of creating a simplified interactive environment (a ‘game’) that allows researchers to model how people and entities will respond to certain actions. </div>
<h2>Examples of Game Theory</h2>
<div>One of the most famous game theory illustrations in action is the prisoner’s dilemma. The prisoner’s dilemma is a game in which the participants have a zero-sum incentive to harm each other and a non-zero-sum incentive for not hurting each other. It was conceived as a thought experiment that is a two-person non-cooperative variable-sum game. </div>
<p>Game theory can also be understood in the context of the digital assets marketplace. For instance, the Bitcoin market can be described as two types of investors, the holders (i.e. long-term investors) and the opportunists (i.e. short/medium-term investors). In general, holders will buy during low-volatility periods. Opportunists will end such periods and trigger volatility when they enter the market. Thus, each type of investor has two strategies they can use, depending on the behavior of the other type of investor. All are acting in their interests, competing for asymmetric rewards while cooperating to grow the overall value of BTC. This is a perfect application for game theory as it observes two separate groups of persons reacting and responding to the behavior of the other group — an ideal application for game theory.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is GameFi?</h2>
<div>GameFi is an amalgam of two words: gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). It is also referred to as play-to-earn (P2E) games. The concept of GameFi relies on the intersection of blockchain technology, gaming, and several forms of decentralized financial products, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), yield farming, borrowing and lending, and algorithmic stablecoins, etc.</div>
<div>The term, “GameFi,” first made its appearance in a tweet from Andre Conje, the father of DeFi, on September 10th, 2020. With the introduction of the term, gaming has lowered the entry barriers in the crypto space and revolutionized traditional gaming by offering participants an opportunity to generate income while playing. </div>
<p>In conventional games, the in-game assets that you purchase have no value outside the game’s universe. Players invest money to procure these assets, but they don’t have complete control over them. GameFi transforms this concept through blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and DeFi products. </p>
<div>Almost all of these blockchain-based games are accompanied by a corresponding in-game currency, a marketplace, and a token economy, usually managed and governed by the community. Players own their in-game items rather than developers with this model, thereby eliminating the need for any type of server infrastructure and preventing the possibility of game hacking or cheating.</div>
<p>By developing an economic model of making money while playing, the concept of GameFi has exposed the world to a new use case for cryptocurrencies. One of the significant reasons behind GameFi’s popularity is that no centralized authority controls the ecosystem, unlike traditional games. Additionally, the underlying blockchain technology allows for zero-fee transactions so that players can buy, sell, and trade digital assets without incurring fees.</p>
<div>The in-game currency offered by GameFi games can be swapped for other cryptocurrencies and fiat money. Players can also purchase (invest in) in-game NFTs and trade, rent, or sell them in open marketplaces to gain returns. For instance, you can buy a plot in the game and sell it to another player at your set price. Or, you can rent out the “Level 100 armor” to other players and earn extra income. </div>
<div>Simply put, GameFi has redefined the concept of ownership of in-game assets while adding extra layers to a token-based economy and the option to yield good returns via several DeFi products. With 800,000 active players in July, a staggering 121% growth from June, the GameFi universe has established itself as one of the fastest-growing sectors of the blockchain ecosystem.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Gas?</h2>
<div>Gas is the fee paid on the Ethereum network in return for using the platform’s computational power. Activities that require gas include launching decentralized applications (DApps) and simple transactions like sending ETH between traders. The fee is paid using Ether (ETH), the platform’s native currency.</div>
<div>Gas is consumed in small bits called gwei. One gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH. How much ETH is paid in a single transaction depends on the amount of resources required to carry a transaction to completion on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and the blockchain’s congestion level.</div>
<p>The cost of processing transactions was brought to the blockchain to make it easier to compute the resources used when executing a transaction. Furthermore, it differentiates between computational costs and the digital currency.</p>
<div>Additionally, charging a fee on every transaction prevents spamming incidents from malicious actors, hence, securing the network. Ethereum users can use ETH Gas Station to estimate their gas costs. Unfortunately, the lower the price, the more time it takes to be processed. This is because miners prioritize transactions with higher costs as it earns them more.</div>
<p>To make it easier to understand, let’s use an example of moving funds between traditional bank accounts. James moves $500K from his account to Susan’s account and pays $5 as the fee. On the ETH-powered network, the lump sum from James’ account is the total amount of ETH involved in a single transaction, and $5 is the gas charged to honor the transaction.</p>
<p>Note that gas on the Ethereum network is different from GAS on the NEO blockchain. On NEO, GAS is a currency on its own, while on Ethereum, it's a cost of running transactions.</p>

<title>Gas Limit</title>

<file>gas-limit.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A term used on the Ethereum platform that refers to the maximum amount of gas the user is willing to spend on a transaction.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Gas Limit?</h2>
<div>Gas limit is the highest cost an Ethereum user pays to push a transaction through the network. The limit set depends on the complexity of the activity you want to run the blockchain or the speed you want the transaction fulfilled. Since the ETH-powered platform is a huge ecosystem, it often sees an upsurge in transactions. As such, miners on the protocol tend to prioritize transactions with a high gas limit.</div>
<p>However, if traders set a higher gas limit and the entire amount is not consumed during processing, the extra amount goes back to the user’s account. Note that the services used determine the complexity of a transaction. For example, interacting with smart contracts often leads to high costs since the contracts need more resources to execute.</p>
<div>One advantage of having a gas limit feature is to prevent incorrect codes, especially in smart contracts, from charging more than what is required of a transaction. In the real world, gas can be compared to car fuel, while the gas limit is the car’s fuel tank.</div>
<p>In the above analogy, a driver needs to estimate the correct amount required for a particular trip to avoid inconveniences, such as an aborted journey. Similarly, Ethereum users must provide enough gas limits to prevent their transactions from being aborted and recorded as “Failed” on the blockchain. Unfortunately, when a transaction fails, the gas that is already consumed won’t be refunded. The ETH Gas Station provides an overview of the preferred gas limit. ETH wallets such as MetaMask provide a way to set the gas limit.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Gas Price?</h2>
<div>A general reference for approximate transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, gas price refers to the amount of ETH (in a small unit called gwei) that must be paid to miners for processing transactions on the network. One gwei equals 0.000000001 or 10-9 ETH.</div>
<div>The gas price is determined by an auction-type mechanism, where the miners look for the highest fees attached to a transaction, then process these transactions from there in descending order. </div>
<div>Gas prices fluctuate considerably over time and are naturally higher during high activity periods and decrease during periods when the network is underutilized. Most Ethereum wallets provide general references for gas prices with processing time comparisons with different gweis. </div>
<div>Most other blockchains and cryptocurrencies use similar mechanisms for managing and prioritizing which transaction will get processed first on the network. This mechanism ensures healthy competition and security for the blockchain by enacting a fair market mechanism and incentivizing more entities to provide computational power to the network. </div>
<p>Blockchain security and stability improves with the addition of computational power (measured in hash/second or h/sec and its metric denominations), since potential attackers would need to exceed this power to breach the blockchain’s security </p>
<div>Exorbitant gas prices have long been a major crux for Ethereum users, and hampers the network’s ability to scale. As more popular DeFi projects, DApps and decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap and SushiSwap operate on Ethereum, the more “congested” the network becomes and the higher gas prices climb. At the peak of the 2020 DeFi boom, Uniswap users paid up to $50 in gas fees per transaction! </div>
<div>Ethereum’s gas problem will likely be solved when the new proof-of-stake Ethereum 2.0 network finally rolls out in 2021 and uses staking instead of computational power to validate transactions.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Are Gas Station Networks (GSN)?</h2>
<div>The Gas Station Network (GSN) is a decentralized network of relayers mainly referring to the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to build decentralized applications (dApps) which provide payment for transactions, so users do not need to hold Ether or ETH to pay for gas, easing their onboarding process and improving user acquisition and experience.</div>
<p>However, while the relayers in the GSN do not charge users, they charge the recipient and contract instead. In this way, the relayers recover the costs of transactions and profit from extra fees for providing such services.</p>
<div>Originally conceived and designed by TabooKey, the GSN has grown to encompass many companies, protocols and platforms in the Ethereum ecosystem that wish to facilitate the onboarding of users to Ethereum applications. </div>
<p>While it may sound like a costly investment since Ethereum is notorious for slower transaction speeds and high fees when the network is congested, GSNs continue to thrive as their charges are still relatively much more affordable than the capital required for traditional marketing, user acquisition, and onboarding new users,  </p>
<p>GSNs have also continued to evolve and improve with time, providing greater convenience, with some allowing users to pay the platform or recipient off-chain in advance through traditional methods such as credit card, with each GSN usage deducting from their balance on the recipient platform’s system. </p>
<div>With regards to reliability and security issues, GSNs are set up in such a way that it is in the relayers' best interest to process requests of the platforms they serve properly, as there are measures in place to penalize them for malpractice. All of this is automated through smart contracts, greatly improving reliability and user experience (UX).

<description>
<h2>What Are Gems?</h2>
<p>Gem is a term for relatively unknown low-cap coins that have immense potential or are grossly undervalued. Recognizing potential gems is tricky since there are no precise attributes that make up a gem, other than the fact that it will eventually pump.</p>
<div>However, few criteria must be taken into consideration when analyzing potential gems; namely their market cap, volume, supply, and fundamentals.</div>
<div>Firstly, gems are generally coins or tokens with low market capitalizations since they haven’t hit the spotlight yet. Their trading volume usually increases over time as more people discover them. Moreover, they usually have scarcity mechanisms deployed such as a capped monetary supply like Bitcoin or a deflationary model. However, this isn’t a hard rule since several gems are also inflationary.</div>
<div>Fundamentals are the most important aspect of gem hunting, albeit the hardest as well. You need to know a project’s hidden value, which may require technical skills and financial experience to detect. Some of the questions you should ask when doing fundamental research and analysis are: “Is their product a game-changer?”, “What is this project’s unfair advantage?”, “how proficient is the team?”.</div>
<p>The top cryptocurrencies in the market today were once gems. When Bitcoin was first introduced to the public, very few people saw it for the gem that it was but those that did were immensely rewarded. However, you also need to tread lightly when gem hunting and never cut corners on your research. While some coins can go 100x in a few months, most of them drop to zero.</p>

<preview>The first block of data that is processed and validated to form a new blockchain, often referred to as block 0 or block 1.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Genesis Block?</h2>
<div>A genesis block refers to the first block in a blockchain and is usually hardcoded into its application’s software. A blockchain has multiple “blocks” (containing validated transactions and recorded activity data) linked together by a metaphorical chain. </div>
<p>Each “block” of a cryptoasset contains referential data for the previous one and derives its value/legitimacy from its predecessor. The genesis block, thus, refers to the first block (Block 0 or Block 1) of a new blockchain, to which all other subsequent blocks are attached. </p>
<div>A genesis block is unique as it is the only block in a blockchain that does not reference a predecessor block, and in almost all cases, the first mining rewards it unlocks are unspendable.</div>
<div>Genesis blocks have special significance, as they form the very foundation of a blockchain and often contain interesting stories or hidden meanings. For instance, Bitcoin’s genesis block contains the now-famous message &quot;The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&quot; — a reference to the deteriorating financial conditions of that time and the rationale for creating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin’s genesis block in 2009 contained 50 BTC. </div>
<div>The Bitcoin genesis block is very intriguing not just for its included message, but also due to the fact that the next block was timestamped nearly six days later (the average time is 10 minutes). The present hypothesis is that the catchy Times headline enticed Satoshi Nakamoto to release Bitcoin in public, but that he actually created the genesis block earlier and altered the timestamp accordingly. After testing his software from Jan. 3, 2009, Satoshi possibly deleted all the test blocks and used the genesis block for his mainnet launch.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Are Geotagged NFTs?</h2>
<p>Geotagged NFTs are the latest talk of the town. This concept attaches geographic coordinates to NFTs of several well-known street arts across the globe.</p>
<p>Geotagging is the process of adding precise global positioning metadata, including the exact coordinates (latitude and longitude) to digital goods (images, websites, etc.). It is one of the most common ways to embed location-specific data, allowing anyone to search for the item’s original location in concern easily.</p>
<div>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that can be bought and sold like any other property. However, they don’t have a tangible form. NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain and include a digital certificate of authenticity or verifiable digital token representing your asset ownership on that blockchain.</div>
<p>In the beginning, NFTs were limited to digital collectibles. However, with the introduction of geotagged NFTs, art collectors can now own more than just the 3D version of the art. Each NFT comes with a virtual 3D figure that shows an actual spray painting somewhere in the world. The figure contains a geotag that links NFT with their respective artworks. The owner of the NFT, therefore, owns and can resell the physical street art.</p>
<p>Geotagged NFTs are non-invasive. Artists can now sell their work without worrying about detaching the wall it was drawn on. Not only does it allow artists an easy and tech-centric way to monetize their art, but it also enables users to own street art anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>Geotagged NFTs represent ownership while keeping the beauty of the original art intact. By creating a digital replica of the actual art, artists can monetize their work. Likewise, art enthusiasts can own their favorite art pieces without any geographical constraint. </p>
<p>All geotagged NFTs are original, and each will contain unique geospatial metadata (latitude and longitude coordinates, altitude, and more). For instance, if there were supposed to be a geotagged NFT for the Statue of Liberty, the metadata for the actual statue would be 40.6892° N, 74.0445° W.</p>
<p>Geotagging NFTs are designed to cater to a growing trend among crypto users looking to combine more real-world data. It connects the physical and digital aspects of art while redefining ownership, benefitting both the artist and the NFT owner. While the owner has the authority to resell the NFT anytime, the artist is entitled to royalty every time the NFT ownership changes hands. </p>

<h2>What Is Geth?</h2>
<div>Geth is the command-line interface for one of the three main code components of the Ethereum blockchain. Go, a programming language developed by Google, is one of the languages used to build the Ethereum network, and Go Ethereum is the interface used to write, edit and manipulate the Go code for the blockchain. Aside from Go, the Ethereum blockchain and protocol are also heavily based on Python and C++</div>
<div>Geth is the easiest and most accessible way for a developer or investor to run a full Ethereum node. Because of the user-friendly interface, Geth allows developers to quickly create accounts and start editing and improving the Ethereum network code. As a completely open-source project, Geth allows developers to get to the very foundation of the Ethereum blockchain and work on bugs and possible improvements. All source codes for Ethereum are available in Github and developers have free access to them, as well as read and write permissions. Currently, there are more than 400 people who have contributed to the Ethereum blockchain code. Of course, some of them are more involved than others, so people like Jeffrey Wilcke and Péter Szilágyi who have written major portions of the code are considered top contributors. </div>
<p>Go Ethereum is a very important part of the successful operation of the Ethereum network. Because it provides the easiest way to run a full Ethereum node, a lot of node-operators rely on Geth to be able to perform their tasks as validators. Without the Geth interface, the Ethereum network might not have been as successful as it is at the moment. Running full nodes is an essential requirement for the blockchain to be successful and active. Node operators are the ones who validate transactions and make sending and receiving ETH possible. Without software like Geth operating a full Ethereum node might not have been as easy, or accessible. </p>
<div>Last but not least, as the official Etheruem network client, Geth is the safest way to be an active participant in the network. While there are public node providers, the security of your node is at risk with them. If you instead decide to run your own, private Ethereum node through Geth, both your information and the network as a whole are going to be better protected. With a private node, you will essentially have a copy of the whole Ethereum blockchain, against which you will verify transactions. This increases the level of security, as the more private nodes there are, the lesser the chance for successful malicious attempts. Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are innately secure because of the peer-to-peer type of system, where node operators participate in securing the network together. </div>

<file>github.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>GitHub is one of the most popular code hosting platforms, allowing developers to collaborate on various projects.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is GitHub?</h2>
<div>GitHub is the largest code hosting website globally. It is a go-to service for developers, where you can post code sequences that become available to the GitHub community. One of the main aims of GitHub is to promote collaborative work and allow developers to work simultaneously on a project from anywhere in the world. In 2012, Microsoft purchased GitHub as the company had started extensively using the platform to publish open-source projects like Windows Calculator and Visual Studio. GitHub is built on top of Git, a software that tracks changes in content. Git was developed by Linus Torvalds, who also worked on creating the Linux operating system. </div>
<p>GitHub is an extremely versatile tool that greatly boosts the productivity of developers worldwide. One of the main focuses during the development of GitHub was to facilitate an intuitive environment where developers can track changes along different versions of code-based projects. In order to provide flexibility to developers, GitHub is designed to support a wide array of different programming languages, file formats and features. The platform allows users to assign roles and editing privileges to other contributors. Additionally, GitHub lets developers ping each other with questions and participate in discussion boards, which also boosts the platform’s collaborative nature. </p>
<div>When it comes to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, GitHub is an essential service. Many of the most popular blockchain-based projects are published on GitHub, allowing developers from all over the world to contribute to their code. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stellar, Cardano and many other crypto projects are freely available on GitHub. In this sense, GitHub has been a great facilitator of the rise of the cryptocurrency industry. It allows contributors from all over the world to work collaboratively on blockchain developments. GitHub has also become a tool to evaluate interest in different projects — the more contributors there are on a project, the more interest it has garnered. </div>
<div>Unfortunately, the open-source nature of GitHub leaves projects prone to malicious attacks. Users have attempted to take advantage of GitHub’s servers to set up crypto mining operations essentially for free. This is a big concern for the platform, which is why GitHub’s creators have taken steps to prevent such instances. To ensure the integrity and protection of the platform, only registered users with an active GitHub account have editing rights on the website. While anyone who visits GitHub can read through code and projects, only registered users have the right to edit. This measure was taken in order to offer users and publishers an increased level of security for their projects. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Gold-Backed Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<div>A gold-backed cryptocurrency is a derivative digital asset whose value is supposedly underwritten by the equivalent price in gold. Each gold-backed cryptocurrency defines a single one of its tokens arbitrarily as having an equivalent worth of certain grams or troy ounces of gold, meaning that this equivalent should be present in the reserves/vaults of the company or a trusted custodian as physical collateralized assets. </div>
<div>Some gold-backed tokens even allow for the redemption of the tokens back for gold. Unlike most cryptocurrencies that have speculative value, a gold-backed token’s value is tied to a tangible asset, which cushions it against severe price fluctuations. The majority of gold-backed cryptocurrencies exist as ERC-20 standard tokens, although there are exceptions such as Paxos’ PAX Gold. </div>
<div>Blockchain-based digital assets backed by gold and other real-world scarce commodities are becoming increasingly appealing for investors looking to hedge their portfolios against weakening fiat currencies or regulation-bound stablecoins. </div>
<p>The biggest advantage that digital versions of gold hold over their physical counterparts is that they can be divided into any small unit or amount and transferred to another party. </p>
<p>Gold-backed cryptocurrencies have, however, historically struggled with systemic issues, such as:</p>

<title>Golden Cross</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/golden-cross</url>
<file>golden-cross.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Golden cross is a bullish technical trading indicator that signals an imminent price rise of the asset/stock/cryptocurrency.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Golden Cross?</h2>
<div>A golden cross is formed when a slow moving average is crossed by a faster one. The most popular moving average setting used by traders is the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average. </div>
<h2>How Is a Golden Cross in a Trading Chart Formed?</h2>
<div>In this setting, the faster-moving average has to cross the slower-moving average from below for a golden cross to be formed on the trading charts. Other examples of golden crosses can be seen in the combination setting of 5-day and 15-day averages, however, longer periods are more reliable and provide stronger signals of an asset/stock/cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>There are three major stages of a golden cross. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>Notice how the graph was moving in a horizontal direction when the purple line signifying the 200-day moving average was above the yellow line which is the 50-day moving average. When the yellow line crosses the purple one in the upward direction, a golden cross is formed and the price shoots up from there. </div>
<div>A golden cross is considered as the most definitive signal of a bull market and a strong buying signal for many traders, however, some only consider it to be a confirmation rather than a signal of entering the market. Experienced traders advise not to take the golden cross as a sole trading signal but see it as part of a system.</div>
<h2>Is the Golden Cross Indicator Reliable?</h2>
<div>There may be skepticism and difference of opinion among the financial analysts when it comes to the golden cross indicator; however, it has performed incredibly well in recent times. A great example of it would be the S&amp;P index which increased by more than 50% after the last golden cross appeared in its trading charts.</div>
<h2>What Is the Golden Cross Trading Strategy?</h2>
<div>The first trading strategy is safe and most popularly used which is to make an entry into the market when the golden cross is formed. However, some traders also enter the market as soon as the moving averages move in a direction to form the golden cross in order to gain the advantage of entering the market before the formation. </div>
<div>For short-term traders, it is advisable to use the 100-day moving average instead of the 200-day one. This strategy helps in shorter time frames, like 1-hour charts. </div>
<div>A lot of traders use the golden cross with a variety of technical indicators to understand the price and volume activity from different angles before making a buying/selling decision. These technical indicators include, but are not limited to moving average convergence divergence (MACD), on-balance volume (OBV), accumulation/distribution indicator, relative strength index (RSI), and the stochastic oscillator.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Google Authenticator?</h2>
<p>Google Authenticator is a software-based verification system that generates unique one-time codes that are time-based on your mobile phone.</p>
<h2>How Does Google Authenticator Work?</h2>
<div>Before delving into the process of how the software works, let's talk about an event that will help us explain why and how this application successfully protects its users. In mid-2019, Singapore-based Bitrue got hacked. About $5 million worth of XRP and ADA tokens were taken. The hack was fruitful on the grounds that the hacker accessed clients' login credentials. </div>
<div>Most of the digital asset exchange security procedures online involve providing the username and password to log in and take benefit of services. With the increase in the power of malware and hacking tools, it has become quite easy to extract these login credentials and steal your crypto tokens. What can be done to secure your account from hackers? That's where Google Authenticator comes into play.</div>
<div>When you attempt to log in, Google Authenticator essentially ensures the security of your account by requesting a code that is time-sensitive and can only be derived from the app installed on your phone. Therefore, even if the hacker has the login credentials, they will fail to access your account without having complete access to your phone. Here the concern of the SIM card getting hijacked also gets eliminated as Google Authenticator's two-factor authentication method makes sure that code is not stored on the SIM card. Moreover, its time-based nature eliminates other security concerns that users may have. </div>
<p>Google Authenticator helps verify a user’s identity to grant them the right of entry to websites and applications. It is a measure taken by multiple services to add an extra layer of security.</p>
<h2>How to Use Google Authenticator?</h2>
<p>Download and log into Google Authenticator’s app.</p>
<div>For example, you are binding your Binance account in this method. Click on the “+” sign and then select the “Scan a QR code” option. On your binance account, a QR code will be provided to bind your account with Google Authenticator. Just scan the code and Voila! </div>
<p>Just for the final confirmation, Binance may ask you to enter the six-digit code that will be generated changing every 15 seconds on your Google Authenticator app. Do it right away and now your account has been securely bound to the app! Make sure you save the setup key!</p>
<p>Whenever you login to your account by inputting your username and password, the website or app will ask you to input the six-digit code before allowing you to access the account.</p>
<h2>Importance of Google Authenticator for Crypto Investors</h2>
<div>When creating an account on a cryptocurrency exchange, it is important to set up Google 2FA to protect your crypto tokens. After numerous crypto hacks in the history of cryptocurrency, many exchanges have made this process mandatory. Not only does the applications make it necessary for a person to use multiple devices to regain access to an account, through its time-based code mechanism, it also makes sure that hackers don’t have enough time to crack two devices to gain access.</div>
<p>If you are an active trader with a substantial digital asset holding in your trading exchange account(s), it is strongly advisable to use Google Authenticator as an additional security layer.</p>

<title>Governance</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/governance</url>
<file>governance.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>In the world of cryptocurrencies, governance is defined as the people or organizations that have decision-making powers regarding the project.</preview>
<description>
<div>Governance is an important aspect of all cryptocurrency projects. As decentralized blockchains, cryptocurrencies often have a very liberal governance structure. There are a number of different approaches to governance. </div>
<div>On-chain governance is one of the primary structures for voting in blockchains. When a blockchain project has on-chain governance, the rules on who can participate in votes and make decisions are embedded in the chain itself. This means that all nodes in the blockchain network have to approve proposed changes and adopt them in the on-chain governance rules. Developers working on the project send out packages with proposed changes, and nodes have the option to either accept or reject these changes. In many aspects, on-chain governance is considered more in tune with the underlying decentralization of cryptocurrencies. As all nodes get the right to accept or decline a proposed improvement, decisions are made with everyone’s participation. Of course, there are also some concerns with the fact that this structure puts a lot of power in the miners’ hands. </div>
<div>Off-chain governance is the other main decision-making structure adopted by cryptocurrency projects. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both managed through off-chain governance. In this governance method, developers, miners, users and business supporters can participate in decision-making. Bitcoin, for example, has a set of code developers who work on the project. They communicate through various mailing lists and social media channels and accept or decline changes. Development proposals are gathered and reviewed by the core development team. However, these changes are not written out in the blockchain’s code, and validation by all miners and nodes is not necessary. In this sense, off-chain governance is more similar to traditional business governance and limits the level of decentralization in the project. </div>
<div>Many blockchain-based projects have introduced governance tokens to facilitate a more decentralized voting process. Governance tokens are purchased and staked in order for the stakeholder to gain voting rights and participate in the decision-making process regarding all aspects of the project. One of the most popular applications of governance tokens is in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These organizations do not have a centralized management system, but rather depend on a pool of stakeholders who are given voting rights. </div>
<p>Governance is an important part of all crypto projects, as it determines who has the right to participate in decision-making. Both governance models have advantages and disadvantages; however, on-chain voting rights distribution is becoming increasingly sought-after. </p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A governance token is a token that can be used to vote on decisions that influence an ecosystem.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Governance Token?</h2>
<p>Governance tokens are tokens that developers create to allow token holders to help shape the future of a protocol. Governance token holders can influence decisions concerning the project such as proposing or deciding on new feature proposals and even changing the governance system itself.</p>
<p>In many cases, the changes proposed, vetted and then voted on through on-chain governance accessed by using governance tokens are applied automatically due to smart contracts. In other cases, the team maintaining the project is tasked with applying the changes or hiring someone who will.</p>
<div>Proponents of systems that use governance tokens believe that they allow for user control, which holds true to the original cryptocurrency ideals of decentralization and democratization. In most cases, organizations who let users control the development of their systems are called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). </div>
<div>One well-known example of a governance token is Maker (MKR). This token allows its holders to vote on decisions pertaining to the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that the decentralized stablecoin DAI runs on.</div>
<p>For example, MKR holders can vote to change the complex economic rules that govern the decentralized lending that allows DAI to keep its price stable. At the time that the text you are reading was being written, MKR holders were voting on whether the protocol’s debt ceiling should be raised.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Greater Fool Theory?</h2>
<div>The greater fool theory was first discussed by professor Burton Malkiel where he said that as an investor, you can buy stocks or other investment assets that are clearly over-valued and still make money. This stems from his observation that due to biases in human behavior, people are generally drawn to assets whose prices are increasing. He posited that the effect is worsened due to herd mentality, where stories of immediate success by others are more likely to spur others to pursue similar gains. In short, the theory suggests that there is always a “greater fool” that you can sell the asset to.</div>
<h2>Greater Fool Theory Example</h2>
<div>Understanding this theory in the context of the digital assets market, we could see this in the rise of meme coins. So two of the most popular meme coins are probably Doge and Shiba Inu, where the existence of these coins has created multi-millionaires and billionaires. As more stories of people becoming millionaires come out, it attracts “greater fools” who irrationally believe that they can be the next millionaire. In some cases, these meme coins can even be outright scams, such as the “Squid Game” coin based on the popular South Korean Netflix drama.</div>

<title>Green Candle</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/green-candle</url>
<file>green-candle.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A green candle is an indication of the price closing higher than the opening price.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Green Candle?</h2>
<div>Candles are used in technical analysis to describe and predict the price movement of a security. A candle represents the open, close, low and high prices for a given time period. Candles also give insights into market sentiment for a given time period.</div>
<p>A green candle is also called an up candle or a white candle. The opposite of a green candle is a red or black candle, which signifies that the closing price is lower than the opening price.</p>
<p>For example, if a stock opens at $10 and closes at $20, then its candlestick will have a body of $10. The upper shadow (wick) will be at $20 and there will be no lower shadow (wick) because the low was $0.</p>
<p>The color of the candlestick doesn't mean anything on its own, but rather it depends upon how other candlesticks are colored in relation to it. For example, if one day you see a green candle and the next day you see a red candle, then you can infer that the market went down in value from one day to the next. However, if you see two green candles in a row, then it could mean that value went up today but not as much as yesterday.</p>
<div>Green candles are the foundation of a bull market. If you have been watching crypto for a while, you can see that most of the time price rallies occur when there is a series of green candles. However, not all green candles are created equal. There are various types of green candles and they each mean something different.</div>
<div>The first thing to look at is the size of the candle compared to the previous one. If it is bigger and higher than the previous candle, then this shows that bulls have taken control over bears and they are pushing the price higher. If this happens consecutively (i.e., we get a series of big green candles), then this usually means that a bull run has started in the market.</div>
<p>Another thing to look at is how much volume is behind the green candle. If there is very little volume behind the green candle, then this could mean that there might not be much support for it and it could just be a retracement movement before another leg down.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t take this as a piece of advice. There are a lot of other factors that go into consideration when you decide to invest in a cryptocurrency. </p>

<preview>As opposed to solo mining, group mining is when multiple people mine together.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Group Mining?</h2>
<div>Group mining refers to the practice of multiple people or entities pooling their computational resources to mine together. Miners do this to mine more profitably, share rewards and mitigate security risks. </div>
<div>In group mining, everyone pools their processing power (denoted in hash rate) and shares the block rewards whenever the mining pool successfully mines a block. A group mining member’s reward will be based on his/her contributed processing power relative to the rest of the miners in the group. </div>
<p>Normally, solving the mining puzzle before every other miner in the world is like winning a mini-lottery. Fortunately, group mining ensures that constant determinable rewards can be received by all miners. </p>
<div>There are various pools for different cryptocurrencies, with various payout rates, since the pool managers also take a certain percentage of the mined cryptocurrencies for maintaining the pool. </div>
<p>They are also classified by their reward types (frequency and nature), by whether they keep the transaction fees and distribute only block rewards, or if they allow merged mining where two cryptocurrencies with similar hash types can be mined simultaneously for greater profit.</p>

<h2>What Is a Gwei?</h2>
<div>Gwei is a small unit of the Ethereum network’s Ether (ETH) cryptocurrency. A gwei or gigawei is defined as 1,000,000,000 wei, the smallest base unit of Ether. One gwei equals 0.000000001 or 10-9 ETH. Conversely, 1 ETH represents 1 billion gwei! </div>
<p>Gwei is a useful denomination to calculate gas fees (paid to miners for transaction processing) in a convenient way. Gwei also has the nickname “shannon,” for Claude Shannon, a mathematician and cryptographer referred to as &quot;the father of information theory.&quot; </p>
<p>Ether (ETH) has other base units as well, each nicknamed after an important personality whose work has helped with the project in any way or form. </p>
<p>Here are a few:</p>
<p>1 wei (named for Wei Dai, a “godfather” of the crypto movement).</p>
<p>1 kwei (termed babbage after Charles Babbage) is equal to 10’3 wei. </p>
<p>1 mwei (termed lovelace after Ada Lovelace) is equal to 10’6 wei. </p>

<preview>Hacking is the process of using a computer to manipulate another computer or computer system in an unauthorized fashion.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Hacking?</h2>
<div>Hacking can be described as an act to compromise or manipulate computational devices or systems by finding weaknesses to test or exploit. Hacking is done for various purposes and ideological reasons, such as terrrorism funding, money laundering and sanctions evasion. For example, the notorious Lazarus Group, who has stolen billions in cryptocurrency, is believed to be a North Korean hacking unit. </div>
<p>There are different kinds of hacking, some of it for the greater good and others for more nefarious, criminal means:</p>
<p>“White hat hacking” seeks to improve security by finding and patching up vulnerabilities in systems, while “black hat hacking” seeks to attack systems for illicit purposes. The third kind is “grey hat hacking,” which also attacks systems through unconventional or unethical means, but isn’t meant for malicious purposes.</p>
<div>An example of a &quot;white hat&quot; hack in recent time is the $612 million hack of Poly Network, a cross-chain protocol. Few days after the heist, the white-hat hacker announced the return of the funds and branded himself &quot;an eternal legend.&quot;</div>
<div>A recent &quot;black hat&quot; heist is the $90 million hack from Japanese exchange Liquid, where funds were stolen from their warm wallets — a bridge between their internet-connected hot wallets and offline cold wallets.</div>
<div>Hacking has a particular importance in the study, design and exploitation of cryptocurrencies, since the basic premise of blockchain is to help users opt out of the traditional system and its assets.</div>
<div>Hackers have long devastated the crypto industry, stealing billions of dollars annually from exchanges, custodial services and wallet software users who keep their assets on “hot wallets” connected to the internet. </div>
<div>Some of the most notable hacks in crypto history are Mt. Gox (2014), Coincheck (2018) and Bitfinex (2019). Hackers often employ malicious spyware (malware) and viruses through phishing techniques to breach security systems or get users to unwittingly reveal their private crypto credentials.

<description>
<h2>Who Is Hal Finney?</h2>
<div>Hal Finney was a cryptographer and programmer who pioneered Bitcoin’s development and was the recipient of the first-ever BTC transaction. In 2009, Hal Finney had tweeted “Running bitcoin” a day before creator Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 BTC to his address. Additionally, Finney was the first developer to have used and made some improvements on the Bitcoin protocol besides Satoshi himself. </div>
<div>There are theories, which some people in the crypto community support, claiming that Finney might be the real Satoshi Nakamoto since a certain Dorian Nakamoto living nearby his area could probably have been the inspiration for the pseudonym. Finney’s writing had also been found to have the closest resemblance to Satoshi’s, according to analyst firm Juola &amp; Associates.</div>
<div>However, later on, after Finney revealed the email messages between him and Satoshi, as well as his BTC wallet, journalist Andy Greenberg accepted Finney’s denial of being the Bitcoin founder.</div>
<p>Additionally, Finney has also worked on the encryption software for PGP Corporation and the first “remailer” for Tor, a browser that offers multi-layered anonymity. Despite succumbing to ALS on Aug. 28, 2014, Finney’s works are still being praised to this day as he remains one of the most iconic and influential developers in the tech industry.</p>

<preview>An event in which the total rewards per confirmed block halves.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Halving?</h2>
<div>A halvening (or halving) is a deflationary blockchain event where block subsidies or rewards received for validating transactions decrease by half. It is significant in the sense that it reduces the rate of supply coming into circulation at every instant, and thus increases the scarcity by bringing fewer and fewer units of coins/tokens into existence. </div>
<div>These events are programmed directly into the code and made known in advance. For instance, Bitcoin rewards are programmed to decrease approximately every four years. Block rewards are currently 6.25 BTCs per block (900 BTCs daily), down from 12.5 BTCs (1800 BTCs) since 2Q20. The rewards will continue to decrease every four years like this, until the last Bitcoin is mined in approximately 2140. </div>
<div>Halvenings have the added benefit of making the emission schedule more predictable, as the circulating time can be estimated at any point in time. This can allow the determination of token valuation with accuracy. It’s a design feature of nearly all cryptocurrencies that are not pre-mined that the staking or mining rewards decrease over time. New projects are often designed to bring only the minimum viable supply required at launch into circulation, in order to increase its initial value..</div>
<p>Bitcoin’s 2020 halving was its third, following the mining reductions in 2016 and 2012. Each halving was followed by a strong price increase due to increased scarcity and a tightening of supply from miners. Other notable halvings include that of altcoins Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. </p>
<div>The next Bitcoin halvening is scheduled for March 2024 and will see mining rewards fall to a mere 3.125 BTC per block. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Hard Cap?</h2>
<div>A hard cap is the limit placed by a blockchain's code on the absolute maximum supply of a particular cryptocurrency, A hard cap doesn’t allow any further creation/circulation of its units. It is generally understood to be positive in nature as it creates scarcity, which drives up the value of each token. To bypass this limit, a cryptocurrency has to change its underlying parameters, essentially creating a new cryptocurrency.</div>
<div>A hard cap is a parameter, strictly monitored by the project’s community and crypto analytics websites. It can be altered by errors in the code (like the infamous Bitcoin 184M inflation bug, which broke the 21M limit before being fixed), as a fix by developers in extraordinary situations and also through malicious action (provision in code for extra minting for illicit gains and extraction of most value by gaining “extra tokens”).</div>
<div>‍In 2020,Yearn Finance’s YFI governance token shot up to over $40,000 in value largely due to its small hard cap of 30,000 tokens, while the MEME token, initially created as a piece of satire on the DeFi and non-fungible token (NFT) industry, exploded in value thanks to an airdrop and its even smaller cap of only 28,000 tokens.</div>

<h2>What Is a Hard Fork (Blockchain)?</h2>
<div>A hard fork is an event where a blockchain “splits” into two separate blockchains running parallel with each other, each with different parameters from a common previous chain. </div>
<div>The hard forking breaks the forward compatibility of crypto-assets. Therefore, even if the transaction history and parameters are the same before the hard fork, the history of both networks dissociates from one another after the event and any further activity beyond the fork will not reflect on the other. Hard forks can result accidentally from bugs/errors in the blockchain or be done intentionally (due to disagreements in the cryptocurrency community).</div>
<p>Hard forks are major events and are primarily broadcasted to a cryptocurrency’s community well in advance. They are the subject of major discussions and debates in the crypto community, as the community tries to find out the merit and drawbacks of modifying a particular characteristic of a project (mostly the block size, rewards and hard cap, etc.) </p>
<div>For instance, the proposal to hard fork Bitcoin in 2017 in order to increase its block size from 1 MB to 8 MB for faster and more transactions was met by strict opposition from the majority of the community. </div>
<div>As a result, a part of the community split and formed Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The cryptocurrency has had its own hard forks since, one that yielded Bitcoin Cash ABC (BTCA) and Bitcoin SV (BSV), and the latest 2020 fork that resulted in a new chain called Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) taking over the mantle from BTCA as the “official” BCH. </div>
<div>Ethereum, meanwhile, had a well-documented hardfork in 2016 following the DAO’s replay exploit which left the original chain to operate as Ethereum Classic. In 2020, Ethereum suffered an unexpected, but minor, hard fork after their developers didn’t properly relay unscheduled upgrades to their community and infrastructure providers, causing the likes of infrastructure provider Infura to run outdated and conflicting software.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Hard Fork Combinator?</h2>
<p>A hard fork combinator (first designed by IOHK) is a tool to combine protocols specifically on the Cardano blockchain after a hard fork has occurred.</p>
<h2>How Does a Hard Fork Occur?</h2>
<p>A hard fork normally occurs to implement upgrades to the blockchain. It requires multi-partner signatures and normally modifies certain parameters of the existing protocol. </p>
<p>The hard fork is a split of a blockchain into two different protocols that run parallel to each other, where the new blockchain loses track and history of the previous one. </p>
<div>Generally, hard forks cause some downtime on the blockchain, which disrupts the transactions and user experience. Another way is to implement a hard fork on the live blockchain, which may result in compromising blockchain integrity. For example, the Bitcoin hard fork in 2017 resulted in the splitting of the chain and the formation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This eventually affected the investor and trader interests. </div>
<p>However, IOHK came up with the support of a hard fork combinator, which solves both of these problems efficiently.</p>
<h2>What Is a Hard Fork Combinator (HFC)? </h2>
<p>A hard fork combinator is mainly used to merge pre and post-upgrade protocols after a hard fork so that the possibility of interruptions or restarts is removed.</p>
<p>When a hard fork takes place, it is virtually impossible for all the nodes to update to the new parameters and block headers at the same time without interruptions. Therefore, it becomes necessary to take the blockchain into downtime, which is disturbing for users. </p>
<p>As a solution to this dilemma, IOHK Foundation came up with the hard fork combinator (HFC) for the Cardano (ADA) blockchain that allows multiple protocols to appear as one ledger so all the nodes don’t have to update to the new blockchain at the same time.</p>
<p>Cardano upgraded from Byron (wallet-only protocols) to Shelley (proof-of-stake supported protocols) in July 2020 where the hard fork modified the features and overall utility of the blockchain. Having a total of more than 1 million wallets at that time, a poorly executed hard fork would have meant the death of Cardano and its funds. </p>
<p>However, the hard fork combinator was put to use for the first time, and on July 29, 2020, at 21:45 UTC, the transition from Byron to Shelley took place smoothly without any downtime or blunders. The users were informed but not restricted for usage and the hard fork took place in the background allowing the gradual transition of nodes with the passage of time. </p>
<p>The Cardano blockchain, to this date, combines Byron and Shelley blocks. In further upgrades too, the transitions will be supported by the hard fork combinator. </p>

<title>Hard Peg</title>

<file>hard-peg.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A hard peg is an exchange rate policy, where a currency is set at a fixed rate against another currency.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Hard Peg?</h2>
<p>Hard Peg is an exchange rate policy, where a currency is set at a fixed rate against another currency. </p>
<p>For example, the Chinese Yuan was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a fixed rate of 8.28 per dollar.</p>
<p>The fact that a currency's value is pegged to another currency or basket of currencies means that it will fluctuate against other currencies with the same ratio. A hard peg only allows for a certain amount of movement in relation to the pegged currency, creating what's called a band.</p>
<p>Currencies often start out with a fixed exchange rate, but in time they're allowed to float freely as market conditions dictate. That typically happens because the government no longer wants to maintain the peg due to economic or political reasons—or simply because it can't continue supporting it.</p>
<div>Tether is one example of a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar. It was first launched as RealCoin and later was renamed Tether. The Tether company claims that each unit of the token is backed by 1 US dollar held in reserve by Tether Limited, but this has been disputed.</div>
<p>An advantage of hard pegs is that they are simple and transparent: the supply of the cryptocurrency is fixed and known. This may make them easier to implement without breaking the anonymity of transactions.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of a hard peg is that it can be challenging to maintain a peg if people want to use their holdings as an actual currency rather than a commodity. For example, if too many people buy the currency, there won't be enough dollars held in reserve to back all issued Tethers.</p>
<p>If too many people sell their holdings for dollars, maintaining the peg would also become difficult.</p>
<p>Currency pegging is a practice in which countries fix the value of their currency to that of another country. Pegging generally happens where a lot of trade occurs, like in East Asia. It can also happen at the global level when a group of countries, such as the European Union, agree to peg their currencies with each other.</p>
<p>Tying a currency to the value of another country's currency can be advantageous in several ways:</p>
<div>1. Stability. By fixing its currency value, a country effectively locks in an exchange rate and eliminates uncertainty about fluctuations in its money supply. This is especially attractive for developing countries.</div>
<div>2. Effortless trade with other fixed-rate countries. If a country fixes its currency relative to another one, it doesn't have to worry about devaluing its own money if it wants to get better trade terms with the other country; it already has those terms by having fixed its currency with the other country's.</div>
<div>3. Lowering risk on capital investments and loans. By keeping exchange rates stable, countries eliminate the risk associated with fluctuating rates and make their money supplies more predictable for businesses looking to invest or borrow money in that country or region.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Hardware Wallet?</h2>
<div>A hardware wallet is a small device, which usually physically resembles a typical USB stick. It is specially designed to store cryptocurrencies. A hardware wallet works by initially creating an isolated space that stores both public and private keys in order to track a user’s digital wealth on particular blockchains. In other words, the hardware wallet does not truly store the real coins, but only provides access to them.</div>
<div>Hardware wallets are also loosely referred to as cold wallets or cold storages and are in direct contrast to hot wallets. </div>
<p>The advantages of this cold storage cryptocurrency wallet include providing native storage of private keys and offering more security from malicious codes. Private keys are crucial pieces of data that identify the real owner of stored assets and allow holders to send and transfer them at will.</p>
<div>A hardware wallet requires users to provide a secure pin, safeguard a seed phrase, and physically protect the wallet. Additionally, it helps not to keep all the funds on a single device.</div>
<p>A user-set PIN blocks unauthorized access to a wallet. However, a hardware wallet allows pin resets via a seed phrase, which is a list of words that needs to be memorized or securely saved by the user during the initial setup.</p>
<p>Apart from securely storing cryptocurrencies, cold storages allow users to sign outgoing transactions by simply touching the “Confirm” option. And even with their heavy security, they are easy to use since there are apps that facilitate the transfer of funds for users who are not tech-savvy.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular hardware wallets in use today include Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey, CoolWallet, NGrave, and SafePal Wallet, which have evolved to support multiple cryptocurrencies.</p>

<title>Hash</title>

<file>hash.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A hash is the output result of a hashing algorithm, which creates a unique, fixed-length string to encrypt and secure a certain selection of arbitrary data.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Hash?</h2>
<div>Hashing algorithms are essentially the backbone of all cybersecurity mechanisms. Data of arbitrary sizes can be easily encrypted and transformed into a fixed length, single hash string through hashing. Hash functions are extremely important in blockchain technology because they allow for the secure and quick processing of data and its input to the distributed ledger. </div>
<p>In addition, hashes are essential when using block explorers because they allow for the quick extraction of information regarding transactions and addresses. Hashing data is one of the most secure data transfer practices because none of the original information can be accessed without a hash key. </p>
<p>The hash and hash algorithm were created by Hans Peter Luhn around 1950. He started developing a machine that can quickly sort through both text and numbers, and thus the hash was born. While, at the time, there weren’t so many complex applications of this discovery, since then, the hash algorithm has become a cornerstone of advanced computing. Hans Peter Lunh was an innovator far ahead of his time, however, his inventions are now utilized in virtually any software available. While the term hash was not officially coined until Herbert Hellerman's “Digital Computer System Principles” was published, Hans Peter Lunh is considered the inventor of the technology. </p>
<p>There are numerous different types of hash functions, all focusing on various aspects of the hash algorithm. Fibonacci hashing is one of the more popular hash algorithms, and it involves multiples of the Fibonacci number. Other types of hashes include Zobrist hashing and various combinations between Fibonacci and Zobrist algorithms. </p>
<div>In blockchain technology, hashing is used to enhance the processing of transactions. While data about transactions can be of various lengths, all transactions are transformed into a fixed-length value through hashing. This value is then recorded in the blockchain and can be called back at any point in time. Because of hashing, transaction processing on the blockchain is faster and more secure. For example, all Bitcoin transactions are processed through the Secure Hashing Algorithm 256, which shortens the hash length to a fixed 256bits, or 32 bytes. Regardless of the size of the transaction, its has is always going to have a set length of 256 bits. </div>
<div>Hashing is vital for the proper function of blockchain projects, and especially cryptocurrencies. Without it, adding records to the blockchain at a high rate would not have been possible.</div>

<preview>A unit of measurement for the amount of computing power being consumed by the network to continuously operate.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Hash Power/Hash Rate?</h2>
<div>Hash power, or hash rate, are interchangeable terms used to describe the combined computational power of a specific cryptocurrency network or the power of an individual mining rig on that network.</div>
<div>The operation of any mineable cryptocurrency — for example, Bitcoin (BTC) — is maintained by its own network of miners: individuals and organizations that contribute the computational power of their mining rigs to process transactions and emit new coins. They do this via calculating cryptographic hashes — pseudorandom data strings that are used to prevent double spending and to ensure that new coins can’t be created out of thin air.</div>
<p>The hash rate of a mining rig is the number of hashes that it can calculate per second. The combined hash power of a cryptocurrency network is the sum of the hash rates of all mining rigs that are in operation at any given moment.</p>
<div>Different devices, such as CPUs, GPUs and ASICs have differing hash rates, depending on their sheer computational power, as well as how well-optimized they are for the specific task of processing a given hash function.</div>
<div>The hash rate of an individual device is a key metric for measuring the profitability of a mining setup as it determines the likelihood of finding a “good” hash that will produce a mining reward. </div>
<p>On the other hand, the overall hash rate of a cryptocurrency network is an indicator of that coin’s security: in order to hack the network for personal gain, the attackers need to overcome its total hash power — making the task nearly impossible at high enough hash rates.</p>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is an agreement between two parties that requires no trust between two users by offering special features to reduce risk.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Hashed Timelock Contract (HTLC)?</h2>
<div>A hashed timelock contract (HTLC) is a distinct feature in the form of a time-locked escrow that is mainly used while creating smart contracts which enable the creators to modify the payment channels.</div>
<p>In basic terms, it is an agreement in which the receipt must be confirmed by the receiver or the beneficiary before a preset date or deadline, and failing to do so will result in the receiver losing the ability to claim the payment. The receiver must acknowledge the payment before the deadline.</p>
<p>There are two main terms that you should know in a hashed timelock contract:</p>
<div>Timelock - It is a function that limits any transacting from the funds of the contract until the receiver affirms the payment before a pre-decided time. This is enabled using Bitcoin commands. If this is not done, the paying party can claim a refund.</div>
<p>Hashlocks - This is a passphrase to claim the funds. The recipient must input the correct phase to gain access to the funds.</p>
<p>The hashed timelock contract feature is used for safe transfers through bidirectional and routed channels, the contract functions without any trust from either party.</p>
<h2>How Does the Hashed Timelock Contract Work?</h2>
<p>The hashlocks and timelocks are the most pivotal and important components that come into play while settling the contract.</p>
<p>Firstly, the paying party generates a code or password phase and hashes the code. This is known as the hashlock phase which is the restricting mechanism. The hash is protected until the final transaction takes place.</p>
<p>Next, the timelock mechanism is used by setting a set of timelocks to restrict future transactions. One of the timelocks is called a Check Lock Time verify. This sets a base time to release and limit the funds. The next timelock is known as Check Sequence Verify, this timelock keeps a count of the number of locks created to aid with finalizing the transaction.</p>
<h2>Application of Hashed Timelock Contract</h2>
<div>HTLC is mainly used in the Bitcoin Lightning network to allow users to transact through interconnected channels. The main issue that users face in p2p transactions is trust. This is solved by using the Hashed Timelock Contract as it requires no level of trust from either party. This allows two users to transact without being directly connected with one another through a payment channel - a process known as network routing. HTLC enables other users to aid the transaction and the hashlock and timelock prevent other users from impeding the transaction.</div>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>The main problem that HTLC solves is the risk of transacting. The contract greatly reduces the counterparty risk through hashlock and timelock mechanisms. </p>
<p>Going by the name, these swaps are smart contracts that remove the need for any intermediaries or exchanges with the help of hashed timelock contracts.</p>
<p>With the help of the timelock mechanism, the contracts are settled on a pre-determined deadline which eliminates the chances of a delay in the settlement of the contracts.</p>

<preview>A hedge contract is a form of insurance that investors use to hedge against the risk of financial loss. Typically, a hedge is designed to protect against price fluctuations in the market.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Hedge Contract?</h2>
<p>A hedge is an investment position intended to offset potential losses or gains that may be incurred by a companion investment. In simple language, a hedge is used to &quot;hedge&quot; the initial investment risk.</p>
<div>Hedging is the practice of taking a position in one market to offset potential losses or gains in another market. It prevents significant losses by reducing the risk that an unexpected move will cause a loss greater than the original investment. It generally involves using derivatives (options, futures, and swaps) or synthetic instruments (forwards, futures and swaps). Hedges can also be used to protect against currency fluctuations and other risks. </div>
<p>A hedge contract is a type of derivative instrument similar to a forward contract, but with some important differences. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an agreed quantity of a particular commodity at a set price on a given date in the future that allows the purchaser to fix their costs for the product or service, which can be useful if the price of the commodity increases and may provide a significant financial advantage to the buyer.</p>
<p>Hedge contracts can be used as a form of insurance against adverse changes in prices. As a result, they are often used by businesses as part of their risk management strategy and by commodity producers like farmers who have substantial assets in the form of crops that may decrease significantly in value if there is a bad harvest.</p>
<p>Forward Contract. This is a hedging tool that involves the sale of a certain commodity, currency, or security at a specified price to be delivered on a set date. The purpose of this forward contract is to mitigate risk for both parties involved. For example, let's say you own some oil wells in California and you worry about the price of oil dropping before you can make your next shipment. You could purchase a forward contract that would ensure that you get $100 per barrel for your shipment, regardless of the market value when you ship it.</p>
<p>Futures Contract. A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a specific price at a specified time in the future or at an agreed-upon date in the future. The futures contract buyer is said to have taken a long position while the seller has taken a short position. This transaction aims to decrease risk by locking in the price before you actually need to buy or sell the commodity or financial instrument. Futures contracts are standardized, which allows them to be easily traded on exchanges. Both parties agree on the quality and quantity of what will be exchanged. Many commodities are traded on futures exchanges, such as agriculture, metals, and crude oil.</p>

<h2>What Is Honeyminer?</h2>
<div>Honeyminer is a cryptocurrency mining app available for download on multiple devices. It uses GPU and CPU power to mine the most profitable currencies, as the app can automatically switch from one coin to another coin at ten minute intervals. </div>
<div>Once the app has calculated which altcoins are most lucrative and have the lowest difficulty, Honeyminer can mine numerous coins. These various mined altcoins are then converted to Bitcoin. It’s important to note that Honeyminer is not an open-source platform, therefore all of its operations are not transparent to users. </div>
<p>Another goal of the app is to enable users to mine cryptocurrencies using their own personal computers – even laptops. This is done through participation in a dynamic mining pool, with users running the app when their computer's GPU isn't in use. The pool focuses on mining altcoins that are GPU-friendly. At the end of the session, Honeyminer sends the participant their earnings in equivalent Bitcoin directly to their wallets. </p>
<div>One of the main benefits of Honeyminer is its high level of security, as all of the rewards awaiting withdrawal are kept in safe cold storage. The app developers go even one step further and report suspicious log-ins to users. Users also have the opportunity to turn on two-factor verification (2FA) if they wish.</div>

<preview>A Hostage Byte Attack is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a user that stored its data on a malicious storage node and is asked to pay ransom to retrieve its data.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is a Hostage Byte Attack?</h2>
<div>A Hostage Byte Attack, also known as a ransomware attack, is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a user that stored its data on a malicious storage node. The storage node refuses to return the parts of the data to the user unless the user pays a ransom. </div>
<p>The attacker may also threaten to delete important files on the user’s device unless the user pays ransom or payment in cryptocurrency. This can be especially detrimental if the attacker is also deleting their own data, which would make it impossible to recover that data even if the ransom were paid. It is also possible for the attacker to encrypt the data and then delete it, thereby making recovery even more complex.</p>
<p>In the case of Storj, the bad actor targeted a specific type of storage node — nodes that were using the default configuration settings, which were unencrypted. The attacker created a malicious node that appeared to be benevolent (and thus attracted more victims) and then exploited it in order to download private data and blackmail users.</p>
<p>The Storj team quickly responded to the situation by releasing a patch that mitigated the attack. While this may not have been possible in every blockchain scenario, it highlights the importance of rapid response teams as well as regular upgrades and patches for vulnerable networks.</p>
<p>Hostage byte attacks are difficult to defend against because there is generally no way for object storage providers to know whether a file will ever be paid for until after it has been uploaded. Even if you have an automated mechanism for flagging accounts that upload large numbers of files and do not pay for them, by the time you have flagged these users, they could have already inflicted significant damage on your system.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent a hostage byte attack is through strong authentication mechanisms and access controls that limit what a user can do with their account based on their current balance. For example, if someone has used up 98% of their free trial quota, they should be blocked from uploading any more data until they pay for the service.</p>
<div>Storj is an open-source project that aims to offer a completely decentralized, secure, and efficient cloud storage service, while also fulfilling the need for a blockchain-based marketplace where users can share their extra hard drive space and bandwidth in exchange for crypto. Instead of relying on a centralized server, Storj uses a peer-to-peer network to store files securely. The encryption and decryption process is done by the client device, and only the encrypted files are sent to the Storj network.</div>
<p>The Storj protocol relies on blockchain technology to coordinate data among nodes. The blockchain ledger holds information such as file contracts, renter proofs, farmer proofs, and data transfer audit trails. This ensures that all transactions are transparent and fully traceable.</p>
<div>Storj is not a storage service provider; it is an open platform that provides developers with tools to build dApps on top of its network. So far, the most prominent dApp built on Storj is Tardigrade, a decentralized cloud object storage service that makes use of spare hard drive space left by its users.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A test used to determine whether or not an asset is a security.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Howey Test?</h2>
<div>The Howey Test is a test that is used by the U.S. government to determine whether or not an asset is a security. If an asset is a security according to the Howey Test, then it is subject to certain regulations that are related to disclosure and registration. All securities have to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC is one of the most prominent U.S. financial regulatory agencies. </div>
<p>The purpose of the Howey test is to determine if a transaction represents an investment contract for the particular item in question. If so, then it is considered a security and thus must be registered with the SEC. The way that the Howey Test works is that the SEC considers whether or not if when a person invests his or her money in a common enterprise, he or she is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. If the answer is yes, then the item is a security. </p>
<div>The Howey Test gets its name from the famous 1946 Supreme Court case, SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. In this court case, a citrus farm in Florida was selling investment contracts without registering them as securities with the SEC, claiming that they weren’t actually securities. The SEC won the court case and the Howey Test was set up to determine whether or not financial instruments are investment contracts, and are thus securities. </div>
<p>Currently, as the cryptocurrency industry grows, the Howey Test is being used more and more to determine whether crypto assets are securities or not. All tokens that are classified as securities through the Howey test have to be registered with the SEC.</p>

<title>Hyperinflation</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/hyperinflation</url>
<file>hyperinflation.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Hyperinflation is defined as unrestricted growth in prices for goods and services in an economy. It happens when resources become limited, such as gas or food.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Hyperinflation?</h2>
<div>Hyperinflation in an economy is defined as an unlimited increase in prices for goods and services. In contrast to inflation, hyperinflation is a rare occurrence in an economy. It has, however, occurred in the past in different countries such as China, Germany, and Zimbabwe, to mention a few.</div>
<h2>What Causes Hyperinflation and How Can It Be Prevented?</h2>
<p>Hyperinflation is a sort of fast inflation in which prices can jump by 50% or more in a month. It is also known as &quot;permanent inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>It may be seen in cases where a government prints additional money to pay off different obligations and costs, despite the fact that it is regarded unusual. </p>
<p>To determine what causes hyperinflation, we must look at the two most common drivers of inflation: a rise in the money supply and a demand-pull imbalance.</p>
<p>In many circumstances, they collaborate to produce the ideal economic storm.</p>
<p>The government will print extra money to meet increased expenditures in order to pay for its high quantity of spending. This may occur in times of distress as a means of assisting citizens.</p>
<p>The issue with this strategy is that printing additional money has its own set of effects. Prices rise as the money supply expands, and inflation is born!</p>
<p>The more money that is pushed into an economy, the closer it gets to hyperinflation. This is risky since it might lead to currency depreciation.</p>
<p>A demand-pull imbalance within an economy is another source of inflation.</p>
<p>Demand pull happens when rising consumer demand for certain products and services surpasses the existing supply of those goods and services. When the increase in demand is paired with the scarcity of these products and services, market prices rise.</p>
<p>In developing economies, demand-pull inflation is prevalent.</p>
<h2>Impact of Hyperinflation</h2>
<p>The depreciation of the US dollar is one of the most noticeable symptoms of hyperinflation. The US dollar has lost approximately 96% of its value since 1935. In addition, the US currency has depreciated by 12% in 2020 when compared to a group of other nations.</p>
<p>This drop in the dollar's purchasing power has an impact on people all across the world, not just Americans. It has an impact on everyone. China did not depreciate its currency to match the US dollar for the first time in a long time, signaling that it may be reducing its reliance on the US market.</p>
<p>People in the United States may hoard money to avoid having to pay more if resources become scarce and prices rise as a result of hyperinflation. If not addressed, this trend has the potential to destabilize the economy.</p>
<p>While it may appear that discovering ways to save money is beneficial, the fact is that hyperinflation renders cash savings useless. As a result, you may need to rethink your retirement plans in order to understand how inflation may affect your retirement.</p>
<p>You'll need to account for inflation when calculating how much money you'll need to save before retiring. You need to construct a more thorough strategy for your financial future once you know how much money inflation is taking from you. The solution to all of these problems, however, is not to print more money. The more money the government injects into the economy, the more fuel for hyperinflation will be available.</p>
<h2>Popular Examples of Hyperinflation in the Past</h2>
<p>Following World War I, the Weimar Republic in Germany faced hyperinflation in the 1920s.</p>
<p>The bank released about 92 quintillion Deutsche Marks (the German currency) to combat rising inflation rates. This strategy worked until Germany was burdened with reparations from the Allies at the conclusion of the war. Production halted as a result of the extra 132 billion in debt, resulting in food shortages and higher prices to compensate. Every day, the rate of inflation climbed to about 21%.</p>
<p>Between 2013 and 2018, this was the most recent instance of hyperinflation. The Venezuelan bolivar became a weak form of money as a result of efforts to promote a new cryptocurrency. The country was also over $100 billion in debt.</p>
<p>As a result, employment rates plummeted and nearly matched those of the Great Depression in the United States. The rate of inflation in 2018 was 65,000%. In 2021, the country is still experiencing hyperinflation.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Hyperledger (Hyperledger Foundation)?</h2>
<p>Hyperledger is an umbrella project of open source blockchains and blockchain-related tools started by the Linux Foundation in 2015 to support the collaborative development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Initially, the Hyperledger Foundation only included two main projects - Hyperledger Fabric, a codebase combining work by Digital Asset, libconsensus from Blockstream and OpenBlockchain from IBM; and Hyperledger Sawtooth, developed at Intel’s incubation group. At the moment, however, the Hyperledger Foundation is the fastest developing project Linux has launched. </p>
<p>Through a rich collection of different stable frameworks, tools, and libraries for enterprise-grade blockchain deployments, Hyperledger aims to push the mass enterprise adoption of blockchain technology. </p>
<div>While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherum rely on permissionless blockchains, the Hyperledger Foundation focuses on creating permissioned enterprise blockchains. What this means is that the blockchains are operated in a private network where participants have an intrinsic benefit of complying with the consensus rules. </div>
<p>With the launch of the Hyperledger, the Linux Foundation set out five main goals for the project. One of the biggest missions of the project is to create an intuitive, blockchain-based ecosystem for enterprises to communicate internally and between each other. Another important goal for the Hyperledger Foundation is to push educational materials and events in order to showcase the numerous market opportunities for blockchain technology. Because of the innate characteristics of blockchains, the Hyperledger foundation also aims to create a neutral, open, and community-driven infrastructure for businesses. Last but not least, the foundation is striving to promote and build a strong community spirit to help with the further development of blockchain technology in the enterprise field. </p>
<p>The Hyperledger Foundation has successfully developed numerous real-life use cases and applications for blockchain technology throughout its work and partnerships. Spanning from financial services through supply chain management to healthcare, one of the foundation’s main goals is to introduce blockchain technology to as many industries as possible. </p>
<p>With enterprise partners like IBM, Walmart, Honeywell, Fujitsu, and Intel, the Hyperledger Foundation is one of the best-recognized blockchain ecosystems globally. As interest in blockchain technology rises exponentially, the foundation is expanding its reach to new industries and various new use cases. </p>

<title>Immutable</title>

<file>immutable.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A property that defines the inability to be changed, especially over time.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Immutable?</h2>
<div>Immutability is the core defining feature of blockchain. The word 'immutable' means that data cannot be changed or modified by anyone after its creation.</div>
<div>In a blockchain network, there is a need for immutability because all the nodes have to agree on the validity of the data before passing it on. The whole point of using a blockchain as a distributed ledger technology (DLT) is to ensure that no individual entity can make changes to records once they are added to the blockchain.</div>
<p>It's the ability to record transactions such as contracts, sales, purchases, etc., in such a way that once they are added, the data in those records cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network.</p>
<h2>How Blockchain Is Made Immutable?</h2>
<p>Cryptographic hashing is what makes blockchain immutable.</p>
<p>Hashing is an encryption technique that takes plaintext input of any length and produces a unique hash value. Hashes are always of a fixed length, regardless of the properties of the input they are based on.</p>
<p>The hashing algorithm is very simple, yet surprisingly difficult to reverse. For example, if you applied the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to the phrase &quot;the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;, it would return a 256-bit (32 characters) hexadecimal number like &quot;9e107d9d372a5dcea0c3f78f5340d8d4&quot;. If you were to apply this algorithm to any other string of text (for example, your password), you will always get the same output (a 32 character hexadecimal number).</p>
<p>The hash can be used as a digital signature for data integrity purposes. </p>
<div>When we send some data over the network, we can use its hash value as a fingerprint. If we receive the same data we can compute its hash and verify if it's equal to our original fingerprint. If not, we know that someone tampered with our data while it was in transit.</div>
<p>It’s important to note that immutability doesn’t guarantee that data can’t be altered. Its purpose is to merely ensure that no data or record on a blockchain can be altered without consequences.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Immutability </h2>
<p>The benefits of immutability are related to security, data integrity, easy auditing, and fraud prevention on blockchains. </p>
<p>In a traditional database system, if someone gains access to the data, they can corrupt or destroy it. In a blockchain, any changes to data require that all nodes on the network adopt the change. This is why there is no risk of data loss in a blockchain and why it is considered immutable. </p>
<p>Blockchain immutability ensures the protection of data integrity. The integrity of a chain can be validated simply by re-calculating the hashes value. Any discrepancy between the block data and its corresponding hash value indicates invalid transactions. </p>
<p>Because of immutability, an organization can produce an indisputable ledger, which prevents them from facing complications during an audit. </p>
<p>Thanks to cryptographic hashing, blockchain is immutable. Any changes or alterations made to a chain will disrupt the whole network. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Impermanent Loss?</h2>
<p>Impermanent loss describes the temporary loss of funds occasionally experienced by liquidity providers because of volatility in a trading pair.</p>
<p>This also illustrates how much more money someone would have had if they simply held onto their assets instead of providing liquidity.</p>
<div>Liquidity pools often feature two assets — and while one might be a stablecoin such as DAI, the other could be a more volatile cryptocurrency such as ETH.</div>
<div>Let’s imagine that a provider needs to offer equal levels of liquidity in both DAI and ETH — but suddenly, the price of ETH goes up.</div>
<div>This creates an irresistible opportunity for arbitrage, because the price of ETH in the liquidity pool now doesn’t reflect what’s going on in the real world. To ensure the ratio of DAI to ETH remains balanced, other traders will buy ETH at a discounted rate until there’s equilibrium again.</div>
<p>After arbitrage, a liquidity provider may end up with a greater amount of DAI and slightly less ETH. Impairment loss assesses the current value of their assets against what they would be worth if left sitting pretty in an exchange.</p>
<p>The loss only becomes permanent if a provider decides to withdraw their liquidity for good.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is In-the-Money / Out-of-the-Money?</h2>
<div>In traditional investing on the stock market, options trading is one of the most often used tools that allow traders to bet on positions relating to the price of a stock. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, many exchanges have started options trading for tokens as well. </div>
<p>In-the-money (ITM) and out-of-the-money (OTM) are terms used to describe the type of position a trader takes in terms of the current price of an asset or cryptocurrency. Options trading allows investors to bet on the future price of an asset and consequently take profit if their prediction was correct. </p>
<p>The ITM options trading mechanism is used when an investor bets money on a price that the asset has already surpassed. This type of options trading is usually used when a trader wants to hedge their funds against a position. One of the key benefits of ITM option trades is that they carry both time value and intrinsic value. This means that ITM options usually witness smaller price fluctuations, making them less risky investments. There are several trading tools that allow investors to place ITM options like puts and calls. </p>
<p>OTM option trades are relatively similar to ITM ones; however, the investor bets on a price that the asset or token has not yet reached. In this sense, OTM investments only have a time value to them, as the asset has not yet reached the price the investor places an option on. Because of the lack of intrinsic value, OTM options are usually cheaper than ITM options. OTM options are generally a preferred choice for investors who have strong reason to believe that an asset’s price will increase in the future. </p>
<div>Options trading is becoming an increasingly sought-after opportunity for cryptocurrency traders. Because of the highly volatile nature of crypto projects and the large fluctuations in price, options trading can be extremely profitable. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum go through significant volatility, which makes them a perfect asset for options trading. </div>
<p>While cryptocurrency trading is significantly different from trading on the traditional stock market, some principles and trading tools apply to both markets. ITM and OTM are two of the most important mechanisms in the trading world, and this is why they have also been introduced in cryptocurrency trading. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Infinite Approval?</h2>
<p>Infinite approval is a smart contract programming practice, often considered to be problematic. This programming feature sees a given smart contract require authorization to access an unlimited number of tokens from the user’s wallet instead of only the number that is actually needed.</p>
<p>An infamous example of a smart contract that was programmed this way is one employed by decentralized exchange Bancor. When a user first used the system, he had to give the smart contract an authorization to withdraw an unlimited number of tokens from his wallet.</p>
<p>Bancor’s smart contracts also contained a vulnerability that could have allowed a hacker to steal all the units of the token that the user authorized the contract to manage by leveraging this vulnerability. Fortunately, Bancor’s programmers noticed before malicious actors could steal the tokens and later modified their systems to only ask for approval for the needed number of tokens. The developers preemptively “stole” user funds to return them later to avoid a hack.</p>
<p>After the controversy surrounding Bancor, it surfaced that infinite approval is a very popular practice among decentralized application programmers. Research conducted by a researcher at crypto wallet ZenGo revealed that popular decentralized applications Compound, Uniswap, bZX, Aave, Kyber and dYdX all feature infinite or extremely large approvals.</p>
<div>For instance, a liquidity provider may provide a liquidity pool with $5,000 worth of Ether and $5,000 of USD-pegged decentralized stablecoin DAI to allow trading back and forth between the two. This way, every time a trade on the ETH/DAI is executed, the liquidity provider would receive compensation for having funded the pool in question.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Infinite Mint Attack?</h2>
<div>An infinite mint attack occurs when an unwanted entity or hacker mints an absurd amount of tokens within a protocol, increasing its supply to an unhealthy amount, which debases the value of each token. Attackers would often proceed to dump all the minted tokens on the market and cause the price to crash. The process typically unfolds swiftly, with attackers taking home millions of dollars worth of tokens.</div>
<div>Blockchain systems are vulnerable to this type of attack mainly because of security lapses, which allow hackers to exploit bugs and other code vulnerabilities. In the Cover Protocol attack, hackers exploited shield mining contracts, which enabled them to gain unauthorized crypto rewards from the protocol.</div>
<div>The hacker managed to exploit 40 quintillion tokens on the Cover staking pool, causing its token price to plummet by 97%. In this case, the attacker liquidated more than 11,700 coins via 1inch and stole around $5 million worth of tokens. </div>
<p>The best prevention for infinite mint attacks is a series of smart contract audits from various firms. However, audits do not guarantee that a protocol is completely secure.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Initial Bounty Offering (IBO)?</h2>
<div>Whereas initial coin offerings require people to purchase tokens using fiat, initial bounty offerings result in people being rewarded with free or discounted tokens in exchange for their services.</div>
<p>Enthusiasts who dedicate their time and skill to further a project — by completing tasks related to translation, marketing, business development or human resources — can be eligible in an IBO. </p>
<p>This can mean that they’re emotionally invested in a project and more determined to see it succeed, and this approach can be more effective in building a community.</p>
<p>As a result, IBOs require more mental commitment from the receiver.</p>
<p>Those who receive tokens can cash them out at a later stage once they are listed on an exchange, or they can hold on to them in the hope that their value grows.</p>
<p>Upon completion of an ICO, bounty programs may be utilized to obtain feedback on a cryptocurrency project’s code or to compensate for efforts for promoting the coin.</p>
<div>Coders who are able to identify flaws in the blockchain may also be given rewards in the form of bug bounties, and these rewards can run into many thousands of dollars.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Short for Initial Coin Offering, an ICO is a type of crowdfunding, or crowdsale, using cryptocurrencies as a means of raising capital for early-stage companies.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)?</h2>
<div>Any cryptocurrency or blockchain company looking to raise funds to create an app, service or new coin can use an ICO to raise funds.</div>
<p>It is widely seen as the cryptocurrency world’s answer to initial public offerings (IPOs) — and they were especially popular during the crypto bubble of 2017.</p>
<div>Since then, ICOs have come under fire amid concerns that they can be used by scammers and market manipulators. Some projects have also faced action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because they were deemed to be unregistered securities sales.</div>
<div>An ICO usually begins with a company launching a whitepaper detailing the project’s goals, how many tokens will be mined, and how they will be distributed. In some cases, investors will be given reduced prices if they purchase tokens early on in a campaign — and it can also be possible to receive discounts if cryptocurrencies are used for a purchase instead of fiat.</div>
<p>Tokens sold through an ICO may offer utility, meaning that the owner can exchange them for access to a certain product or service. In rare cases, they may represent an ownership stake in the start-up that launched the listing.</p>
<p>ICOs have hit headlines in recent years for being very risky investments, and some of them have even been identified as exit scams.</p>
<p>Research by the Review of Financial Studies shows ICOs raked almost $13 billion globally between January 2016 and August 2019. Meanwhile, a report by Ernst &amp; Young found that 86% of leading ICOs that launched in 2017 were below their listing price by October 2018.</p>
<div>Key criticisms of ICOs revolve around the ease by which an ICO can be launched without regulatory oversight — meaning that they often draw in inexperienced investors. Owing to their image problem, initial exchange offerings and security token offerings have become much more popular alternatives in recent years.</div>
<p>The SEC has been known to take action against some projects — including Telegram, which was ordered to return a large sum of the $1.7 billion it raised for the Telegram Open Network back to investors.</p>
<p>In March 2020, under a preliminary injunction issued by the District Court for the Southern District Court of New York, Telegram had to return $1.2 billion to investors on top of a civil penalty worth $18.5 million.</p>

<preview>An initial dex offering (IDX) is an alternative to an initial coin offering (ICO).</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Initial Dex Offering?</h2>
<p>Initial dex offerings, or IDOs, are tokens that represent any type of asset hosted on a decentralized exchange (DEX) — an IDO is when a project launches a token through a decentralized liquidity exchange. IDOs can be created for anything from cryptocurrency to a music album, to aether powered battle ships. IDOs offer businesses a tool for engaging their communities in an economy that both enriches their products and services while allowing them to make smart business decisions regarding their assets.</p>
<div>In the same way that traditional startups receive venture capital before launching, projects issuing initial DEX offerings receive financing from individual investors. Unlike an initial public offering, investors in initial dex offerings never own any equity in the project.</div>
<div>IDOs have some benefits that may make them more attractive than ICOs and IEOs: immediate liquidity, immediate trading and lower costs for listing.</div>
<div>‍An initial DEX offering or IDO refers to the launching of a cryptocurrency on a decentralized exchange (DEX). In an IDO, a blockchain project makes a coin’s first public debut on a DEX in order to raise funding from retail investors. IDOs have similarities with initial exchange offerings (IEOs), where crypto projects launch their token and raise funds via a centralized exchange, since both allow immediate trading on top of raising funds. However, centralized exchanges impose strict ground rules including:</div>
<div>IDOs, on the other hand, can offer a far more cost-effective token sale and listing model. Firstly, an IDO provides quick liquidity with little to no slippage through available liquidity pools in a DEX. Relatively, it has cheaper listing costs. And like IEOs, it allows instantaneous trading.</div>
<div>Examples of DEXs that offer IDO services include Binance DEX, Polkastarter and Uniswap. Most traders also prefer IDOs over ICOs since IDO listings prevent the issuer of the tokens from controlling how the fundraising round will go. One of the first IDOs launched in the space was RAVEN, which was listed in Binance DEX in June 2019.</div>

<div>Initial exchange offerings are fundraising events where crypto start-ups raise money through a trading platform. This is in contrast to an initial coin offering, where the business itself will attempt to generate interest in its project on its own website.</div>
<p>China banned ICOs at the end of 2017, and left the crypto world scrambling to find other solutions to fund new businesses.</p>
<div>IEOs take place on a crypto exchange on behalf of the company that is launching new tokens.</div>
<p>Start-ups are charged a fee, as well as a certain proportion of tokens sold, in order to fundraise on the exchange.</p>
<p>The tokens are then listed on the exchange upon completion of the IEO — helping to raise the company’s profile in the eyes of investors.</p>
<div>Unlike ICOs, where contributions are sent to smart contracts, participants send contributions through the platform that hosts the IEO.</div>
<p>IEOs have risen in popularity among key cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>Binance Launchpad was one of the first few IEO platforms to be launched in the industry, with many rival exchanges quickly following suit.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of IEOs is increased transparency and trust.</p>
<p>As the token sale is conducted by a regulated cryptocurrency exchange, the chances of fraudulent activity and scams are less likely than through ICOs — with reputable platforms performing their own due diligence into a project before offering it to users.</p>
<p>Token issuers are not tasked with managing the crowdsale security under an IEO, and they can also benefit from the exchange’s extensive client base to solicit greater investor interest.</p>
<div>Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering processes are also conducted by the exchange rather than by the token issuer — and they’ll often get assistance when it comes to marketing their businesses.</div>
<p>Although deemed more credible than ICOs, IEOs can involve high costs for start-ups in return for increased safety and visibility.</p>

<title>Initial Farm Offering (IFO)</title>

<preview>Initial Farm Offering (IFO) helps DeFi projects raise capital through the farming feature offered by decentralized exchanges.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Initial Farm Offering (IFO)?</h2>
<div>Initial Farm Offering (IFO) is a fundraising model that helps new DeFi projects raise capital by participating in pre-sales events hosted after stern project vetting by decentralized exchanges.</div>
<div>IFO is a successor of the initial coin offering (ICO), a crowdsourcing method used by cryptocurrency projects to raise funds in the early stages. </div>
<p>Investors can participate in a pre-sale event that is hosted by the DEX, raising the capital necessary for available projects by investing in native tokens. DEX teams usually prepare a proposed list of the most lucrative projects to launch in the farming event. However, it is worth considering that the tokens acquired via IFO have no clear advantage over those raised through other fundraising models. Despite proper scrutiny by the DEX teams, the value of the token can be affected by the market sentiments.</p>
<div>The most common platform for IFO is PancakeSwap, the users of which can benefit directly from the fundraising. These users are entitled to rewards while the owners of new projects can benefit from the liquidity pool offered by the platform. Most of these tokens are community-driven with little to no control by a specific central authority.</div>
<p>There are two common types of IFO events:</p>
<div>Unlimited Sale: By paying a predetermined fee, the user can stake as many BNB and CAKE tokens as they can.</div>
<div>Basic Sale: A defined number of tokens can be staked and the users are not charged a participation fee.</div>
<p>To be part of an IFO, the first step is to set up an account on any of the DEXs that support this feature. Users then stake CAKE or BNB tokens (according to the participation terms) to take part in the IFO. They must provide liquidity for the farming process. By the end of the process, those users are rewarded with such tokens.</p>
<p>The following are some benefits that could be enjoyed by IFO users:</p>
<p>Elimination of the middle-man. Peer-to-peer transactions are stimulated on the IFO platform, allowing users to save money in the long run even if they are novices in the world of crypto.</p>
<p>IFO maximizes the benefits of trading on DEXs, especially for those who are new to crypto. </p>
<p>Project fundraising is safe via IFO platforms because of the dual-margin intention.</p>
<p>The decentralization keeps all the transactions and activity transparent for users and investors.</p>
<p>Like all other fundraising events, it is better that each user research the one that suits them the best. However, do your own research properly before investing in any token and keep the factor of volatility in mind. The preceding fundraising models, especially ICO, were heavily reliant on VCs, which meant greater time consumption and unreliable gains. However, being relatively new in comparison to ICO and IEO, some users might not be confident about opting for IFO — but the trend of DeFi may tilt the focus of the market towards IFOs.</p>

<title>Initial Game Offering (IGO)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-game-offering-igo</url>
<file>initial-game-offering-igo.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Initial game offerings (IGOs) provide individuals with an opportunity to invest in gaming projects at an early stage that have the potential to offer huge returns after their launch.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Initial Game Offering (IGO)?</h2>
<div>Initial Game Offering (IGO) launchpads are the latest trend in the crypto world and the concept is similar to Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The only difference is that in IGOs, the platform hosts gaming projects that are based on NFTs or tokens as their in-game currency and rewards. </div>
<div>Investors can put their funds into the gaming projects offered by IGO launchpads and expect significant ROI once that gaming project is launched on major crypto exchanges or gains popularity in the ever-increasing gaming community.</div>
<div>With the rise of blockchain gaming, IGOs are becoming the next big thing in the crypto space. Games like Axie Infinity (AXS), CryptoBlades (SKILL), and Alien Worlds (TLM) have thousands of daily active users. Axie Infinity is currently leading the pack with over $1.1 billion USD in sales so far in 2021. While Axie Infinity has launched its initial token sale of $AXS on the Binance launchpad, players in the game earn income primarily from its Smooth Love Potion ($SLP) token. $SLP are obtained by completing daily quests, competing with other players (PvP) and battling monsters in adventure mode (PvE). Players can trade $SLP to fiat on exchanges like Binance, and users in the Philippines can check the SLP exchange rate to PHP directly on CoinMarketCap.</div>
<div>Owing to this huge popularity, several IGO launchpads have surfaced, including Gamefi (GAFI), Enjinstarter (ENJINSTARTER), Gamestarter (GAME), Seedify.fund (SFUND), and others. </div>
<div>GameFi is one of the first launchpads to feature the concept of initial game offerings (IGO). Currently, there are two IGOs live on GameFi platform, namely $KABY Pool and Deathroad IGO. Both games are offering their initial tokens to gamers who can either store them and wait for the price to go up or use the tokens to enhance their blockchain game-oriented experience.</div>
<div>Enjinstarter is another IGO launchpad that offers unique projects and features that include yield farms, NFTs-based platforms and DeFi platforms. The project is built on Enjin's Jumpnet, a platform for game developers to build communities and run marketing campaigns to boost gaming projects.</div>
<div>The main purpose behind offering IGOs is to provide early access to gaming assets that early investors can bank on and expect a significant return on investment in the future. </div>
<div>IGOs may seem a good investment, however, before investing in any IGO platform or projects that are in its initial game offering (IGO) phase, a few things should be considered:</div>
<p>In summary, investing in IGOs and IGO launchpads is like any other investment decision. You have to evaluate whether the IGO launchpad has a good standing and aims to provide support for major gaming projects in the future.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Initial NFT Offering (INO)?</h2>
<div>After ICO, IEO and IDO, Initial NFT Offering (INO) is a new cryptocurrency crowdfunding mechanism based on the same concept fundamentals that involve offering a set of limited NFTs for sale. </div>
<div>Companies and individuals have been using ICOs as a way to raise capital or participate in investment opportunities since 2013. From the genius of ICO, there comes the rise of other crypto fundraising mechanisms, namely STO (Security Token Offering), IEO and IDO. </div>
<p>NFTs are experiencing a massive adoption as lots of prominent musicians, artists, athletes, commercial brands and crypto enthusiasts are participating in the NFT market. INOs have risen in popularity with the NFT hype, something that benefits both content creators and investors. </p>
<p>INO involves offering a set of NFTs on launchpads or marketplaces for sale to public investors. </p>
<p>Some key benefits include:</p>
<p>Entry barriers of INOs are lower than launching fungible tokens. This enables projects with big and small ideas to be recognized by a wider range of audiences. They can raise the needed funds with cheaper listing costs and easier access to instant liquidity before the project is ready. </p>
<p>NFTs promote a strong sense of community as owning one of a verifiably scarce NFT of a collection puts holders into a close circle. Ownership of a limited-edition NFT makes it easier to recognize each holder compared to owning a small percentage of a fungible token supply.</p>
<p>Each NFT can only be owned by one wallet address. NFTs contain built-in ownership verification that serves as proof of ownership. Each holder becomes an advocate of the project since most perceive NFT ownership as a ‘bragging right’, especially when used as PFPs (profile pictures).</p>

Only1 helps creators monetize and allows fans to connect with the creators they love in a unique way, similar to a decentralized Patreon.

<title>Initial Public Offering (IPO)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/initial-public-offering-ipo</url>
<file>initial-public-offering-ipo.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An initial public offering (IPO) is the process of a company offering shares for purchase on the stock market for the first time.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an IPO?</h2>
<p>An initial public offering (IPO), also known as an initial purchase offering, is one of the most important milestones in a company’s development. The IPO is the moment when a company becomes publicly available on a stock exchange, and traders can purchase shares of the business. Going public on the stock market is one of the best ways for companies to raise capital and boost their performance. This is also a significant milestone noting the successful growth of a company to the point where its work is of interest to public investors. </p>
<div>IPOs are a big opportunity for companies, which is why a lot of new companies and start-ups are looking to go public. While the benefits are undeniable, a company can announce an IPO only after successfully completing a rigorous check from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Before announcing an IPO, companies are considered private, which limits the number of investors that can contribute to the company and own shares. While staying private is beneficial for smaller companies that do not want to be exposed to increased risk, IPOs are extremely beneficial for growing businesses. Traditionally, a company should have reached a private valuation of about one billion dollars before considering an IPO.</div>
<p>One of the most important aspects of an IPO is shares valuation. Before a company can go public, it needs to go through a rigorous due diligence process that evaluates the potential price of a share. When this happens, all shares that had previously been private are converted into public ones. In the months before an IPO, the company focuses its attention on popularizing its activities and attracting more potential investors. This is the time when details about the company and the IPO are shared with the public, aiming to showcase why purchasing shares in the company will be a solid investment. </p>
<div>Throughout the years, IPOs have been rising and falling in popularity, with the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis being the year with the fewest IPOs announced. Today, in 2021, as the global economy has somewhat recovered, more companies are looking to become publicly traded. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, the initial coin offering (ICO) was designed in the same fashion as an IPO. While an IPO offers shares in a company, an ICO is the first instance when a token becomes available for purchase. As with IPOs, there are ups and downs in the number of ICOs held each year. </div>

<title>Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO)</title>

<preview>The Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) is a comparatively new crypto fundraising method exclusive to the Cardano ecosystem.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Initial Stake Pool Offering?</h2>
<div>Crypto fundraising methods have undergone a notable transformation in recent years to introduce more convenient and accessible processes for developers and investors alike. Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) is a promising new fundraising model that offers more advantages than the IDOs, ICOs, and other existing models.</div>
<div>The Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) fundraising model is unique to the Cardano ecosystem. It allows project developers to start staking pools where ADA token holders stake their tokens. For each staking pool, developers can set variable margins, collect rewards, and in turn, pay the stakeholders with their project’s utility tokens. The greater the stake in a pool, the higher the likelihood of it being selected as a validator node for the next block.</div>
<div>However, the major difference is that, unlike other models, which require investors to buy, sell, or exchange one token to buy project-specific tokens and stake them. The ISPO model allows users to use the ADA token they already hold. Instead of staking ADA in Cardano’s proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystem, users stake those tokens in the project’s staking pool to earn the project’s native token as a reward. </div>
<div>Compared to other funding options, an ISPO is more secure for investors. It is less risky because users are just giving up their ADA rewards to receive project-native rewards. The staked ADA is still theirs, and it stays in their personal, non-custodial wallets. Additionally, there is no lock-in period in an ISPO. Users not only retain full control over their assets, but they can also enjoy the flexibility of using their ADA as they want, be it unstaking, selling, trading, using the ADA to buy NFTs, or anything else.</div>
<h2>How Does an ISPO Work?</h2>
<p>Let’s consider an example to illustrate how an ISPO works. </p>
<div>In general, Cardano stake pools use the PoS (Proof-of-Stake) consensus mechanism. Hence, the network relies on network validators to verify transactions and produce new blocks. Validators are effective ‘nodes’ or stake pools that allow users (delegators) to stake their funds. </div>
<div>Powered by the Ouroboros protocol, the network chooses the staking pool with the highest amount of stakes to distribute validator rewards. So, after every epoch (which is five days in Cardano), validator rewards in the form of ADA are divided among the delegators of the winning staking pool based on the amount of ADA staked by each user.</div>
<p>With the ISPO model, delegators (users) stake their ADA in staking pools that project developers create. The staking pool with the highest stakes becomes a validator node in a block and ultimately part of the Cardano network’s consensus. </p>
<p>However, when users stake their ADA tokens in these pools, they don’t receive ADA rewards. Instead, they receive rewards in the project’s native token. The ADA rewards that would have been ideally distributed among the delegators are instead delivered to the operator of the validator node itself.</p>

<preview>ITOs are similar to initial coin offerings — but have more of a focus on offering tokens with intrinsic utility in the form of software or usage in an ecosystem.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Initial Token Offering (ITO)?</h2>
<div>ITOs are very similar to initial coin offerings (ICOs) — and the two terms are often used synonymously. However, there are some subtle differences to be aware of.</div>
<div>Instead of being used to fundraise for a new cryptocurrency, the focus of ITOs usually centers on offering tokens that have proven (or unproven) intrinsic utility.</div>
<p>This could include granting investors access to a platform through a subscription, with token holders unlocking the right to use exclusive services within an ecosystem. An example of this could include an exchange that ends up offering lower trading fees. </p>
<div>ITOs are more closely related to tokenization as opposed to crowdfunding.</div>
<div>There is a key distinction between coins and tokens in the crypto sector, even though both terms are used interchangeably for the most part.</div>
<div>Coins are cryptocurrencies that operate on their own independent blockchains such as Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum. On the other hand, tokens are cryptocurrencies that operate on an existing blockchain — and assets typically tend to use Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard.</div>
<p>ICOs fell out of favor with the public, and became less common in the crypto industry, after a number of projects were outed as scams, and others collapsed in value shortly after launch.</p>

<title>Insider Trading</title>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Insider trading happens when someone purchases or sells stocks while possessing private, material information about that stock.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Insider Trading?</h2>
<p>Insider trading is one of the most notorious offenses investors on the stock market can be accused of. For a trade, either a sell or a buy one, to be considered insider trading, the person involved in the trade should be in possession of undisclosed, private information that can influence the future price of said stock. </p>
<div>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the main governing body overlooking all trading in the United States. The SEC is also the institution that determines whether insider trading has occurred. According to their official definition of insider trading, this is: “the buying or selling a security, in breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, on the basis of material, nonpublic information about the security.&quot;</div>
<p>One of the main arguments against the legality of insider trading is the stance that non-public, material information can serve as an unfair advantage. For example, suppose a trader receives insider information that a company is planning to buy another company. In that case, this can easily be interpreted as a pre-condition for the increase of the first company’s stock value. </p>
<p>There are instances when insider trading might be legal. Examples of legal insider trading might include:</p>
<p>While these are the extraordinary circumstances when trading on insider information might be permitted, the SEC closely monitors all signals it receives with suspicions of insider trading.</p>
<p>One notable case of insider trading involves The Wall Street Journal columnist R. Foster Winans, who shared information with stockbrokers about an article he was about to publish. Thanks to this insider information, the two stockbrokers pocketed around $690,000, while the journalist’s share of the gains was $31,000. The SEC tried Mr. Winans and the brokers and successfully convicted them of insider trading. </p>
<div>Insider trading can also happen in the world of cryptocurrencies, however, it is not as tightly regulated as with stocks. For example, if a Bitcoin whale shares his plans to sell a big portion of his assets, this can be taken as a sign that the token’s price will fall. However, he will not be convicted of insider trading. </div>

<preview>When a large portion of a coin’s total supply is distributed to investors shortly after launch.</preview>
<description>
<div>Whereas Bitcoin’s supply is going to be gradually released between now and 2140, instamining involves a large portion of the total mineable coins or tokens in a project being mined in a compressed timeframe. As a result, they may be unevenly and quickly distributed to investors.</div>
<div>When a cryptocurrency goes through an instamine period, it usually involves a large amount of the digital asset being made available early on when investor appetite is typically higher.</div>
<p>The process of instamining usually leads to a significant increase in supply of the cryptocurrencies, and a lower price.</p>
<div>Instamining may be deliberate — but it can also happen accidentally due to imperfections in mining algorithms.</div>
<p>Newly launched cryptocurrencies often offer special features to broaden its appeal to investors — and sometimes, this can make it incredibly easy to mine new coins.</p>
<p>Some cryptocurrencies have explored whether there should be an initial period for instamining to lure investors into buying the digital assets.</p>
<div>Instamining should not be confused with pre-mining, although both processes have similarities in common. Pre-mining means some, or all, of a coin’s supply is generated before the digital currency becomes available to the public.</div>
<p>Some analysts claim that instamining has been linked to fraudulent activity, while others allege it can lead to unfair competition, especially if many tokens are purchased by a big group and then sold at a significantly lower price.</p>
<div>When Dash launched, it experienced issues in the algorithm responsible for adjusting its mining difficulty.</div>
<div>This resulted in two million coins, or 15% of the cryptocurrency’s supply, to be issued two days after it launched.</div>
<p>Dash coins were then sold at very low prices. While the incident did not yield massive adverse consequences, instamining can severely impair cryptocurrencies.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Institutional Investor? </h2>
<p>An Institutional Investor is an organization or a legal entity that trades in the market on behalf of its clients that may be retail investors. Institutional investors have been termed the “elephants’’ of the stock market given their profound influence over the prices as they trade with hefty volumes on a daily basis. </p>
<h2>Share and Role of Institutional Investors in a Market </h2>
<div>The role and share of institutional investors have increased massively over the past decade. They now reign over 70% of the trading volume in almost all the asset classes. Mostly, these investors do not trade their own money but make a profit off their clients’ investment portfolios. </div>
<div>The latest changes in the market structure introduced by the advent of quantitative and algorithmic trading have further accentuated the need for institutional investors. They manage multiple funds simultaneously and act as vehicles of pooled investments. With a honed team scrutinizing the continuous shifts in market indices and elaborating market swings, institutional investors are better equipped to trade when the time is right, without being exposed to the same risk as a retail investor. Compared to retail investors, institutional investors are more apt and experienced navigators of financial instruments. One of the advantages is having sell-side analysts providing them with invaluable consensus estimates, helping the latter make informed decisions that can improve the value of portfolios in the long run.</div>
<div>Institutional investors trade in such large volumes that they have the ability to affect the price discovery mechanism and contribute to market growth. The pooled money introduced by these investors is pivotal to the market. It is generally accepted that institutional investors, being legal entities, are less likely to lag in compliance with the law. Being more experienced, they are less prone to risk and know how to use their stop-loss orders timely, keeping losses to a minimum. </div>
<h2>Types of Institutional Investors </h2>
<p>There are many types of institutional investors. The six main ones are:</p>
<div>Insurance Companies: Investment comprises the pooled premiums from various clients in exchange for health coverage etc., with claims being compensated directly from the investment portfolio.</div>
<div>Mutual Funds: It is a diversified form of investment in which a professional manager deals with an investment pool, with each contributing investor having ownership of varying share percentages. Often selected by novice investors, mutual funds usually deal with liquid assets on a long-term basis.</div>
<div>Hedge Funds: Employing aggressive strategies to stomp competition and use maximal leverage, hedge funds are basically pooled investments in which the manager acts as the general partner and the investors become the limited partners. Liquid assets are majorly traded in hedge funds.</div>
<div>Banks: Banks, including commercial and central, invest on behalf of their clients e.g. bonds, private equity funds, etc.</div>
<div>Credit Unions: It is a financial organization that offers shares that can be bought at pre-determined rates by its members. The profit is reaped by the members, who are also the owners of the organization. </div>
<div>Pension Funds: It is a pool of investment, contributed by private and public sponsors that cover the post-retirement era of their select beneficiaries. </div>
<h2>What’s the Difference Between Institutional Investors and Retail Investors? </h2>
<p>A retail investor is not limited by any tenets and can choose to invest in whichever portfolio they deem fit. An individual, a small-cap investor, can also focus on a short-term investment with quicker gains. In contrast, an institutional investor is more goal-oriented and prefers long-term, large capital investment.</p>
<p>A retail investor prefers to play safe. A volatile market may scare off an individual investor, but large institutional investors prefer to take advantage of the swings to maximize gains. The market navigation by institutional investors is programmed by side-sell analysts and other experts.</p>
<p>As opposed to retail investors, an institutional investor can procure and manage larger market activities.</p>
<p>Multiple asset acquisitions are possible for an institutional investor and not feasible for a retail investor. The former has the advantage of preferential market treatment and looser regulations and is better able to procure foreign securities and other such amenities.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Insurance Fund?</h2>
<div>The insurance fund is fundamental to cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges and protocols. It acts as a defense against contract loss in leveraged trading and is used to pay the traders in the event of liquidations who fail to take measures in time to prevent their open positions from going bankrupt. Insurance funds are typically funded using exchange fees, liquidation penalties, or other means.</div>
<p>In leveraged trading, each position has a liquidation price and bankruptcy price. If a position's liquidation price goes higher than its bankruptcy price, the position is closed and liquidated, with a portion of the remaining margin typically being added to the insurance fund. Conversely, if the liquidation price goes lower than the bankruptcy price, the insurance fund covers the loss. </p>
<p>Exchange operators and protocol designers must consider insurance fund health very carefully when designing, building, and operating an exchange offering leveraged trading in order to ensure the solvency of the exchange.</p>

<title>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/integrated-development-environment-ide</url>
<file>integrated-development-environment-ide.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a type of software that helps you develop apps by merging many development tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Integrated Development Environment (IDE)?</h2>
<p>An Integrated Creation Environment (IDE) is a program that aids in the development of applications. In general, an IDE is a GUI-based workbench meant to assist a developer in creating software applications by providing an integrated environment with all of the necessary tools.</p>
<div>Debugging, version control, and data structure browsing are all popular tools that allow a developer to swiftly conduct activities without having to move to another program. As a result, it increases productivity by offering similar user interfaces (UI) for related components and cuts down on language learning time. </div>
<h2>Features of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h2>
<p>IDEs have existed for many years. These have evolved and changed over time, from being only a platform for debugging and testing to an integrated piece of software that may act as a developer's extension.</p>
<p>The following are some of the most common characteristics of an IDE:</p>
<p>Almost every IDE includes a text editor for writing and manipulating source code. Although some programs feature visual components that allow you to drag and drop front-end components, the majority have a basic interface that highlights language-specific syntax.</p>
<p>Code completion tools help programmers by finding and adding common code components intelligently. These features lower the possibility of mistakes and problems while saving developers time while developing code.</p>
<div>Compilers are components that convert programming languages into machine-readable formats, such as binary code. To guarantee that the machine code is accurate, it is examined. After that, the compiler parses and optimizes the code to improve performance.</div>
<p>Most IDEs are dedicated to a single programming language, while some do support many languages. As a result, the first step is to find out which languages you'll be programming in and then filter down your IDE options appropriately. IDE tools for Ruby, Python, and Java are examples.</p>
<p>Debugging tools aid users in locating and correcting mistakes in source code. To evaluate functionality and performance, they frequently imitate real-world scenarios. Before an application is deployed, programmers and software engineers may generally test the various code parts and discover issues.</p>
<p>Given the name &quot;integrated development environment,&quot; it's no surprise that integrations should be taken into account when evaluating IDEs. Because your IDE serves as your development gateway, integrating all of your other development tools will boost development processes and productivity. Poor integrations may generate a slew of problems and difficulties.</p>
<h2>Different Types of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h2>
<p>Virtually every programming language has an integrated development environment (IDE). Each has its own set of characteristics that make it easier for programmers to write high-quality code fast and efficiently.</p>
<p>IDEs that support many programming languages are known as multi-language IDEs. You could wish to learn to utilize a multi-language IDE as a newbie programmer (with the intention of improving your skills later). Visual Studio, for example, is a multi-language IDE that is well-known for its extensive capabilities and continuing support for extensions and updates. Introducing support for a new programming language is as simple as adding an extension.</p>
<p>As the market for mobile app development grows, there is a slew of new tools to help. To produce successful and useful apps, mobile app developers need a platform dedicated to this type of development. Android Studio and Xcode, for example, are mobile development IDEs for the Android and iOS platforms.</p>
<p>When compared to local development environments, cloud-based IDEs provide various advantages. A SaaS IDE can do long-running operations without using a local workstation's computational resources. Cloud IDEs are frequently platform-agnostic, allowing connectivity to a variety of cloud providers.</p>
<p>There are IDEs created exclusively for developers who only work in one language. Jikes and Jcreator for Java, CodeLite and C-Free for C/C++, and Idle for Python are just a few examples.</p>

<title>Intellectual Property (IP)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/intellectual-property-ip</url>
<file>intellectual-property-ip.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Intellectual property (IP) is a type of property that can be legally protected from being copied or sold.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Intellectual Property?</h2>
<p>Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind — things like novels, movies, musical pieces, software, and business methods. They're called &quot;intellectual&quot; because they exist only in the minds of their creators. But once they're created, they have a physical form — an original manuscript, a reel, or a source code. </p>
<p>Intellectual property is legal protection for original creative works. A patent, copyright, or trademark provides exclusive rights to a product or concept for a defined period of time. A well-established IP tackles the &quot;what ifs&quot; of your business and protects your product from being copied by competitors.</p>
<h2>Types of Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>A trademark identifies the source of a product or service. </p>
<p>A patent protects an inventor’s invention from being copied, made, or sold by others for a period of time in exchange for agreeing to disclose the invention to the public – upon the expiry of the patent.  </p>
<p>A copyright protects original works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression; it grants the creator the exclusive right to reproduce the work or produce derivative works, sell its copies to the public, and perform or display work to the public. </p>
<p>A trade secret is another form of intangible property. It includes formulas for commercial products and processes for producing things as well as information about business transactions. A closely related concept is know-how. Unlike a trade secret, which must be kept confidential to remain valuable, know-how is not protected unless it is recorded in some way.</p>
<h2>What Are Intellectual Property Rights?</h2>
<p>Intellectual property rights provide legal protection to the original creators. They provide an incentive to people to create new things by giving them a monopoly over the commercial use of their creations.</p>
<p>Intellectual property laws cover an enormous range of ideas and creations, including:</p>
<p>Copyrights (literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works)</p>
<p>Patents (new machines or products)</p>
<p>Trademarks (business names, logos, and slogans)</p>
<p>Trade secrets (methods and processes)</p>
<p>Domain names (like Twitter.com)</p>
<p>Copyright laws protect original works such as books, articles, plays, and computer programs. </p>
<p>Treating your IPRs as an asset can have benefits for you as your business grows. They can be sold, licensed out, or assigned to partners to help grow the company's revenue streams while retaining the ownership of the brand and reputation.</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights are a global context and exist in most countries around the world. However, the laws aren't universal. </p>
<p>But regardless of how intellectual property laws vary in different countries, they all serve similar purposes: they protect inventors' and artists’ creations from being stolen or copied without credit or compensation. As a result, this incentivizes inventors to unearth new ideas and inventions.  </p>

<title>Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/intercontinental-exchange-ice</url>
<file>intercontinental-exchange-ice.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is an American company founded in 2000 to purchase and operate global exchanges and clearing houses.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)?</h2>
<p>Founded in 2000 by Jeffrey C. Sprecher, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is one of the biggest owners and operators of exchanges for both financial and commodity markets. Mr. Sprecher is also a member of the board of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In order to be created, ICE was backed by huge multinational companies like Total, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank. </p>
<p>Initially, ICE focused on offering to trade in companies dealing with energy products like crude oil, natural gas, and emissions, soon its activities diversified. One of the main goals for ICE was to provide a better trading environment through increased price transparency, efficiency, liquidity, and lower costs.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2000, ICE has grown to become a household name among the trading and stock community. By 2010, the company had cleared more than $10 trillion in credit default swaps. </p>
<p>One of the main factors for this speedy development is ICE’s approach towards acquisitions. The company has taken a strong stance in its growth strategy that acquisition of relevant other companies and exchanges is the way to go. In 2001, ICE expanded its reach to the British market by purchasing the London-based International Petroleum Exchange (IPE). In 2005, ICE became a publicly listed company and quickly entered the Russell 1000 Index. Since then, the company has gone through more than 15 successful mergers and acquisitions campaigns. </p>
<div>In 2018, ICE announced that it would establish a subsidiary specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency trading and futures contracts based on Bitcoin. The new company, called Bakkt, offers a wide array of functionalities, all revolving around cryptocurrencies. Bakkt users can benefit from a dedicated digital wallet, and buy, sell, trade, and exchange various crypto tokens. Thanks to ICE’s established position in the stocks markets and the industry in general, Bakkt managed to secure an impressive US$182.5 million during the initial funding round. Some of the main investors include Boston Consulting Group, Microsoft, and Pantera Capital.</div>
<p>In 2021, Bakkt announced that it would become a publicly traded company thanks to a successful merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings. The new company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the name Bakkt Holdings, Inc, and ICE will retain a 65% economic interest over the entity. </p>

<title>Interest Rates</title>

<file>interest-rates.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A time-dependent charge or return made in proportion to the amount of money deposited, borrowed or lent.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Interest Rates?</h2>
<p>Interest rates are the rates which an individual or financial institution charges or earns over a specific amount of time as a result of either borrowing or investing/lending. </p>
<div>The type of assets that can incur interest rates are not limited to money, but any other financial asset with an agreed intrinsic value such as a car, a house or a cryptocurrency. </div>
<p>Borrowers are charged an interest rate when they take out credit. This interest rate is usually described in terms of annual percentage rate (APR), which is the amount that is paid each year in interest relative to the total loan amount, e.g. 5% APR. </p>
<p>Conversely, lenders and investors benefit from interest rates as profit on their investments — such as the interest paid for holding cash in a savings account. This is usually expressed as annual percentage yield (APY), which is the expected yield earned per year from an investment in percentage terms. </p>
<p>Interest rates in the world of cryptocurrency work much the same as they do in traditional finance, but with an added layer of complexity. Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, the absolute value of interest can fluctuate considerably over a given period, even if the APR or APY stays the same. </p>
<p>This is because the interest rate is related to the principal amount, i.e. the amount borrowed or deposited. If this principal increases in value, the absolute value of the interest will also increase proportionally — that is, unless rates are pegged to the US dollar or another fiat currency at the time of deposit/borrowing.</p>

<file>intermediary-middleman.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A person or entity that acts as the go-between different parties to bring about agreements or carry out directives.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Intermediary/Middleman?</h2>
<div>An intermediary can be classed as financial institutions such as crypto exchanges, investment banks, financial advisors, credit unions, mutual funds and investment trusts.</div>
<p>Using a financial intermediary brings a number of advantages to consumers — including increased liquidity and enhanced security.</p>
<p>One of the biggest perks of using an intermediary can be lower costs… that said, it is worth bearing in mind that many platforms will also add a margin in order to generate a profit.</p>
<div>Exchanges can normally achieve economies of scale, meaning their transaction fees can be much lower. It can also be a lot easier to sell cryptocurrencies quickly without suffering price slippage. </div>
<div>There can also be downsides to using intermediaries. In some cases, investors may end up holding their digital assets in a wallet on the platform — putting them at risk of losing their funds if the exchange is later targeted in a cyberattack. </div>
<div>Peer-to-peer alternatives such as decentralized exchanges can also offer greater levels of anonymity. In some cases, this will also result in reduced fees.</div>
<div>And then there’s the issue of outages. Some centralized exchanges have had to abruptly suspend withdrawals because of police investigations — leaving investors unable to access their funds. Other platforms have also gained an unwelcome reputation for going offline whenever cryptoassets such as Bitcoin make significant price moves. </div>
<div>It’s important for traders to do their own research before using a middleman, and choose platforms with strong user reviews and a solid reputation generated through years of experience — especially considering that less scrupulous companies can be prone to exaggerating trading volumes to make them seem bigger than they actually are.</div>

<title>Internal Transaction</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/internal-transaction</url>
<file>internal-transaction.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An internal transaction, also known as a &quot;message,&quot; is a byproduct of an EOA interaction with a contract address that results in Ether being transferred.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Internal Transaction?</h2>
<div>An internal transaction is the consequence of smart contract logic that is triggered by an external transaction - the transaction transmitted from the EOA to the smart contract.</div>
<div>Smart contracts are one of the most important aspects of the Ethereum blockchain. They are self-executing digital contracts that are business-automated in which the contract's provisions are encoded and no legal or central authority is involved.</div>
<div>Ethereum smart contracts, in a sense, are computer programs that have been installed on the blockchain and are used to manage Ether balance, as well as a state between code invocations, and to perform transactions. Like everything else on the blockchain, smart contracts are open to the public.</div>
<div>Smart contract transactions are normally both irreversible and traceable, and they are sent through externally owned accounts, also known as EOAs, which are often private and held by individuals. Smart contract interactions like this are fascinating because they trigger certain predefined procedures and produce side effects or byproducts that are called “internal transactions”. A single smart contract engagement can result in tens or even hundreds of internal transactions. These are value transfers that occur when a smart contract or a token transfer is executed.</div>
<div>Certain Ether and token transactions necessitate the execution of a smart contract. These appear as internal transactions in the main ETH transaction history and are not visible.</div>
<div>Transactions are changes to the state of the Ethereum chain, i.e. they write data to the chain rather than reading it.</div>
<div>On Ethereum, there are a few different state changes that can happen, but transactions are the ones that users worry about the most. Developers can employ address activity notifications, which track transfers, to tell users about their transactions, for example, exchange of value between two Ethereum accounts.</div>
<div>Internal transactions, unlike regular transactions, lack a cryptographic signature and are typically stored off-chain, meaning they are not a part of the blockchain itself. Some are stored on-chain, although this necessitates the use of additional gas, therefore it isn't being used very often. Internal transactions like this always transfer Ether exclusively, affecting address balances.</div>
<div>When internal transactions happen, there isn't a lot of information on them. As a result, consumers are frequently unaware when their address, wallet, or contract is involved.</div>
<div>Tracing transactions can take a long time. This operation, which is CPU-intensive, takes a toll on the nodes. If the node isn't powerful enough, it can break while tracing, causing problems for the rest of the data on that node.</div>
<div>Furthermore, traced results for internal transactions can be massive, making storage and retrieval problematic. Another issue is that the nodes typically limit the tracing operation to a specific number of blocks - usually roughly 30 minutes worth of blocks back. As a result, the time period following a smart contract interaction is critical for taking action if you want to be able to collect information on any potential occurrence. As a result, the time period following a smart contract interaction is critical for taking steps if you wish to be able to collect information on any potential internal transactions.</div>
<div>To summarize, one must have the time, node capacity, and processing power in order to track internal transactions. This is not possible for every blockchain user and crypto enthusiast, even though it should be a simple and readily available operation.</div>

<title>Internet Layer</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/internet-layer</url>
<file>internet-layer.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Internet layer is the third layer in the TCP/IP model and is responsible for the transportation of network packets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Internet Layer?</h2>
<p>Internet layer is the third layer in the protocol stack of TCP/IP model. The internet layer is responsible for routing packets from one host to another through the network. This layer is considered to be the core of the design since it handles the transmission control and the datagram reassembly, which is required for communication to take place.</p>
<div>An internet layer is the top layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite, i.e., the network layer in the OSI model. This is also referred to as layer 3. It is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of data across interconnected networks, using IP addresses and routing information to direct packets to their destination.</div>
<p>Unlike other layers in the TCP/IP model, the Internet layer does not provide services directly to upper layers. Instead, it provides services to the next lower layer, the transport layer.</p>
<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is probably most widely associated with this layer. IP is considered the core part of this layer as it handles basic communication functions such as creating packets, adding addressing information, and ensuring that packets are being sent to the correct location.</p>
<p>The second most important element at this level is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). ICMP works closely with IP to handle control and error messages between connected devices. Together, these two protocols help deliver content from one computer to another via an internet connection.</p>
<div>Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) has been widely used since 1981 and is now experiencing problems due to IPv4 address exhaustion; its replacement, IPv6, has been available since 1999 but has not yet been widely adopted by ISPs. </div>
<p>The Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol has also been widely implemented at this layer to provide security services, such as authentication and encryption across IP networks. Other protocols commonly seen at this level include Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name System (DNS) and Windows Internet Naming Service.</p>
<p>The internet layer is often referred to as the network layer since it is responsible for logical addressing and routing. Logical addressing is done through the use of IP addresses. IP header comprises a 32-bit source address, a 32-bit destination address, a 16-bit type field, a 16-bit fragment flag, and a number of options fields. Headers can be either IPv4 or IPv6.</p>
<h2>Network Layer vs. Internet Layer</h2>
<p>The network layer is the level of the OSI model that handles communications between two different systems. It is responsible for packet routing, delivery, and error notification for computer messages.</p>
<p>In a way, a network layer is similar to an internet layer. However, an internet layer is responsible for routing packets from any one computer to another computer on a larger network, such as the internet. A network layer doesn't care about who's sending the message or where it's going; it only cares about how to get it there.</p>

<title>Internet Memes</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/internet-memes</url>
<file>internet-memes.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A meme is an image, a video, or a piece of text that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users. They are typically humorous but can also be critical as well.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Internet Meme?</h2>
<div>An internet meme is a unique form of expression that relies on images and other types of text-based media to create jokes or commentary about specific events. Memes are usually shared through social media platforms like Facebook or Reddit.</div>
<p>Memes are the digital equivalent of a catchy song, image, or video that gets viral through social media. They are often based on an event and sometimes created in imitation by others who want to replicate its success without any original thought put into it. They are transmitted by imitation and have three key characteristics: longevity - the ability to last through time; fecundity or fertility - the capacity for replication that causes them to grow exponentially among internet users, and fidelity - ensures the original content doesn't get lost among its variations.</p>
<div>One of the earliest memes born into the world of digits and pixels was a baby. Well, a computer-animated baby and that baby went viral. In 1996, a computer-animated baby, known as Baby Cha-Cha, was created to showcase the amazing abilities of new CGI software. That animation was the first thing to go viral over the internet.</div>
<p>Internet memes play a pivotal role in developing the collective psyche of all internet users. Many people don't realize how much internet memes have changed the culture over the past two decades. They have given voice to marginalized groups who want to share their perspective with others, created new spaces for discourse where there were none before, and had real-world impacts on politics.</p>
<p>Memes are such a great way for people to get the attention of their audience and transmit ideas. Not only do they work well as an advertising tool, but some founders rely on memes to gain more recognition of what they are doing with innovative fields, like cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>What Is a Crypto Meme?</h2>
<div>A crypto meme is an image that usually takes the form of an image, video, or gif with a funny message. These messages are often targeted at crypto enthusiasts and investors. Memes are also used to make fun of people by the crypto community who either don't believe in the power of blockchain or invest in shitcoins to get rich quickly. They are the current craze in the crypto world.</div>
<p>The crypto space has been a hot topic for the past few years. It seems like crypto memes are taking over the internet, and it is hard to find anything crypto-related without stumbling on one. They represent an escape from the crypto market downturn and also promote new ventures that are taking place in the crypto space. Memes can be seen as a way for such enthusiasts to connect with the extended community.</p>
<h2>What Is a Memecoin?</h2>
<p>A memecoin is a cryptocurrency based on internet jokes. The first-ever, Dogecoin, was also the most popular at its inception, but today it stands out for being successful.</p>
<p>Many people think that cryptocurrencies are a joke, but some investors who don't usually invest anywhere have invested due to fewer barriers to entry and a huge variety. Many have done fairly well in this industry, and some investors have already made loads of money from them!</p>
<div>As of now, the crypto space is booming with new projects and investors entering the market. After Dogecoin's success, an increasing number of such projects are seeing both value growth and wider acceptance worldwide. Moreover, there were over 90 different meme coins worth checking out. The most famous of them is Dogecoin, which has the face of a Shiba Inu dog. This coin has proven successful so far, with more people adopting it every day. Apart from memecoins, there are multiple memes specifically related to the crypto community, one of which is “laser eyes.” Laser eyes indicate that a person is bullish on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is color-specific too; blue for Ethereum and red for Bitcoins!</div>
<p>When it comes to cryptocurrencies, the difference between a meme coin and &quot;proper&quot; crypto coins, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, is that the latter have utility while the first one is purely for entertainment purposes. Meme coins are often easier to buy (as their values are usually in cents) and more volatile than other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and numerous other projects have a purpose that makes them more viable than just being a get-rich-quick scheme. </p>

<preview>Internet of Things (IoT) is a global interconnected network of devices, sensors and software that can collect and exchange data with each other in real-time over the Internet.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Internet of Things?</h2>
<p>By connecting devices — from everyday appliances like toasters and vacuum cleaners to vehicles, industrial machines and more — to the internet and “teaching” them to communicate with each other, it is possible to create an interconnected network of information between these devices.</p>
<p>The resulting network paves the way for an immense amount of use cases in consumer electronics, healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, energy and environment management and other industries. Some experts predict that the number of IoT devices will grow to 75 billion by 2025, up from 20.4 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>To provide just one example, connecting a self-driving car along with all its camera, radar and LIDAR sensors to other cars, road infrastructure and wearable pedestrian devices would allow for unprecedented road safety and completely autonomous driving with no human intervention.</p>
<div>While for the most part IoT and cryptocurrency industries are only loosely related, there are some crypto projects that focus specifically on Internet of Things functionality. One of the largest of these — IOTA — aims to create a blockchain that supports fast micro- and regular transactions at zero fees, allowing IoT devices to exchange not only data, but also value.</div>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are commercial entities that provide end-users with access to the internet.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Internet Service Provider (ISP)?</h2>
<p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are commercial entities that provide end-users with access to the internet. ISPs can be either tier 1, 2, or 3, based on the physical resources available for them to be used free of cost. This is known as peering/transit value differential (PVD). </p>
<p>Tier one has enough space and usually doesn’t have to pay any cost for the internet traffic as they exist at the top of the hierarchy. However, tier 2 must pay the settlement - usually through transit agreements with tier 1 carriers. And tier 3 ISPs act as the last-mile providers. They have transit agreements with a tier 2 ISP, and without investing in infrastructure, they provide internet services to commercial and home consumers.</p>
<div>ISPs have been a part of the internet for as long as it has existed. They provide access, hosting, and information services. Some of these may only offer one type of service while others can provide all three types depending on the needs of an individual or business owner with regards to what one needs for online activity, such as browsing the web for work purposes, emailing customers remotely using mail servers which store messages sent between parties who don't want their emails read by anyone else aside from those involved in correspondence (email encryption software), and storing data files like images uploaded onto websites so they are available when needed without having two separate copies floating around simultaneously like photos saved into Cloud Services.</div>
<h2>What Is the Internal Hierarchy of ISPs</h2>
<div>The internet is a giant network of multiple small interconnected networks. Every small network is a complete unit on its own and has a full routing policy. These networks, usually known as autonomous systems (AS), have thousands of interconnected devices and nodes. Some of them are routing and switching devices that make communication inside that autonomous system easier, while others are end nodes that initiate data sending. All of these devices are assigned an IP address to keep track of where data packets are going. Due to the sheer number of devices, IP is divided into public and private IPs. Any organization can use private IPs to manage its internal LAN. All the devices communicate with each other by using the routing protocols. For all communication inside an AS, various kinds of routing protocols known as interior gateway protocol (IGP) are used, while for all outbound communications that exit the autonomous system, exterior gateway protocol (EGPs) are used.</div>
<p>Initially, each ISP could own a single autonomous system, but now each ISP must maintain scores of AS efficiently by building a point of presence at several locations.</p>
<h2>How Sending Data Through ISPs Work</h2>
<p>To understand the full extent of how ISPs facilitate the end-users while they access the internet, let's take a practical example. If users have to access CoinMarketCap, they will enter the URL in the browser or access it through the app. The request will travel from their devices to the connected local network routers, usually installed by a tier 3 ISP, where the source IPs are assigned. The routers have route tables and based on destination IPs, either they will directly route the request to the server where CoinMarketCap is being hosted. However, if they don’t have the routing table of the IPs stored, they will send the packet to DNS servers that the ISPs dedicatedly maintain and will get the stored cache from it and return it with the IP at which servers of CoinMarketCap are being hosted. </p>
<h2>ISPs as Rule Enforcing Agents</h2>
<p>ISPs are in charge of traffic shaping, route optimization, and other related tasks. They come with a list of rules that need to be followed when providing services for each customer, like preventing people from accessing certain websites due to unlawful content. They enforce these policies through deep packet inspection, which means that every website visit will be scanned against government databases. They are the backbone of a secure internet.</p>

<h2>What Is Interoperability?</h2>
<div>Blockchain interoperability, or cross-chain interoperability, is the ability to see and share information across multiple blockchains. One of the clear benefits of blockchain interoperability is being able to trade assets across various blockchains without the need for a centralized, custodial exchange.</div>
<p>Interoperability is important to a blockchain’s development as it enables users to transact across different platforms. While there are blockchain interoperability solutions available, more need to be created to connect separate blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. </p>
<div>Wrapped tokens, also known as proxy tokens, are one popular solution, with Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) being the most popular one. However, wrapped tokens require a trusted custodian to hold user funds or create a secure mint/burn protocol to ensure the consistent supply of crypto assets.  </div>
<div>Komodo is one example of a project working on a native blockchain interoperability solution through AtomicDEX, a decentralized exchange that is compatible with 99% of crypto assets. AtomicDEX achieves blockchain interoperability through atomic swaps, which are secure trades of digital assets made from one user to another via non-custodial wallets, thus creating decentralized bridges between different blockchains and protocols. AtomicDEX supports native cross-chain trading, meaning that no wrapped tokens are required. Cosmos is another example of a blockchain project focused on interoperability via its inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)?</h2>
<div>The InterPlanetery File System (IPFS) was created as one of the first completely decentralized and distributed file storing and sharing systems. While traditionally, information on the web is stored on servers with a specific location, IPFS relies on a blockchain-like system to store and distribute information.</div>
<p>For example, if you are trying to access a Wikipedia page, you would traditionally type in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) address in a web browser and be redirected to a web page stored on one of Wikipedia’s servers. On the other hand, if you try to access the same web page through an IPFS Gateway, you will receive a completely identical result; however, it would have been distributed to you through the nearest computer that has already accessed that page from IPFS. </p>
<div>In essence, IPFS functions just like a blockchain-based network of nodes, where all information is shared between the network and distributed by the closest possible source. As a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed storage network, IPFS allows users to access content distributed across the network from the nearest available peer. This significantly increases both the speed of access and the security of the information stored on the network. </div>
<p>One of the main advantages of IPFS is that it utilizes a content addressing mechanism to identify the information requested by the user. While traditionally, information on the web is accessed through a specific address, or in other words, a specific location, IPFS relies on content addressing to recall relevant information. Content addressing works in much the same way as a library works. When you are looking for a book in a library, you usually ask for the book by its title, which in essence, is a content item. On the other hand, if you said that you are looking for the book located on row 3 of aisle 7 on the second floor, this would have been location-based searching. In other words, IPFS relies on relevant content keywords to fetch the information that you are looking for, rather than searching for the specific location this information is saved in. </p>
<div>IPFS is becoming an industry standard in blockchain projects because of its flexibility and security. With the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), IPFS has become an important tool for NFT marketplaces to store information about the works they publish. </div>

<title>Intrinsic Value</title>

<file>intrinsic-value.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The intrinsic value of an asset depicts the asset’s actual worth based on a complex financial calculation rather than its current price.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Intrinsic Value?</h2>
<p>In the financial world, assets have a current value and an intrinsic value. The current value represents the price of an asset at a given moment. The intrinsic value of an asset is not tied to its recent performance but rather a complex combination of factors that might affect the long-term valuation. </p>
<p>In traditional financial analysis, the intrinsic value of an asset is tightly connected to the underlying valuation of the company issuing the asset. The underlying value of a company is determined by an array of factors, including the cash flow it reports and its projected earnings. The intrinsic value of a company’s stock is therefore also affected by such factors. </p>
<div>In essence, a stock or cryptocurrency has an intrinsic value that is not equal to the current value. It might be higher, if the company is performing well, and its stocks are expected to rise in price. It might also be lower if the company or token is experiencing hardships and its current price drops. </div>
<div>In the cryptocurrency world, the intrinsic value of a token is often influenced by the company, or individuals behind the project. Another important factor is the mission, or goal of the project. For example, Bitcoin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, is a mysterious figure, which might affect the token’s intrinsic value, as we don’t have too much information about him. However, Bitcoin’s whitepaper and mission statements carry a significant amount of power, thus pushing the intrinsic value of the token.</div>
<p>The intrinsic value of an asset is a rather abstract number because of the multitude of factors that can play a role in its formation. However, financial analysts and stock brokers have complex algorithms that help them determine intrinsic values. This is one of the most important figures that help investors assess whether they want to purchase an asset or not. </p>
<div>In the world of cryptocurrencies, sometimes, it might be even harder to peg down the intrinsic value of a blockchain project or a new token. However, with sufficient research and preparation, it is not impossible to form a strong argument regarding the intrinsic value of a project. </div>

<preview>Investing is when you put money in a financial scheme with the intent of making a gain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Does Invest Mean?</h2>
<p>Investing is the process of putting money into financial schemes, shares, properties or commercial ventures where you expect to achieve a profit. To invest is essentially the process of allocating money with the eventual expectation of getting a benefit in terms of a return in the future. You will essentially own an asset or an item with the goal of generating income from it, or where that specific asset appreciates in value, which will increase your returns when you inevitably sell it. </p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, investors tend to analyze the analytics and purchase specific types of cryptocurrencies. Some sell them quickly with incremental increases in value, while others hold onto them for prolonged periods of time with the eventual goal of them skyrocketing in value.</p>
<p>An investment can essentially refer to any mechanism that Is used for the generation of future income. Keep in mind that this can include the purchase of stocks, alongside bonds, real estate and as of the last decade, cryptocurrencies. Additionally, you can even purchase a property that can be used to produce goods, and this by itself will also be considered an investment. </p>
<p>You can essentially categorize any action that is taken in the hopes of raising future revenue to be considered as an investment. </p>
<p>For example, why do people go to college? They pay up-front, or take out loans, in order to increase their knowledge or improve a specific skill-set, with the eventual hopes and goals to gain more income as a result, and this by itself can also be considered a personal investment.</p>
<p>There are different types of investments, both economic investments as well as investment vehicles.</p>
<p>Let us look at this from a cryptocurrency perspective: if you purchased Bitcoin (BTC) today, with the eventual goal of selling it in the future at a higher cost, you are essentially making an investment in the currency.</p>

<preview>Investment vehicles are the assets (classes) in which investors put their money with hopes to increase the value of their portfolio in the future.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Investment Vehicles (Crypto-tied)?</h2>
<div>An investment vehicle is an asset or product used by investors to gain significant returns. Investment vehicles usually include securities such as stocks and bonds as well as investments including mutual funds and EFTs.</div>
<div>These elements can also be seen in the crypto space. These crypto-tied investment vehicles are a product used by investors to generate returns within the DeFi sector. Also known as a cryptocurrency fund, they are composed entirely of digital assets. Using these crypto-tied investment vehicles, traders can select their preference depending on the category risk, the assets involved, the regulations, restrictions, and diversification.</div>
<div>The category clarifies the type of regulation under which the investment vehicle falls and what type of investors can access it. For instance, products for retail investors tend to have more asset-type restrictions while using derivatives and concentration risks.</div>
<div>Varit Bulakul is the president of investment banking and digital assets at The Brooker Group, a publicly listed financial consultancy and capital management company based in Thailand. Varit was instrumental in the Brooker Group’s move to digital assets and drives the company’s vision to bring the digital asset ecosystem to the traditional financial services sector. The Brooker Group was the first publicly listed company to invest directly into DeFi and DApps projects. </div>
<p>Prior to joining the Brooker Group, Varit was an auditor at Deloitte in Bangkok and received a BA in science in accounting and finance from Lehigh University and a master’s degree in accounting from Boston College.</p>

<title>IOU</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/what-is-an-iou</url>
<file>what-is-an-iou.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An IOU, acronym for “I owe you,” is a document stating that one party owes a debt to another party.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an IOU?</h2>
<p>In simple terms, an IOU is any document that explicitly outlines and acknowledges that there is an amount of debt owed between two parties. IOUs are some of the most important documents in financial agreements because they outline the debt relationship between two entities, regardless if these are people or businesses. Despite this, IOUs are not considered legally binding. They serve more as a reminder and don’t really have a binding contractual value. </p>
<p>IOU notices can be issued for any type of debt. Usually, IOUs refer to monetary debt, but also other forms of assets like real estate and physical goods. In a broader sense, an IOU does not need to be a physical document. This can also be a simple verbal agreement between parties, outlining the amount of debt and timeframe and conditions for repaying it. IOUs are regarded as semi-formal documents, and their main purpose is to serve as a reminder that there is debt between two parties. The contents of an IOU depend on what the parties want to include. Sometimes IOUs detail the names and addresses of the parties involved, while other times, they only state the amount of debt. </p>
<div>With the rise of cryptocurrencies, a new form of IOU has arisen. Blockchain-based IOUs allow traders to create tokens that represent debt and trade between different blockchains easily. An IOU crypto token performs the same service as an IOU notice - it exists to denote a debt relationship between two parties. For example, if you lend Bitcoin to a friend of yours and you want proof of this transaction, your friend can create an IOU token, which will be stored in your personal wallet. When you send back the IOU token, essentially, you request payment for the Bitcoin you lent. </div>
<div>The flexible nature of blockchain technology, especially coupled with smart contract capabilities on some protocols, allows users to create and transfer IOU tokens easily. With the rise of ERC-20 and BEP-20 tokens, minting IOU tokens is an easy and effective way to denote debt in the cryptocurrency world. Much like traditional IOUs, crypto IOUs do not have a binding power. However, they are a very convenient way to keep debt relationships in check and have yourself a reminder of the money you borrow or lend. </div>

<title>IP Address</title>

<preview>IP addresses are unique numeric addresses assigned to devices connected to the internet or a local network.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an IP Address?</h2>
<p>IP addresses are unique numeric addresses assigned to devices connected to the internet or a local network. IP, namely “internet protocol,” is the set of rules and regulations governing the data communication between devices via a local network or over the internet. In cryptocurrency, IP address awareness is important to maintain your privacy on the internet.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, IP addresses act as labels to locate the devices and permit the flow of data among them on a network. These labels carry local information and make accessibility convenient. </p>
<p>The internet requires means to discern between different devices interconnected on the internet and IP addresses provide the way to do so and are an essential part of the internet structure.</p>
<h2>How Does IP address Work?</h2>
<div>Your device connects to the internet via a network offered by an entity (internet service provider) that grants you internet access.</div>
<div>The internet service provider (ISP) assigns a certain IP address that is allocated solely to your device.</div>
<p>Your internet activity goes through your ISP as they offer you an internet connection.</p>
<p>After ensuring compliance with the internet protocols they route it back to you. Censorship of specific content or websites in certain countries is also done using IP addresses. </p>
<h2>Classification of IP Address</h2>
<p>IP addresses can be classified into two domains: formats (IPv4 and IPv6 protocols) and types (dynamic and static). Let’s discuss them further!</p>
<div>IPv4 and IPv6 are the two formats of IP addresses. IPv4 is a 32-bit format that can form up to 4,294,967,296 combinations. It is a numeric addressing method that uses a dot (.) to separate its binary bits. It offers 12 headers and uses address resolution protocol (ARP) to map IP addresses.</div>
<div>Since the internet and crypto boom, the volume of devices on the internet is growing exponentially. To cope up with the need for IP addresses, in 1998 a new format was introduced named IPv6, a 128-bit format that features 2^128 (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456) addresses. . It is an alphanumeric addressing method that uses a colon (:) to separate its binary bits. It offers 8 headers and uses neighbor discover protocol (NDP) to map IP addresses.</div>
<div>The two types of IP addresses are dynamic and static. Dynamic IP addresses are not specific to one user. Internet service providers assign specific addresses to each connected device that are reassigned to other devices when the previous one loses access to the internet. This constant change of IP addresses makes it harder for criminals to hack into your network interface. Static IP addresses remain consistent and are mainly used by businesses that want to host their own servers.</div>
<h2>IP Address and Crypto Privacy Problems</h2>
<p>The main concern when utilizing digital currencies is on-chain security and maintenance of privacy. Without on-chain security, sharing your private details on an exchange or address can make your identity and personal information available to the public on the blockchain. That said, security is about data leakage, and a secondary component after on-chain privacy is decoupling your IP address from your identity when utilizing cryptocurrency. IP Privacy is important in circumstances where being recognized as a crypto trader can put you at risk, especially in an authoritarian state.</p>
<h2>How to Protect Yourself From Crypto IP Privacy Issues?</h2>
<p>Don't ignore on-chain security measures. If your on-chain information is public, there is no good reason for concealing your IP address. Stay away and avoid sharing your personal information with such crypto exchanges that lack on-chain protection measures.</p>
<p>The most ideal way of protecting your data is a virtual private network (VPN). Whether or not you are accessing a crypto exchange, it is better to use a VPN connection in order to prevent yourself from major hacks. If you are thinking about what is a VPN, a virtual private network is one where your location is steered off to an alternate geological area. That makes it impossible for your internet service provider to follow your online activities. Here, you replace your unique IP with the one provided by the VPN service. Therefore, no one can find your location, personal information, or crucial details using your IP address.</p>

<title>Isolated Margin</title>

<file>isolated-margin.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Isolated margin mode allows users to isolate the margin that their position uses so they can limit their potential liability to that initial margin set.</preview>
<description>
<div>Written by Yenwen Feng, co-founder of Perpetual Protocol.</div>
<div>Yenwen Feng is a cryptocurrency and technology professional with vast experience as a CEO and co-founder of several startups. Since 2004, Yenwen founded Decore (Stripe Atlas fMessengeror Crypto Companies), Cinch Network (Decentralized Derivatives), Cubie Messenger (Mobile , 500 Startups B5, 10M downloads), Gamelet, and Willmobile (Top mobile financial service app in Taiwan, acquired by Systex). Since 2019, Yenwen is co-founder of Perpetual Protocol.</div>
<p>This mode is useful for traders who want to take speculative positions, and where there is a probable chance of their speculation turning out to be incorrect. In such a situation, the user will be better protected as compared to cross-margin mode because only their isolated margin balance will face liquidation, instead of their entire margin balance. The downside of using isolated margin is that your exposure will be limited to one position in a particular market.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say Ben enters a short position in ETH worth $2000 with 5x leverage. His entire margin balance is equivalent to $2000 but Ben is only willing to risk $500 for this particular position as the conditions of the market are volatile and there is uncertainty on the direction ETH will take. Ben sets the isolated margin for this position to $500. If the price of ETH takes an unexpected turn upwards and Ben is liquidated, he will lose a maximum of $500 for this particular position.</p>
<p>When it comes to users who keep diverse portfolios consisting of positions with varying levels of risk, isolated margin is also particularly useful. Unlike using cross-margin mode which spreads a users’ full funds across their different positions, isolated margin mode will prevent the risk of liquidation across many positions. This is made possible due to independent margins (or separate wallets being created) for each position.</p>
<p>Platforms typically allow users to adjust the margin allocated for each of their positions, as well as adjust margins on an ongoing basis.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Jager?</h2>
<div>Jager is the smallest denomination of BNB, which is divisible by 8 decimal places.</div>
<p>For example, Satoshi is the smallest denomination or unit of a Bitcoin (BTC). It is named after the Telegram handle of the then Binance’s Community Manager, Jager.</p>
<p>1 Jager = 0.00000001 BNB</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are digital assets created from lines of code, which you can divide into smaller parts.</p>
<div>One part of a Bitcoin is called a Satoshi, after the mysterious founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. One Satoshi is one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin or 0.00000001 BTC.</div>
<p>Why does it matter?</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies carry similar characteristics to gold – it's valuable and has a finite supply. However, unlike gold, cryptocurrencies can be divided into smaller parts to make them more manageable and easier to spend.</p>
<p>The value of coins in circulation is also affected by how many decimal places are used. Some cryptocurrencies have only two decimal places while others have eight decimal places. For example:</p>
<p>Bitcoin has an additional zero at the end so it has two more decimal places than Litecoin (eight) and four more than Dogecoin (six). This means that the price of Dogecoin doesn't need to increase as much as Bitcoin or Litecoin to achieve the same value.</p>

<h2>What Is Java?</h2>
<p>Java is a general-purpose, class-based as well as object-oriented programming language that is designed for having lesser implementation dependencies.</p>
<p>It is a computing platform for application development and is fast, secure, and reliable. This is why Java is widely used for the development of applications in data centers, laptops, consoles, phones and scientific supercomputers.</p>
<p>The Java platform is this collection of programs that help programmers develop as well as run Java programming applications in an efficient way, and includes an execution engine, a compiler and even a set of libraries.</p>
<p>Java is generally used for developing Android apps, enterprise software, a wide range of mobile Java applications, big data analytics, programming hardware devices and server-side technologies such as Apache, JBoss, GlassFish and so on.</p>
<p>Java was originally called OAK and was developed for handling portable devices as well as set-top boxes. In 1995, Sun Microsystems changed the name to &quot;Java&quot; and modified the language to take advantage of the World Wide Web development business, in response to the failure of OAK.</p>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>JavaScript is a powerful, dynamic, lightweight, and advanced programming language. It is mostly used in web-based applications.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is JavaScript?</h2>
<div>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that is mainly used in developing web applications. In the earlier days of the internet, there were only static, non-interactive web pages. The founder of the Mozilla Foundation realized the issue and worked dedicatedly on developing a programming language to make interactive web pages by manipulating the logical structure. This structure is known as the Document Object Model (DOM). Two programming languages inspired it: Java and Scheme (a minimalist dialect of Lisp). JS incorporated the best aspects of both the languages while still managing not only an intuitive syntax but also practical libraries &amp; toolsets too.</div>
<h2>What Makes JavaScript a Powerful Language?</h2>
<div>In the world of programming, two different paradigms have become popular over time. One is object-oriented programming, where classes and methods interact through objects representing real-time relationships between them on an instance basis. Whereas in functional programming, there is no concept of shared state and mutable data. Instead, it focuses more on pure functions for a problem-solving purpose by only using first-order logic constructs, like lambda expressions or maps &amp; filters, among others, as well as higher-order functions.</div>
<p>JavaScript supports both object-oriented programming paradigm and functional programming paradigm.</p>
<p>Along with the ability to support both programming paradigms, the JavaScript engine is the second most important component in the JS ecosystem, making it a powerful programming language. The JS engine can do just-in-time (JIT) compilation. As the name indicates, JIT complies with computer code at the time of execution, improves productivity, and saves a lot of storage space.</p>
<div>There are two important components of the JS engine: memory heap and call stack. Allocation of memory happens in memory heap, whereas a call stack keeps track of function calls. Some programming languages like C# can run multiple sets of instructions simultaneously, but JavaScript can’t do this as its engine has only one call stack, and hence, it is a single-threaded language. Being a single-threaded language means that JS can’t implement parallel programming, and to counter this limitation, design engineers have added a feature of asynchronous callbacks in JavaScript.</div>
<p>This feature allows the engine to take a set of instructions from the call stack, run it in the background and return the result through the event loop after executing the asynchronous code. This way, it gives JavaScript the ability to perform parallel programming despite being a single-threaded language.</p>
<p>JavaScript is also popular among programmers as a weird programming language. However, its ability to support programming paradigms and its innovative engine have made it a famous language for next-generation technologies. Numerous inventors working in the cloud, AI, and blockchain industries are relying on its support to develop their solutions and change the world.</p>
<h2>Use of JavaScript in Crypto</h2>
<p>In popular culture, the crypto industry is a huge ecosystem of blockchain-based solutions and tokens. Developers working in the industry aim to build products that can solve problems for end-users as other industries do with their innovations.</p>
<p>As JavaScript has a huge ecosystem of prebuilt UI/UX and front-end related solutions that make the work of crypto developers easier. Developers are using Web3.js libraries to connect the backend application with Ethereum via JavaScript which makes development faster because one does not need to build everything from scratch or use multiple languages, such as Solidity if there are already ready-made components available in one programming environment. It is also an essential component of lightning apps, a network built on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the Raiden network, an infrastructure built on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Although it is a latecomer, millions of developers have helped it a lot, and JavaScript is steadily paving its way into the crypto space.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is JOMO?</h2>
<div>Joy of missing out (JOMO) is the opposite of having a fear of missing out (FOMO.)</div>
<div>It is often used by no-coiners who declare their happiness that they are not involved in cryptocurrencies, usually when prices are declining or a scam ICO is revealed.</div>
<div>The price of cryptoassets — particularly Bitcoin — is highly volatile. This means that investors who have steered away from investing in BTC and other cryptocurrencies are likely to feel a sense of JOMO when prices fall.</div>
<div>JOMO relates to the concept of a trader who is happy to not be participating in a current cryptocurrency trend or engage in panic selling.</div>
<p>For example, the price of BTC plummeted from $20,089 in December 2017 to just above $3,000 by December 2018… a decline of 80%.</p>
<p>In this case, those who did not have exposure to Bitcoin — or sold it before the price fell — are likely to have experienced some degree of JOMO.</p>
<p>Similarly, those investors who held on to BTC after 2018’s dramatic price decline are also likely to have felt JOMO.</p>
<div>Those who hold cryptocurrencies rather than sell it are known as hodlers.</div>
<p>The biggest source of JOMO is likely to be felt when ICOs turn out to be fake, reinforcing the view that cryptoassets are risky.</p>

<h2>What Is a Keylogger?</h2>
<div>A keylogger or keystroke logging software is a spying tool often used by hackers to record keystrokes made by users. Hackers use keystroke logging software and hardware keyloggers to record and access victim’s sensitive information such as bank details, account passwords, private keys, etc. for personal gains. </div>
<p>There are three major types of hardware keyloggers:</p>
<div>Keyloggers can be used to steal digital currencies from users by recording their private keys from their crypto wallets or logging their exchange passwords. This risk can easily be mitigated by using a hardware wallet and activating the two-factor authentication (2FA) feature in exchange accounts, which most major crypto exchanges support.</div>
<p>Keyloggers also have legitimate use cases. For instance, system administrators may use keylogging software to track employees’ activities. Keyloggers are also useful for law enforcement as they can be used to monitor criminals and send all recorded information to all offices efficiently.</p>
<p>In the current ecosystem, keyloggers have grown from spying tools often used by criminals or governmental organizations to a commercial market of their own, allowing the average individual to purchase their own copy of keylogging software. A common, more benign use case of keyloggers is parental control, where parents can monitor their children’s online activities. </p>

<title>Kimchi Premium</title>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Kimchi premium is a phenomenon occurring in South Korean crypto exchanges, making valuations appear higher than on other international exchanges.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Kimchi Premium?</h2>
<div>Kimchi premium is a phenomenon happening on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges that makes the valuation of certain tokens higher than their valuation on other international exchanges. The kimchi premium phenomenon is potentially perceived as an advantageous point for traders in South Korea. However, in order to actually secure gains, traders need to purchase tokens like Bitcoin, for example, on an exchange outside of South Korea, and sell it on one of the Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb. </div>
<div>There is a reason for the discrepancy between valuations on exchanges in South Korea and the rest of the world. While other tradeable commodities and assets are regulated through centralized institutions, cryptocurrency trading is decentralized by design. As blockchain technology evolves and more crypto tokens emerge, exchanges worldwide sometimes struggle to keep up with big waves of activity. Consequently, the kimchi premium phenomenon occurs. </div>
<p>Exploiting the differences in valuation between exchanges is not new in the crypto world. The kimchi premium phenomenon happens exclusively in South Korea; however, small differences in valuation appear in exchanges all over the world. Traders have noticed that and started gaining profit from these discrepancies. The process of trading between exchanges to make a profit from the differences in valuation is called arbitrage.</p>
<p>Technically, trading to exploit the kimchi premium is a form of arbitrage. However, authorities in South Korea are adamant about regulating trades on crypto exchanges and eliminate the irregularity. The government has enforced strict capital control rules that usually prevent traders from making a profit because of the kimchi premium. Other financial regulations and anti-money laundering legislation also inhibit traders from manipulating the market through the kimchi premium.</p>
<p>The kimchi premium was first identified as a phenomenon around the beginning of 2016. According to professors from the University of Calgary, between 2016 and 2018, the discrepancies due to kimchi premiums were the highest. Some reports show that in January 2018, the difference in pricing for one Bitcoin in South Korea and other international exchanges was about 55%. On average, the kimchi premium settles around 4.5%.</p>
<p>While the kimchi premium has been proven by data, there is nothing more regulators can do to control the phenomenon. As blockchains and cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, enforcing rules that cover all crypto tokens is simply impossible. </p>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>The Klinger volume oscillator is a volume-based technical indicator that compares volume to price to forecast price reversals in the financial markets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Klinger Oscillator?</h2>
<div>The Klinger oscillator is used to forecast long-term money flow trends while simultaneously identifying short-term variations. Created by Stephen Klinger in 1977, this technical indicator also forecasts price reversals in a financial market by comparing volume to price in great detail. The number of units of an asset/stock/cryptocurrency that are traded per unit of time is referred to as volume.</div>
<h2>Klinger Oscillator Trading Strategy</h2>
<div>The Klinger oscillator consists of two lines. The blue line is the KVO line and the green line represents the EMA average. The 13-period moving average is the standard signal line for determining whether to purchase and sell. The indicator is based on the notion of volume moving through an asset and how it affects both short-term and long-term price levels. As with every other technical indicator, the key point is to watch the crossover. In the chart below, notice how the blue line crossed the green line and the price of the asset also fell with it.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Why Is Klinger Oscillator Used?</h2>
<div>The Klinger oscillator is used to identify the buying and selling signals through the 13-period moving average line, which is similar to the MACD indicator. Traders become bullish when the Klinger oscillator crosses and goes above the signal line and bearish when it falls below it.</div>
<p>What Is the Best Setting for Klinger Oscillator? </p>
<div>Unlike most technical indicators, the Klinger oscillator does not have any specific values attached to its lines. Rather, you can choose the indicator time frame and set it for a period in which you want to trade.</div>
<h2>Klinger Oscillator Formula</h2>
<div>The formula for the Klinger volume indicator is relatively complicated to other technical indicators, however, traders are not required to understand it. Rather, they should focus on understanding its use. The volume oscillator is generated by deducting the 34-period exponential moving average (EMA) of the volume force from the 55-period exponential moving average of the volume force in the first stage. </div>
<p>Here’s how you can calculate Klinger Oscillator:</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<div>Traders who use the Klinger oscillator can immediately initiate another counter position after closing their initial one in the market, which means that they are always in the market as the open and close signals are identical.</div>
<div>However, the Klinger oscillator is a short-term trading technique that works well mostly on lower time frame charts. This is because when you are in the market for a long period, you collect large volumes, resulting in numerous losses and gains. Here, the end goal is to maintain a better win-to-loss ratio when you close all your positions.</div>
<div>The most popular technique used to increase the accuracy and relevance of the Klinger Oscillator is to combine it with other technical indicators especially the stochastic oscillator along with price channels, trend lines, or triangles that confirm the price breakout or breakdowns. It is also advisable to use a bunch of other indicators, like MACD, RSI, Aroon Indicator, before making a buying or selling decision in the financial markets.</div>

<title>Know Your Customer (KYC)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc</url>
<file>kyc.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Short for Know Your Customer, these are checks that crypto exchanges and trading platforms must complete to verify the identity of their customers.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Know Your Customer (KYC)?</h2>
<p>Short for Know Your Customer, this process refers to a financial institution’s obligation to verify the identity of those who use its platform.</p>
<div>Also dubbed Know Your Client, KYC is a crucial part of measures designed to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.</div>
<div>KYC is a standard practice in the investment industry to ensure that advisors know specific information about their clients — meaning it extends beyond crypto exchanges.</div>
<div>These things can include a client’s investment knowledge, risk tolerance, personal details and financial position. From a crypto perspective, this usually involves requesting photo ID such as a passport or driver’s license.</div>
<p>It is very common for credit companies, banks and insurance agencies to conduct KYC and to require customers to provide all necessary information.</p>
<p>This aims to ensure the customers are not part of corruption or bribery.</p>
<p>KYC policies have risen in importance particularly in the global finance world to prevent illegal transactions.</p>
<p>The policies give financial institutions a blanket of protection to ensure their business is being conducted legally.</p>
<p>KYC processes usually begin with collecting basic data and information about customers in a process known as electronic identity verification.</p>
<p>Details such as a user’s name, birthday, account number and social security details can all be valuable pieces of information when detecting any fraudulent activity or financial crime.</p>
<p>After receiving this information, organizations usually check a database of individuals convicted for corruption to see if any customers may overlap.</p>
<p>The information is often also compared against a list of sanctions or a list of politically exposed persons.</p>
<p>Once that is done, organizations can gauge the level of risk involved in their customers engaging in any corrupt or fraudulent activity.</p>
<div>Crypto exchanges have come under increasing pressure to roll out KYC, amid fears that criminals may be using digital currencies to evade detection.</div>
<h2>Can I Buy Crypto Without KYC?</h2>
<p>It is possible to buy cryptocurrency without KYC, but you need to find an exchange or cryptocurrency peer-to-peer service without those requirements. While most crypto exchanges and services need to follow the KYC and AML regulations of the country that they are headquartered or domiciled in, in the decentralized cryptocurrency space, it is possible to find services that don't fall under KYC regulations.</p>
<p>However, do know that using a service without KYC regulation means that the service might not be overseen by any regulatory authority. While this could be a neutral thing, it could be a bad thing if the service turns out to be a bad actor. </p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes crypto services that are regulated and/or have done their due diligence allow their users to trade in smaller amounts of cryptocurrency before requiring them to go through KYC.</p>

<preview>The consensus mechanism of Fantom blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Lachesis (Fantom)?</h2>
<div>Lachesis is the second of three main components of the Fantom stack. It’s a distributed ledger and smart contract platform, similar to Ethereum. However, it has several unique features that make it a very interesting project.</div>
<div>Lachesis is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, so it doesn’t use blocks for transactions. Instead, it uses nodes to verify transactions. </div>
<p>Fantom is the world’s first DAG-based smart contract platform that solves the issue of scalability and confirmation time of the existing blockchain technology.</p>
<div>Fantom has been designed by a team of experts in the fields of Distributed Ledger Technology, mathematics, information theory, computer science, finance, and business strategy. The aim was to build a platform where developers can easily deploy their own smart contracts and dApps on Fantom’s high-performance and scalable blockchain infrastructure.</div>
<p>The fast-growing ecosystem of dApps on Fantom will have access to a wide range of tools that will further streamline the process of development. The platform has been architected from the ground up to be future-ready for mass adoption. The technologies used are open source and completely transparent.</p>
<p>Lachesis is Fantom’s aBFT consensus algorithm. The term “aBFT” stands for asynchronous byzantine fault-tolerant. It is an improvement on the popular PBFT algorithm, which is currently used by many blockchain projects including Hyperledger and Tendermint.</p>
<p>The primary difference between Lachesis and PBFT is that Lachesis allows for asynchronous consensus, while PBFT requires synchronous consensus. This means that the time between blocks can be constant (synchronous) or variable (asynchronous). The longest time between blocks in a synchronous network is equal to the time it takes to create a block. In an asynchronous network, it takes much longer than in a synchronous network to achieve consensus, as blocks can be created at any time.</p>
<p>Although there are some disadvantages to asynchronous consensus networks, they also have some advantages:</p>
<div>Asynchronous networks are more scalable than synchronous networks because they do not need to wait for all nodes to respond before creating new blocks. Scalability is important for many applications of blockchain technology, such as supply chain management and financial transactions. Asynchronous networks allow for faster transactions and more efficient use of resources than synchronous networks.</div>
<p>One of the most interesting features of Lachesis is that it uses a reputation mechanism called Proof-of-Stake Authority (PoSA). It’s a version of the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm that adds a reputation system to the process. The PoSA mechanism allows Lachesis nodes to vote on whether or not others are working honestly or not and penalizes those who aren’t by removing their right to validate transactions. Nodes can also earn rewards if they work properly, incentivizing honest behavior.</p>
<p>Lachesis is designed to be much more flexible than current blockchain consensus algorithms, allowing for faster block times and improved scalability.</p>
<p>The Lachesis protocol assigns each node in the network a weight that corresponds with the amount of stake they have. The weight of all the nodes in the network will always add up to 100% (or 1). This weight can be used to determine the probability that a node will be selected as an Event Creator (EC).</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Slang for the type of car that many crypto enthusiasts aspire to buy when their digital assets “moon” — or rise in value substantially.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Lambo?</h2>
<div>Lambo is shorthand for Lamborghini, an exotic car that people often refer to in their excitement over getting rich from cryptocurrencies. </div>
<p>Especially in the early days, the term was common in crypto forums when contributors would ask when prices are going to rise, with them writing: “When Lambo?”</p>
<p>Lamborghinis are high-end cars that typically cost at least $200,000 — and indeed, some crypto enthusiasts have managed to capitalize on Bitcoin’s market movements to the extent where they have been able to buy one. As a result, some wealthy traders have made this purchase as a symbolic gesture.</p>
<p>In February 2018, Peter Saddington, entrepreneur and co-founder of VinWiki, bought a Lamborghini for less than $115 thanks to an early interest in cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>He cashed in 45 BTC to drive away with a Lamborghini costing $200,000. That said, at one point in 2020 when Bitcoin was trading at $24,000, this crypto haul would have been worth more than $1 million.</p>
<p>When cryptocurrency prices are about to surge, users often joke and circulate a meme around “When Lambo” referring to when the cryptocurrency holder will be able to purchase a Lamborghini or become rich as a result of their crypto assets.</p>

<title>Large Cap</title>

<file>large-cap.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Well-established projects and organizations having a market capitalization of $10 billion or above are called large cap or big cap projects/organizations.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is Large Cap?</h2>
<div>Cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization of or above $10 billion are called large cap tokens. Market capitalization of a project’s token can be calculated by multiplying the currency price with its circulating supply. </div>
<h2>How to Calculate the Market Cap of a Token?</h2>
<p>Let’s assume a token AAA has a supply of 20,000 and the price of one token is $0.20. So what would be its market capitalization?</p>
<div>Market capitalization = 20,000 tokens x $0.20 each = $4,000 </div>
<p>The market capitalization of AAA is $4,000.</p>
<p>Assuming that the market capitalization of AAA is $10 billion or more, it would be called a large cap.</p>
<p>Typically, large cap projects have a long-standing history in the market. It makes them a safer investment option for investors.</p>
<h2>Large Cap vs Small Cap</h2>
<p>Based on the market capitalization, crypto tokens can be classified into three categories: large, mid, and small cap. One of the purposes of this categorization is to let investors know what they are investing in. </p>
<p>In crypto space, a large cap token belongs to a well-established and popular project, typically belonging to the top-25 category. These are usually the most popular projects in the crypto and blockchain industry with a strong community. Besides long-standing history, a large cap project is capable of handling adverse events. </p>
<p>A project with a market capitalization value between $3 billion and $10 billion is categorized as a mid-cap project. Typically, mid cap projects have a higher percentage of growth as compared to large cap. However, they tend to be more volatile.</p>
<p>A project with a market cap ranging between $300 million and $2 billion is generally a small cap project. It has more growth potential but is most sensitive to macroeconomic shifts.</p>
<h2>Why Do Large Cap Crypto Tokens Attract Investors?</h2>
<p>Market capitalization of a project gives a lot of context to investors. While every project is different, market capitalization lets investors better judge the financial standing and the trust of the crypto community in a specific project. </p>
<p>When compared with small or mid cap tokens, large cap tokens may be preferred because of the related project’s vast business model. It promotes more consistent performance and generally means the project will be least sensitive to small news and events. Resultantly, large cap tokens are less volatile and attract more investors. </p>
<p>Staking reward is another reason to invest in large cap tokens. With an increase in prices, investors also benefit from the interest income that is offered by such projects.</p>
<p>Large cap projects are more transparent and authentic when it comes to operations. Investors can have access to the information related to the project that allows them to make informed decisions. Similarly, when it comes to publicly traded large cap companies, they must give periodic financial statements to their investors. </p>
<p>Small cap firms, on the other hand, strictly focus on business objectives. Even though they have the potential to grow rapidly, it is mostly variable. This makes small cap stocks more volatile and sensitive to headwinds. </p>

<preview>Laser eyes is a viral Twitter meme that is used by Bitcoiners who attempt to push the price of BTC to its new all-time highs.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Laser Eyes?</h2>
<div>Laser eyes is a viral Twitter meme that is used by Bitcoiners attempting to push the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to $100,000, outlining the bullish outlook for crypto. This group is confident in the future of Bitcoin and likely to have diamond hands, meaning they are only looking to accumulate more BTC and HODL for the long term.</div>
<div>Prior to being used to indicate support for Bitcoin, laser eyes have been used by superheroes, including Superman and Homelander. In other words, having laser eyes is a superpower not possessed by ordinary people. The origin of laser eyes related to Bitcoin is linked to the #LaserRayUntil100 hashtag, which started in February 2021. Twitter user @CHAIRFORCE_BTC first altered their profile picture to give it laser eyes. Generally, the laser eyes meme features two red-colored laser beams emitting from the user’s eyes, although some variations in blue, green, and other colors exist. Generally, most users feature laser eyes on their profiles for a period of 24 hours, though some have continued using the meme as their profile picture since its inception.</div>
<p>The laser eyes campaign has seen backing from the likes of Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Gemini, and National Football League (NFL) star, Tom Brady. US Senator, Cynthia Lummins from Wyoming, who is a Bitcoin investor since 2013, also changed her Twitter profile to feature laser eyes. El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, similarly added laser eyes after the nation announced the decision to make BTC legal tender. Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the third wealthiest person from Mexico, has also shown support for BTC through this meme.</p>

<title>Law of Accelerating Returns</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/law-of-accelerating-returns</url>
<file>law-of-accelerating-returns.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The Law of Accelerating Returns is a hypothesis by Ray Kurzweil based on the observations that technologies (or any evolutionary system) tend to progress in an exponential fashion.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Law of Accelerating Returns?</h2>
<p>The Law of Accelerating Returns is an idea that is akin to compound interest. It says that the rate of growth of any exponentially growing technology is itself accelerating over time, and will eventually reach a point where it will be happening so fast that extrapolating from current trends will become impossible.</p>
<p>The term has been associated with Ray Kurzweil's ideas on the technological singularity, which he describes as &quot;the future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed.&quot; </p>
<p>The law states that the pace of technological progress moves in steps, or &quot;waves&quot;. Each wave is characterized by rapid and exponential growth, followed by periods of slower growth or stagnation, (resembling non-returnable investment bubbles) until a new paradigm shift occurs.</p>
<p>The first wave began with the invention of fire and ended with the creation of cities. The second wave began with the invention of writing and ended with the printing press. The third wave began with the invention of computers and biotechnology and is still growing exponentially today. Kurzweil predicts that this third wave will end around 2045 when humans will merge with machines.</p>
<p>The law of accelerating returns is a corollary to Moore's Law which predicts that computer power will double approximately every two years. It suggests that we are involved in a process of exponential change. This understanding has implications for economic policy, social organization, education, and other areas of human endeavor. In fact, many futurists are convinced we're on the verge of another paradigm shift that will deliver computational power well beyond what we have now.</p>
<p>Kurzweil predicts that the 21st century will see an acceleration in the rate at which technological progress happens, such that by 2045, we will be able to follow a &quot;linear&quot; trend line as far into the future as we are able to project it.</p>
<p>Today, we are seeing this law proving right to a great extent. </p>
<p>The exponential growth curves that we see in technology are a result of a feedback loop between innovation and investment. The more money we invest into technology, the more capable our technology becomes at creating new and more powerful technology. And as each new innovation occurs, it allows us to make further innovations with even greater payoffs. This concept can be explained by examining three different components: empowering technologies, human capital, and investment capital.</p>

<file>layer-0.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Layer 0 is a network framework running beneath the blockchain. It is made up of protocols, connections, hardware, miners, and more that forms the foundation of the blockchain ecosystem.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Layer 0?A Layer 0 protocol is the first layer among all blockchain protocols, connecting seamlessly with all other protocols to build interconnected value chains, offering a more robust and evolved alternative to smart contracts. </h2>
<p>Scalability is one of the biggest obstacles for blockchain-based solutions. However, the Layer 0 protocol can be used across several use cases, including data validation, setting up individual reward structures, digital currency wrapping and more. It serves as the root layer, allowing cross-chain interoperability with all Layer 1 protocols like BTC, ADA, ETH and more.</p>
<p>Using the Layer 0 protocol, operators can quickly deploy relay networks across several nodes, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. It offers a unique approach to solve the scalability dilemma in the ecosystem without tinkering with the underlying protocols of the existing blockchain networks.</p>
<p>In addition to solving the scalability problem, the Layer 0 protocol also allows users to build blockchain-based businesses and dApps, validate data schemas and sources, mint cryptocurrency, and program unique business logic and metrics.</p>
<p>The Layer 0 protocol consists of a series of state channels that validate data based on user-defined functions. Alongside the hardware, servers, and systems, nodes and any device connected to the nodes are also part of this layer.</p>
<p>It supports several consensus algorithms and P2P systems, such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, proof-of-activity, proof-of-reputable observations, directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and more to optimize network topology. Layer 0 compliments the three significant pillars of blockchain — scalability, neutrality and adaptability-supporting block encryption and hiding the block’s origin using P2P relaying.</p>
<p>Native tokens serve as the core consensus layer, offering economic incentives to motivate users to contribute and sustain the ecosystem within the HGTP network, thus establishing a win-win environment in which all participants are equally rewarded for their efforts. </p>
<p>If you wish to build a business using the Layer 0 protocol, you’ll have to stake or purchase the platform’s native token. By acquiring the relevant tokens within the blockchain network, you’ll get complete access to the Layer 0 ecosystem, data-rich solutions, innovative solutions, and products. Once you have procured the required tokens, you can use them to mint your unique tokens, create business logics, reward structures, data validation, and more. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Layer 2?</h2>
<p>Layer 2 is the name given to a scaling solution that enables high throughput of transactions whilst fully inheriting the security of the underlying blockchain that it is built on. </p>
<p>Blockchains such as Ethereum have grown in popularity over the past several years as they are programable (smart contracts) and censorship resistant, meaning that a wide number of products and use cases can be built on-top of them. The problem with Ethereum is that it can only process 7 to 11 transactions per second, compared to the Visa network of over 20,000 transactions per second. As the blockchain becomes congested, economic actors (users) compete with each other to have their transactions processed in a short space of time. This leads to a bidding war for space in each block and causes the price of transactions to soar. At some points in 2021, it cost over $80 to send a token to another address on the Ethereum network. </p>
<div>In order to solve the bottleneck problem described above, layer 2 solutions have been launched to take the pressure off Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions enable transactions to be abstracted away from the underlying blockchain, meaning thousands of transactions can be processed per second. The two main forms of layer 2 solutions are zero knowledge rollups and optimistic rollups. </div>
<div>Importantly, the property that separates a layer 2 such as DeversiFi, StarkWare, Optimism and Arbitrum from a side-chain such as Polygon, is that layer 2 solutions inherit their security from the Ethereum chain itself, and are not reliant on any other network, validators or entities to secure funds, as is the case with sidechains.</div>
<div>Author: Ross Middleton, co-founder and CFO at DeversiFi  </div>
<div>Ross is the co-founder of DeversiFi, a layer 2 decentralized finance (DeFi) trading platform powered by StarkWare’s scalable technology. He is responsible for finances as well as looking after DeversiFi’s project partners and biggest customers. </div>
<p>Previous to DeversiFi, Ross worked at the Ethfinex and Bitfinex exchanges. Before joining crypto, Ross was a professional energy trader and analyst in London for ten years. He worked on global energy trading desks at companies such as Centrica, Gazprom and RWE to deploy funds into advanced proprietary fundamental-backed trading strategies. Outside of the trading world, he is a committed angel investor and Ironman triathlete. Ross brings a wealth of both non-traditional and traditional asset trading and commercial experience as well as connections to the alternative finance space. Ross holds a BSc in economics.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Layer-1 Blockchain?</h2>
<p>A layer-1 blockchain is a set of solutions that improve the base protocol itself to make the overall system a lot more scalable. There are two most common layer-1 solutions, and these are the consensus protocol changes as well as sharding.</p>
<p>When it comes to consensus protocol changes, projects like Ethereum are moving from older, clunky consensus protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) to much faster and less energy-wasteful protocols such as proof-of-stake (PoS). </p>
<p>Sharding is one of the most popular layer-1 scalability methods out there as well. Instead of making a network sequentially work on each transaction, sharding breaks these transaction sets into small data sets which are known as &quot;shards,&quot; and these can then be processed by the network in parallel. </p>
<p>One of the pros when it comes to layer-1 solutions is that there is no need to add anything on top of the existing infrastructure.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Ledger?</h2>
<div>In the world of cryptocurrencies, a ledger is known as a record-keeping system. </div>
<div>The ledger keeps track of different participants’ balances and all transactions that take place. </div>
<p>However, the participants’ identities remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Public ledgers were used much prior to the birth of digital assets, but have risen more in prominence since the crypto markets roared to life.</p>
<p>Both parties involved in a cryptocurrency transaction can verify the details on the ledger. </p>
<div>Blockchain is a key type of distributed ledger technology that records a list of financial transactions or blocks that cannot be changed, making it immutable.</div>
<div>Ledgers tend to be decentralized, meaning that they are not overseen by a single central authority.</div>
<div>Once a block reaches full capacity, new ones are added to the ledger — and select network participants dubbed as full nodes also retain a copy of the ledger. </div>
<p>This means they have oversight on the network, on the people who use it, and whether transactions are genuine.</p>
<p>There are many challenges in using a ledger. </p>
<p>The nature of blockchain requires every transaction to be recorded on the network — and there can also be security concerns.</p>
<p>These relate to fears that hackers, governments and security agencies can track public records and information about network participants. </p>

<preview>Money that a trader borrows from a brokerage, enabling them to gain far greater exposure to a position than what their capital allows.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Leverage?</h2>
<div>Leverage is a loan offered by a broker on an exchange during margin trading to increase the availability of funds in trades.</div>
<p>The term leverage relates to the extent by which a trader’s position and hence profitability has risen through the loan. </p>
<p>It is also known as the amount of debt borrowed by a firm to fund assets. </p>
<p>Leverage is used by investors to increase their purchasing power in the market. </p>
<div>For instance, take a $100 Bitcoin position. Assuming a trader’s position was increased by a leverage of 50x — commonly expressed as a ratio of 1:50 — this would mean the $100 BTC position is now $5,000. </div>
<div>The amount the trader initially has is called margin. This amount is used as a collateral if the cryptocurrency or asset in question falls. </div>
<div>Margin trading is exceptionally risky. As well as amplifying profits, it can also exacerbate gains. This strategy can be applied to both long and short positions.</div>
<p>Shorting is an investment technique a trader may adopt if prices are expected to fall. Meanwhile, going long is a strategy that can be implemented when the price of a cryptocurrency is expected to appreciate. </p>
<p>The amount of leverage that an investor can access will depend on the trading platform they choose, as well as the digital asset they are wishing to gain exposure to. </p>
<p>Some countries have sought to clamp down on margin trading amid fears that it could cause extensive losses among less experienced investors.</p>

<title>Leveraged Tokens</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>In the world of cryptocurrencies, leveraged tokens give you a leveraged position in trading, meaning that your earnings and losses are multiplied.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Leveraged Tokens?</h2>
<div>These are ERC-20 tokens that offer leverage to holders. By using these tokens, you automatically gain a leveraged position, unlike traditional trading methods. These tokens offer convenience as they don’t require you to take care of the margins or to have an understanding of liquidation risk.</div>
<div>Leveraged tokens feature both fixed and variable leverage. Conventionally, these assets rebalance themselves daily at 00:02:00 UTC or when the spot market price changes by 10%. However, it’s not the same for all crypto exchanges. Some exchanges have different sets of rules in place for rebalancing.</div>
<p>Important Note:</p>
<p>Make sure you properly understand leveraged tokens before you trade them because of their high-risk nature.</p>
<h2>How Is Leverage Calculated?</h2>
<p>Let’s say you are holding a 3X Long Bitcoin Token and its price is $19,269.15. The leverage will be 3X =$19,269.15*3/$19,269.15+3*($19,269.15–$19,269.15).</p>
<p>Now, in case the price of 3X Long Bitcoin Token increases to $20,000, the leverage will be $20,000*3/$20,000+3*($20,000–$20,000).</p>
<p>When the price of a 3X Long Bitcoin Token (or any leveraged token you are using) decreases, the leverage goes up. On the other hand, if the price increases, it goes down. </p>
<p>For every 1% Bitcoin goes up in a day, 3X Long Bitcoin Token goes up by 3%; for every 1% Bitcoin goes down, 3X Long Bitcoin token goes down 3%.</p>
<h2>Why Are Leveraged Tokens Used?</h2>
<p>These are used mainly for the following three reasons:</p>
<p>Leveraged tokens manage risk on their own. They automatically reinvest the profit into the underlying asset and sell some of them online when the price drops—to avoid potential liquidation risk. </p>
<div>You can gain a leverage position in the cryptocurrency market without taking margin, collateral, liquidity, and other such features into account. In simple words, you can spend $19,269 or whatever is the current price and have a 3X Long Bitcoin Token. </div>
<p>Essentially, these are ERC-20 tokens, which means you can withdraw them whenever you want. Leveraged tokens are preferred over margin positions because you have the liberty to send them to any ETH wallet or transfer to any other platform that supports them. </p>
<h2>How to Buy or Sell Leveraged Tokens?</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to buy or sell leveraged tokens. However, three of the most common ways include:</p>
<div>Spot markets are recommended to buy or sell them. You have to visit the spot market of the leveraged token on any exchange to trade these tokens.</div>
<p>Another way is by converting your cryptocurrency in your wallet to leveraged tokens.</p>
<p>The least common way among the three is the creation or redemption of leveraged tokens. This method is only suitable when you’re completely aware of their working and have gone through the documentation of the platform.</p>
<p>Leveraged Tokens are high-risk products and you should consider their pros and cons before trading them. </p>

<preview>Libp2p is an open network protocol for decentralized peer-to-peer networking.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Libp2p?</h2>
<div>Libp2p is an open-source network stack that lets you build modern, fully distributed applications. It provides a common set of tools for building peer-to-peer applications and services, like chat and file sharing, that work together seamlessly. </div>
<p>Libp2p is the foundation for IPFS, but can also be used in other applications that require a network stack.</p>
<div>The libp2p project was founded by Protocol Labs with the mission of building a fully decentralized stack. It is an umbrella project that aims to unify the fragmented landscape of peer-to-peer protocols, providing intuitive APIs and documentation that enable developers to easily build distributed applications. The libp2p architecture consists of modular components that can be used independently or in combination with other components. Together, these form a flexible and extensible platform for building and deploying decentralized protocols.</div>
<p>Libp2p is a set of networking libraries. It provides several abstractions that help you write robust, scalable and portable applications:</p>
<p>A modular and extensible abstraction layer to different network transports such as UDP, TCP, HTTP1, WebSockets, tls, mqtt and others.</p>
<p>A collection of standard transport protocols implementations like TCP, UDP, etc.</p>
<p>An implementation of the libp2p network stack to connect different applications by defining their communication interfaces in a human-readable and accessible way.</p>
<div>The networking layer is built on top of IPFS (interplanetary file system) and Ethereum blockchains.</div>
<div>The purpose of libp2p is to provide easy-to-use abstractions for common peer-to-peer use cases. It can be used as a foundation for more specialized P2P systems. It also addresses some of the common pitfalls of developing P2P systems by providing higher-level abstractions and modularity.</div>
<p>At this point, libp2p only contains networking layers, although there are several separate efforts underway to build out the stack toward a full-featured decentralized web stack.</p>

<preview>Light nodes are typically downloaded wallets and are connected to full nodes to further validate the information that is stored on the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Light Node?</h2>
<p>There are three distinct types of nodes, one is a miner node, the other is a full node and the last one is a light node. </p>
<p>A node is any device that is connected to the blockchain. This includes servers, computers, laptops, online or desktop wallets, and even mobile phones. All of the nodes are then connected to the blockchain in some way and are constantly updating each other with the latest information that is added to it. Nodes are a critical component to the infrastructure of the blockchain itself, and they act as a validation for the ledger which allows anyone to transparently see the transactions or data that is conducted and even held on the network.</p>
<p>Here, the core benefits of the nodes are to ensure that the data which is held on the node  is valid, secure and accessible to the authorized parties.</p>
<p>When it comes to nodes, they are typically classified into two types or categories: one is full nodes, and the other is what we are discussing here, known as light nodes. </p>
<p>Light nodes are typically downloaded wallets and are connected to full nodes to further validate the information that is stored on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The difference here is that light nodes are smaller in size and only hold information about partial blockchain histories. </p>
<p>Full nodes, on the other hand, are a single copy of an entire blockchain history including the transactions, timestamps and all created blocks.</p>
<p>Back to light nodes, they have a similar purpose to full nodes; however, instead of holding a complete history of a blockchain, they typically hold a block header that seeks to support and query the volatility of the previous transactions. The block header is this detailed summary of a specific block which includes information that is relating to a particular previous block that it is connected to.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Lightning Network?</h2>
<div>The Lightning Network is a &quot;second layer&quot; payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain. It is designed to enable fast, scalable transactions between and across participating nodes, and has been touted as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problem.</div>
<p>Transactions are normally conducted on the blockchain, but Lightning involves taking transactions off-chain. </p>
<div>The Lightning Network was initially introduced to take the strain off the Bitcoin network and to lower associated transaction fees. </div>
<div>Bitcoin’s critics have pointed out that, right now, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency is ill-equipped to play a role similar to fiat — primarily because it can only handle about seven transactions per second. By contrast, payment giants such as Visa can handle tens of thousands.</div>
<p>The Lightning Network is effectively a second layer for Bitcoin’s blockchain — creating payment channels to facilitate transactions. </p>
<p>Transactions are much faster as parties can transact with each other without everything having to be approved by nodes. </p>
<p>By contrast, the standard blockchain ledger does require approval from nodes in the blockchain, each of whom determines the authenticity of the transactions. </p>
<p>There are costs associated with using the Lightning Network, and critics claim that this scaling solution is also prone to hacks. They are also required to constantly be online, something which can prove to be a challenge. </p>
<div>Unfortunately, the Lightning Network does not allow BTC to be placed in cold storage.</div>

<title>Limit Order</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/limit-order</url>
<file>limit-order.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A limit order is a type of order to purchase or sell a security at a specified price or a better one. </preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Limit Order?</h2>
<p>A limit order is a type of order to purchase or sell a security at a specified price or a better one. </p>
<p>When it comes to buy limit orders, the order will be executed at a point where the limit price or a lower one occurs, while for the sell limit orders, the order will only be executed when the limit price is achieved or a higher one. This stipulation allows traders to control the prices they trade at better.</p>
<p>Through using a limit order, an investor can essentially guarantee to pay that price or less, while the price is guaranteed. The filing of the order is not guaranteed, however, and limit orders will not be executed unless the security price meets the order qualifications. If the asset doesn't reach the specified price, the order is not filled and the investor might miss out on the trading opportunity.</p>
<p>Limit order uses a pre-specified price to buy or sell a security.</p>
<p>If a trader is looking to buy a stock but has a specified limit, let's say $10,000, they will only buy the stock at a price of $10,000 or lower. You can say this in terms of cryptocurrencies as well, when the trader has 5 ETH, and can only buy another asset at 5 ETH or lower. When the trader is looking to share the shares with the limit, the trader will not sell any shares until the price is at that $10,000 limit or higher (or 5 ETH or higher in another case). </p>
<p>When using a buy limit order, the investor is actually guaranteed to pay the buy limit order price or better, but what isn’t guaranteed is that the order will be filled. A limit order gives the trader more control over the execution price, and this is specifically the case if they are fearful of using a market order throughout periods of a higher level of volatility.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Limit Order/Limit Buy/Limit Sell?</h2>
<div>Whereas market orders see traders sell their cryptocurrency at the current price, limit orders give traders a degree of control over when a transaction is executed.</div>
<p>A buy limit order gives investors the opportunity to gain exposure to a digital asset when prices fall to a certain level. However, there are no guarantees that an order will be filled.</p>
<p>This strategy can also have its risks. For example, if a trader has a buy limit set at $3,200, and Bitcoin falls to $3,205, they would miss the opportunity to enter the market.</p>
<p>As you would expect, sell limits enable traders to offload cryptocurrencies when the market price rises to a level they have pre-determined.</p>
<p>Limit orders shouldn’t be confused with stop orders, which are used to minimize losses and exit a particular position before prices deteriorate further.</p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages associated with buy orders is that they prevent traders from paying a higher price than they expected to — and this can be something of a blessing in the fast-moving, volatile cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<p>They can also help to remove some of the emotion out of trading. Professionals can outline their desired strategy and price targets in advance, and know that they will automatically be fulfilled. This can prevent last-minute decisions that may cause traders to get greedy or chase losses.</p>

<preview>LINK is an Ethereum-based token that is used to pay Chainlink node operators.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is LINK (Chainlink)?</h2>
<div>LINK (Chainlink) is the utility token of Chainlink that serves as a bridge between smart contracts and off-chain entities such as APIs, conventional banking, data feeds, etc. LINK is used to pay node operators that retrieve data from off-chain resources – and for other services too. This way, Chainlink allows smart contract creators to communicate with outside data sources, making it possible to develop smart contracts that are connected to real-world events.</div>
<div>Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts on its platform to data from the real world. Blockchains can’t access the outside data, so oracles take up the role of data feeds. Oracles provide external data and trigger smart contract executions upon meeting certain pre-defined situations. Chainlink has opened up several possibilities for smart contract applications as it allows them to access data from outside their networks. This results in enabling them to make automated agreements more intelligent.</div>
<p>Chainlink was developed by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis. It is well-known for being the first oracle service on the market and has established partnerships with companies such as Google Cloud, Oracle, SWIFT, and Intel.</p>
<div>LINK is an ERC-677 token, which inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard. This is why many would call it an ERC-20 token as well. The ERC-677 token standard defines a two-way bridge that allows interoperability between different blockchains. The two-way bridge is based on the ERC-20 token standard, where users can transfer tokens from one blockchain to another by sending them to a contract address on the second blockchain.</div>
<p>ERC-677 supports all of the basic functionality of ERC-20, plus the ability to specify a recipient when transferring tokens. This means that transfers and approvals can be directed to contracts, allowing tokens to be used directly in other contracts.</p>
<p>For example, a smart contract can automatically payout if an external event takes place like a weather event, sports game result, or fluctuation in currency value.</p>
<p>LINK is an ERC20 utility token that serves as a payment mechanism for Chainlink nodes to provide data to smart contracts (oracles are paid with LINK). The more data requests that are serviced by a node, the more LINK they earn.</p>
<div>LINK has a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens. Since only 350 million were sold during its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, there is a 650 million remaining supply of LINK tokens. 30% were allocated to LINK’s founding team while the remaining 35% are used in its token reward system. </div>

<title>Liquid Market</title>

<preview>A liquid market features a large number of buyers and sellers. It is a platform where all the trades are executed with ease and at a low cost.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Liquid Market?</h2>
<p>A trade market is usually classified into a liquid market or a thin market. </p>
<div>A liquid market features a large number of buyers and sellers. It is a platform where all the trades are executed with ease and at a low cost. This free-flowing state of a market is termed as “liquid”.</div>
<div>The exact opposite of such a market is a thin market where the difference between available buyers and available sellers is huge. Typically, there is a low number of available buyers and sellers.</div>
<p>An example of a liquid market would be one of the biggest stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange, where millions of shares are traded every day. Such a high volume of trades and easily executable transactions occur at low costs, which implies that the market is liquid. </p>
<p>In contrast to that, real estate isn’t a liquid market because of the limited buyers in the market. Although, in some regions of the world, the number of sellers in this market are found in abundance. Not to mention, the transaction process in real estate is complex too as it requires the processing of multiple documentation and banking activities.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Liquidity</h2>
<div>Liquidity is important for all assets classes. In the crypto market, the liquidity of a coin/token is defined as the ability of the crypto asset to be easily converted into cash or other cryptocurrencies.</div>
<h2>Why Does Liquidity Matter?</h2>
<p>When a market is liquid enough, it creates an equilibrium market price that is accepted by all. In such a market, it is quite difficult to manipulate the price due to the equality between buyers and sellers. Therefore, for a healthy trading environment, it is quite necessary for traders to go for an asset with a high level of liquidity. </p>
<div>Liquidity brings stability to prices. Otherwise, large trades can cause huge swings in prices, which in turn, increase volatility and risks in the market. It also allows both buyers and sellers to close the trade quickly, leading to a tighter bid-ask spread.</div>
<h2>Factors Affecting Liquidity</h2>
<p>One of the factors that affect the crypto market’s liquidity is the trading volume. If the daily trading volume of a crypto token/coin is higher, it means that a lot of people are buying and selling it. Opportunities for crypto trading are increasing with the growing number of exchanges. It is another factor contributing to its liquidity as a whole as it opens gates to mass adoption.</p>
<p>Usability is another factor that affects liquidity. With more people and merchants accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment medium, it is becoming more liquid. </p>

<title>Liquid Staking (Fantom)</title>

<file>what-is-liquid-staking-fantom.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A staking mechanism by the Fantom blockchain that allows you to earn yield by staking tokens for a longer duration.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Liquid Staking (Fantom)?</h2>
<div>The liquid staking platform will allow Fantom (FTM) token holders to participate in the proof-of-stake consensus on the Fantom network and earn rewards. This mechanism utilizes the Proof of Liquid Staking (PoLS) algorithm.</div>
<p>PoLS is a variation of Proof of Stake (PoS) that allows for a single validator to stake tokens on behalf of multiple delegators. This means that a single staked account can act as a proxy for multiple accounts.</p>
<div>The primary benefit of PoLS is that it enables users with small balances to participate in staking. Delegators can choose from a list of validators and select which one they wish to stake with, providing much more flexibility than traditional PoS algorithms.</div>
<div>Validators can delegate their Fantom token balance to another entity (like a Staking Service Provider) and still receive a portion of the staking revenue share. This is similar to how a miner delegates hash power to a mining pool, which pays the miner in proportion to their hash rate contributed.</div>
<p>Liquid staking implies that even if you are not running a node yourself, you can still benefit from delegating your FTM tokens and receiving rewards for it.</p>
<p>The mechanism works like this:</p>
<p>Delegators lock their FTM tokens on an Ethereum smart contract.</p>
<div>In doing so, they provide liquidity (FTM) for the network and are compensated for that with Liquidity Rewards (L-Reward). The L-Reward is paid in proportion to their contribution toward network liquidity.</div>
<p>Validator pools stake these liquid tokens and collect Staking Rewards (S-Reward). The S-Reward is determined by consensus rules and dependent on total stake size and validator performance. The S-Reward is paid in proportion to their contribution toward network security.</p>
<div>Fantom is the world’s first DAG-based smart contract platform. It has been able to solve scalability issues by making its network asynchronous in nature. In a typical blockchain network, each node must wait for the previous transaction to be completed before it can start the next one. This approach restricts the number of transactions per second.</div>
<div>Liquid staking is the process of taking your staked FTM tokens and moving them to an address that's not your own. In Fantom, the process of liquid staking is a special one, and it's possible because of the Lachesis consensus algorithm. The steps include in this process are:</div>
<p>You stake FTM in your wallet. You take those tokens and move them to another wallet, or exchange them for other assets. If you want to unstake your FTM (and you've waited at least 28 days), you can.</p>
<p>Because Lachesis doesn't rely on validators and instead uses a set of randomly selected active nodes, there's no need for a validator to hold the asset that's being staked in order for it to be validating.</p>
<p>This means that when staking FTM on Fantom, you're not just receiving rewards for holding your tokens in someplace - you're contributing to the network by making sure that there are enough active nodes contributing to consensus.</p>

<file>liquidation.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Liquidation refers to the conversion of an asset or cryptocurrency for fiat or its equivalents.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Liquidation?</h2>
<div>Liquidation refers to the conversion of an asset or cryptocurrency for fiat or its equivalents such as Tether (USDT) and other stablecoins, which can be voluntary or forced. Forced liquidation involves automatic conversion when a trade meets set conditions. In the cryptocurrency industry, force liquidation occurs with margin trading where a trader’s position automatically closes when they fail to maintain the needs of a leveraged position.</div>
<div>Note that margin trading involves leverage, which is the multiple of the funds that a trader borrows in order to boost their position. Higher leverage means a lower price range for liquidation. </div>
<div>For example, if you want to margin trade BTC/USDT but only have $50, you’re going to need to borrow the remaining $450, which gives you a 10x leverage. If Bitcoin dips by 10%, your investment will be gone and any more losses would eat up the borrowed funds. Since the lender doesn’t want to take that risk, they will convert their BTC to USDT to recoup their share before the price falls further, which means your margin trade will be liquidated.</div>
<p>In some cases, forced liquidation happens before depletion of a trader’s actual share and charges a fee for the same.  However, margin trading platforms such as Binance enable users to calculate the liquidation price before entering a leverage position. Mostly, the liquidation price takes into account the position size, leveraged amount, and account balance.</p>
<p>Apart from margin trades, liquidation also happens in the futures market. </p>
<p>Voluntary liquidation, on the other hand, refers simply to a trader deciding to cash out their crypto-asset for their own reasons.</p>

<preview>How easily a cryptocurrency can be bought and sold without impacting the overall market price.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Liquidity?</h2>
<div>In its most simple form, liquidity refers to how easy it is to convert cryptocurrency into cash quickly — and whether this can be achieved without the asset’s value suffering.</div>
<div>Bitcoin, the world’s first and most actively traded digital asset, is often recognized as being the most liquid virtual currency. </div>
<div>Liquidity can also be used when weighing up which exchanges enable trades between fiat and crypto to be completed instantly and without price slippage. The levels of liquidity will often depend on how many users that particular platform has.</div>
<p>In a perfectly competitive market, liquidity will erode the ability to charge a discounted price or a premium. This is because active trading of a cryptocurrency or any asset class helps avoid price distortions. </p>
<p>A cryptocurrency which is liquid typically trades around its market price. </p>
<p>The most liquid market in the world is the forex market. On average, it recorded $6.6 trillion in daily transactions a day as of April 2019, according to the Bank for International Settlements. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the real estate market is typically considered to be illiquid. This is because properties are often not easily sold, and can involve a long chain, a lot of paperwork as well as be subject to other variables. </p>
<p>Liquid markets are typically preferred by traders. An illiquid market makes it very difficult for participants to enter and exit positions. </p>
<p>Trading volumes for Bitcoin are now comfortably in the tens of billions on a daily basis, and have grown substantially since 2014. </p>
<p>This is not to say that the bellwether currency has never experienced bouts of illiquidity. Once BTC prices crashed in 2018, volumes plummeted to around $5 billion per day. </p>
<p>The liquidity of cryptocurrencies is likely to increase further if adoption rises, and virtual assets become more widely accepted as mediums of exchange. </p>

<title>Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A liquidity bootstrapping pool is essentially a contract that manages a core pool containing tokens to be used on an exchange.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)?</h2>
<p>Liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs) are also known as configurable rights pools or smart pools. A smart pool essentially is a contract that manages a core pool that contains tokens to be used on an exchange. Unlike other shared pools, smart pool controllers have the power to change the specifications of the pool in limited ways. Hence, a smart pool is less trustless than a shared pool but at the same time, does not require the entire trust of a private pool.</p>
<p>The main inspiration behind an LBP is the ability to launch tokens with low capital requirements. To achieve this, a two-token pool is set up with a project and a collateral token. The weights are then set in favor of the project token (at first). Over time, a gradual flip occurs where the collateral coin is favored by the end of the token sale. Controllers can calibrate the sale to keep the price relatively stable to maximize revenue or can decline the price to the desired minimum (e.g. the initial coin offering price). </p>
<p>Another unique configuration of LBPs is the ability to pause swapping whenever needed. A pool controller may want to do this for a variety of reasons such as strong, unexpected demand driving up the token price or people selling tokens back to the pool for profit instead of buying them. When there is no incentive for a whale to profit from a “rug pull” or a similar technique that leads to instant price volatility, this allows for more fluid price discovery for the token. Despite the power to disable swapping, it’s quite rare since the pool operator is incentivized to leave swapping fully enabled as the main goal of a token sale is to sell tokens.</p>
<p>To use a hypothetical scenario, say a new project wants to hold a token sale while at the same time, build deep liquidity. They can do this by enabling a custom weight/ratio and also the ability to set a fee charged by the pool. This is ideal for distributing new tokens since the LBP controller only needs to provide the new tokens and a small portion of a second asset (e.g. DAI) to start the pool and initiate distribution. Since the parameters are set in a way that releases tokens slowly with changing weights, whales are forced to split their trades into separate, small traders over a longer period of time. Thus, making it easier for everyone else to get in during the course of the sale.</p>
<p>In some cases, whales may decide to wait until the very end of an LBP to buy large positions which then causes the price to pump quickly. However, due to the restrictions of the LBP, a rug pull event is near impossible, hence protecting the value of the token after the pump as the token price initially increases but continues to trickle downwards over time. This process continues until all tokens are sold and the token is evenly distributed effectively.</p>
<p>LBPs are a great solution for those who want to get tokens into the hands of a user base without the limitations of a rapidly increasing price curve. LBP represents the future of fundraising for small projects struggling with liquidity. Unless people buy the tokens faster than the price decreases, then it’s an efficient way to ensure maximum distribution.</p>

<div>A mechanism or process in which participants supply cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools, and are rewarded with fees and tokens based on their share of the total pool liquidity. These pools consist of liquidity in pairs of coins or tokens, accessible via Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs).</div>
<div>In traditional finance (TradFi), brokerage houses and firms serve as market makers, providing purchase and sale solutions for investors. They are compensated for the risk in holding assets to provide liquidity to the market, and also earn a profit through the spread between the asset bid and offer price – or example, when an investor sees that a particular stock has a bid price of $100 and an ask price of $100.20, this indicates the market maker has bought the shares for $100 and is selling them for $100.20, earning a profit of $0.20.</div>
<div>Unlike TradFi exchanges, DEXs are always available for trading via the usage of AMMs and liquidity pools. A basic liquidity pool creates a market for a particular pair of assets on a DEX – i.e. UDSC/RIN. When the pool is created, a liquidity provider sets the initial price and proportion referencing the market to determine an equal supply of both assets. This concept of an equal supply of both assets remains the same for all the other liquidity providers willing to supply liquidity to the pool.</div>
<div>Liquidity providers are incentivized in proportion to the amount of liquidity they supply to the liquidity pool. When the trade is facilitated, the transaction fee is proportionally distributed among all liquidity providers, and smart contracts govern what happens in the liquidity pool, where each asset swap facilitated by the smart contract results in a price adjustment.</div>

<preview>Liquidity pools are crypto assets that are kept to facilitate the trading of trading pairs on decentralized exchanges.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Liquidity Pool?</h2>
<p>Liquidity pools are pools of tokens locked in smart contracts that provide liquidity in decentralized exchanges in an attempt to attenuate the problems caused by the illiquidity typical of such systems. Liquidity pools are also the name given to the intersection of orders which create price levels that — once reached — see the asset decide whether to continue to move in uptrend or downtrend.</p>
<div>The decentralized exchanges that leverage liquidity pools are the same that make use of automated market maker-based systems. On such trading platforms, the traditional order book is replaced by pre-funded on-chain liquidity pools for both the assets of the trading pair.</div>
<p>The advantage of using liquidity pools is that it does not require a buyer and a seller to decide to exchange two assets for a given price, and instead leverages a pre-funded liquidity pool. This allows for trades to happen with limited slippage even for the most illiquid trading pairs, as long as there is a big enough liquidity pool.</p>
<div>The funds held in the liquidity pools are provided by other users who also earn passive income on their deposit through trading fees based on the percentage of the liquidity pool that they provide. </div>
<p>One of the first decentralized exchanges to introduce such a system was Ethereum-based trading system Bancor, but was widely adopted in the space after Uniswap popularized them.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Liquidity Provider?</h2>
<p>A liquidity provider is a user who funds a liquidity pool with crypto assets she owns to facilitate trading on the platform and earn passive income on her deposit.</p>
<p>Liquidity pools are leveraged by the decentralized exchanges that use automated market maker-based systems to allow trading of illiquid trading pairs with limited slippage. Instead of using traditional order book-based trading systems, such exchanges use funds that are held for every asset in every trading pair to allow trades to be executed.</p>
<p>While trading illiquid trading pairs on order book-based exchanges could lead to suffering from great slippage and the inability to execute trades, the advantage of liquidity providers is that trades can always be executed as long as the liquidity pools are big enough. For this reason, liquidity providers are seen as trade facilitators and paid with the transaction fees paid for the trades that they enabled.</p>
<p>How much liquidity providers are paid is based on the percentage of the liquidity pool that they provide. When funding the pool, they are usually required to fund two different assets to enable traders to switch between one to the other by trading them in pairs.</p>
<p>For instance, a liquidity provider may provide a liquidity pool with $5,000 worth of Ether and $5,000 of USD-pegged decentralized stablecoin DAI to allow trading back and forth between the two. This way, every time a trade on the ETH/DAI is executed, the liquidity provider in question would receive compensation for having funded the pool in question.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Are Liquidity Provider Tokens (LP Tokens)?</h2>
<div>Liquidity provider tokens or LP tokens are tokens issued to liquidity providers on a decentralized exchange (DEX) that run on an automated market maker (AMM) protocol. Uniswap, Sushi and PancakeSwap are some examples of popular DEXs that distribute LP tokens to their liquidity providers.</div>
<p>LP tokens are used to track individual contributions to the overall liquidity pool, as LP tokens held correspond proportionally to the share of liquidity in the overall pool.</p>
<p>At the most basic level, LP tokens work on the following formula:</p>
<p>Total Value of Liquidity Pool / Circulating Supply of LP Tokens =  Value of 1 LP Token</p>
<p>In terms of technical properties, LP tokens aren’t very much different from other tokens on the same network. For example, LP tokens issued by Uniswap and Sushiswap, both of which operate on the Ethereum network, are actually ERC20 tokens. Like any other ERC20 token, these LP tokens can be transferred, traded and staked on other protocols.</p>
<p>Just like any other token, holding LP tokens gives liquidity providers complete control over their locked liquidity. Most liquidity pools allow providers to redeem their LP tokens at any time without interference, although many may charge a small penalty if you redeem them too soon.</p>
<p>The relationship between LP tokens and the proportional share of a liquidity pool is used most commonly in at least two cases:</p>
<p>There are many other use cases for LP tokens that are emerging on modern DeFi platforms. These include:</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A guarantee that a system will continue to provide data, and that no centralized authority can shut down its services.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Liveness?</h2>
<div>A rise in cryptocurrencies prompted the creation of consensus algorithms. </div>
<div>For distributed systems, liveness means that a protocol is able to exchange messages among nodes, with the nodes successfully coming to a consensus. </div>
<p>This means that a system has liveness guaranteed.</p>
<div>Blockchains are regularly trying to determine which history of transactions is accurate, rather than the messages itself. </div>
<p>Distributed systems have a degree of correctness, and this involves an ordering of transactions. There are two elements involved in this — liveness and safety. </p>
<p>Liveness guarantees that good things will happen eventually, meaning there is no timeframe for these things to happen. </p>
<p>Termination of a distributed computation is one of many examples of liveness. </p>
<p>Liveness is the guarantee that all validators will reach some consensus on a value. </p>
<p>This can be thought of as the guarantee that no two validators will be in disagreement and reach different values. ‍</p>
<p>Conversely, safety is a guarantee that nothing bad will happen. </p>
<div>For example, Bitcoin's use of the Nakamoto Consensus means that there is an emphasis on liveness on Bitcoin's blockchain. </div>
<div>Nakamoto Consensus uses Proof-of-Work mining along with a metric called “longest chain wins” to determine which history is accurate. </div>
<p>The history and the expected history will be the same if nodes were honest. </p>
<p>A node which is a copy of the ledger operated by a participant of the blockchain network should not show different values when compared to another node. </p>
<p>Two nodes yielding different values represents a problem. </p>
<p>Nodes must reach agreement on what the next block should include.</p>

<title>Loan-to-value (LTV)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/loan-to-value-ltv</url>
<file>loan-to-value-ltv.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Used by lenders, loan-to-value (LTV) is the assessment ratio of risk involved while approving a loan. Simply, it is the ratio of the loan's value to the value of the collateral.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Loan-to-value (LTV)?</h2>
<div>LTV is the ratio of the loan's value to the value of collateral. In a typical financial market, credit scores determine the risk involved in a loan. The lower the credit score, the higher the risk for lenders. Instead of credit scores, the crypto lending process offers asset-backed loans.</div>
<p>Loan to value (LTV) determines the amount of cryptocurrency one would need as collateral before one could get a loan. The lender holds on to this collateral until the loan is fully paid back. </p>
<p>The main benefit of LTV in crypto lending is that it helps minimize the risk on the lender's part. The user also benefits from LTV in that they can access larger loans at lesser interest rates. </p>
<h2>How to Calculate LTV?</h2>
<div>Case 1: When borrowing a crypto-backed loan, you calculate the loan-to-value (LTV) as follows:</div>
<p></p>
<p>Your LTV would be 50% if you borrowed $5,000 and deposited $10,000 worth of bitcoin. However, if the value of bitcoin fell, your collateral's value would decrease, increasing your ratio. To get your loan back to its original LTV ratio, if your LTV rises too high, you might need to put up extra collateral.</p>
<div>Case 2: Once your loan is active, you can continue to monitor your LTV using the following formula:</div>
<h2>Benefits of Loan-to-Value in Crypto Lending</h2>
<p>In traditional collateral-based lending, LTV is a measure of the risk on the investor's side. The higher the LTV, the higher the lender's risk and, consequently, the higher the interest rate for the borrower. In crypto-backed loans, the LTV ensures full repayment in time, thus reducing the investor's risks. If the borrower fails to pay back their loan for whatever reason, part of the collateral is sold to offset the loan. </p>
<div>As a borrower, your LTV ratio is your way of determining your own risk. Depending on your platform of choice, your LTV risk can range anywhere between 5% and 70%. A lower LTV provides you with a safety bag. If the market falls, your assets will not likely be liquidated. A higher LTV, on the other hand, means that you have to think fast in case of extraordinary market situations because your collateral is likely to be liquidated to settle your loan.</div>

<title>Location Swap</title>

<file>location-swap.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Location swap allows the change of claim to the assets manifested in the form of a token with no effect on other attributes.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Location Swap?</h2>
<div>When digital assets on blockchain have a physical backing, we call them asset-backed tokens. These tokens are just a claim to the real physical good, whose properties are described in the tokens. These can be things like the qualities and dimensions of a commodity, as well as its current storage location. If two such assets are exactly the same in every aspect except their current storage location, then swapping one token with the other means that the holder simply changed the physical location from which they can redeem the asset. This is called a location swap. </div>
<p>The physical goods (the &quot;asset-backing&quot;) are not affected by the swap; they stay where they are. Only the claim to these assets manifested in the form of a token changes hands. A location swap makes sense in a global economy where it can cut transportation costs and avoid product shortages by better utilizing goods that are already at the target location, but not needed immediately by their current owner. </p>
<p>The Suez Canal blockage of 2021 saw global trade taking a hit of up to $6bn to $10bn, and highlighted the tight scheduling, interconnectedness, and international reliance on global supply chains. In a token economy, a location swap of goods that are already in a warehouse, but not needed in the short term, can be easily done with the goods in transit at a premium. If the premium is lower than the risk of running out of goods, for example, raw materials in a production line, then both parties of the location swap will profit.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Long Position?</h2>
<div>Long positions are where an investor gains exposure to cryptocurrency with the expectation that prices will rise at a later date, meaning that the asset can be sold for a profit.</div>
<div>It is the opposite of a short position. Here, traders believe that a digital asset is going to depreciate in the near future, and they use strategies to try and capitalize on this downturn.</div>
<p>Indeed, some crypto enthusiasts have entered into long positions without even realizing it, after forgetting that they owned BTC for several years.</p>
<p>In some cases, long and short positions can be utilized without a crypto trader needing to physically own the cryptocurrency in question.</p>
<div>This is the case on derivative platforms where financial instruments such as options and futures are offered. Both types of contract have become increasingly popular in recent years as the crypto markets matured.</div>
<p>Long positions are more common among investors and cryptocurrency traders when compared with short positions. </p>
<div>This is because more traders want to take advantage of bullishness in crypto prices for fear of missing out. </div>
<div>If indicators suggest prices are about to rise, then market participants can purchase their chosen cryptocurrency on an exchange.</div>
<div>Traders usually decide to go long on digital assets due to major developments reinforcing confidence in blockchain and digital assets. </div>
<p>For example, BTC rose above its 2017 all-time high for the first time in November 2020. </p>
<div>The year saw many traders flocking to cryptocurrencies amid a backdrop of increased institutional interest, and some investors saw digital assets as a way to hedge against stock market volatility. </div>
<div>Meanwhile, PayPal introduced a new crypto service that allows its users to buy, hold and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.</div>
<div>These fundamental factors can be crucial in the decision-making process for those who opt to go long.</div>

<title>Longing (Long Position)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/longing-long-position</url>
<file>longing-long-position.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A long position (longing) refers to the situation where an investor buys a cryptocurrency or any other financial instrument to sell it later when the price goes high.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is Longing in Crypto?</h2>
<p>Let us suppose you expect Bitcoin’s value to go high for a given time, so you buy it. You are longing Bitcoin.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<div>It means that you expect Bitcoin to rise in value — a lot. You are expecting a major gain by holding that coin. It is a bullish approach, and professional traders often adopt it when the market is expected to make or continue a bullish move. It is also practiced in markets belonging to other asset classes, including stocks and securities.</div>
<h2>Shorting vs. Longing in Crypto</h2>
<div>These two terms reflect the belief of a trader about the rise or fall in the value of a cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>Cryptocurrency trading has some very complex or industry-specific jargon that’s not understood by naive crypto traders. Although shorting and longing are used quite often and aren’t among the most technical terms. Both define the basic elements (activities) on which the whole idea of trading is based.</p>
<div>In a short position, crypto traders expect a decrease in the price from a given point and sell the cryptocurrency, they “go short” or hold a short position. On the other hand, when crypto traders expect an increase in the price from a given point, they buy that coin/token (or “go long”).</div>
<p>It is possible to go long or short on cryptocurrency using derivatives exchanges without actually buying or selling on spot markets.</p>
<div>Long positions exceed short positions in a bullish market, as crypto traders seek to benefit from price ascension. While you’ll see more short positions when the market is bearish. However, this trend is only an observation. It is quite common for professional traders and investors to buy the dips and sell when the prices go high again. However, these positions, especially in Futures, impose liquidation risks on traders. Therefore, it is advised to do research before taking such risks.</div>
<h2>When to Open a Long Position?</h2>
<div>Ideally, crypto traders should go long when they expect an increase in the price. However, it is important to predict and decide to go long based on technical analysis done by experts. Traders may also take support of some fundamental analysis (basics) by being active on social media platforms, engaging in communities of crypto experts, and following crypto news regularly comprehend the market sentiment, and make the final decision.</div>
<div>There are several exchanges and trading platforms where you can go long or short on cryptocurrencies. Apart from spot markets, you can also hold both long and short positions in Futures markets on multiple crypto trading platforms. One of the most famous trading exchanges is Binance, where millions of traders are involved in such trades on a daily basis.</div>

<h2>What Is Lovelace?</h2>
<p>0.000001 ADA = Lovelace</p>
<p>ADA has six decimal places and its smallest unit (0.000001 ADA) is called Lovelace.</p>
<p>The name Lovelace is a homage to Ada Lovelace who was a gifted mathematician – also considered to be the first computer programmer. Ada Lovelace was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England. Lovelace met Charles Babbage in 1833. Babbage invented the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine, two of the first classes of engines. </p>
<p>In 1843, Babbage asked Lovelace to translate an article about his invention, written by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea. Lovelace added extensive notes to her translation, which described how codes could be created for the machine to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. Her notes also included an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the machine.</p>
<p>The Cardano coin, ADA, is also named after Ada Lovelace. </p>
<div>Charles Hoskinson (one of the co-founders of IOHK) chose to name the token ADA in tribute to Ada Lovelace because he believes that she was the first person to recognize that computers weren’t just about calculating but were also capable of efficient functioning, something we now refer to as algorithms.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Mainnet?</h2>
<div>A mainnet is an independent blockchain running its own network with its own technology and protocol.</div>
<div>It is a live blockchain where its own cryptocurrencies or tokens are in use, as compared to a testnet or projects running on top of other popular networks such as Ethereum.</div>
<div>Programmers use testnet to troubleshoot and trial any new features on a blockchain.</div>
<p>So, the main difference between testnets and mainnets is that the former is a blockchain project that is in progress, while the latter involves a completely developed blockchain.</p>
<p>A few crucial steps may take place before the mainnet stage.</p>
<p>These can include a token sale, giving a product the funding to produce and test features.</p>
<p>Once this phase is successfully implemented, the mainnet stage is usually rolled out.</p>
<p>This would represent that the blockchain is fully up and running.</p>
<p>Several blockchain startups opted to use their own tokens pegged to the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>These were ERC-20 tokens which are intended to be used solely on Ethereum’s platform.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the ICO, the mainnet will be released.</p>
<p>This normally will be represented with a native token rather than the ERC-20.</p>
<p>The next stage in the process is known as mainnet swap.</p>
<p>This involves a swap between the ERC-20 tokens in return for the new coins on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Once the mainnet swap is completed, the new coins will normally be destroyed.</p>
<p>This is to ensure rather than old coins, only the new coins will be used.</p>

<title>Mainnet Swap</title>

<file>mainnet-swap.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Mainnet swap refers to the shift of a cryptocurrency project from one blockchain network to another (which in most cases is its own native blockchain network).</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Mainnet Swap?</h2>
<div>Mainnet swap is the migration of a cryptocurrency project from a third-party blockchain network, such as Ethereum, to its native blockchain network. </div>
<div>A third-party blockchain network is used when a cryptocurrency project is in its testnet phase. But once it moves from the testnet phase to the mainnet phase, users receive native cryptocurrency in exchange for their third-party tokens. That’s why it is also called token migration or token swap. At its core, the mainnet swap is the exchange of third-party tokens with the platform’s native cryptocurrency. </div>
<h2>Better Understand Mainnet Swap</h2>
<div>Since 2017, ELF has been held as an Ethereum based ERC-20 token. After spending considerable time testing the security and reliability of its platform, they announced the mainnet swap on September 9, 2021. Typically, the mainnet swap follows a 1:1 ratio. Once it is completed on the entire blockchain, the remaining tokens are burned. </div>
<div>Another example of a mainnet swap is BNB (Binance Coin). When Binance Chain was in its testnet phase, it was using the Ethereum based ERC-20 BNB token. However, after the mainnet launch, ERC-20 BNB token holders were encouraged to migrate to the BEP2 BNB coin (the native coin of Binance). This swap occurred at a 1:1 ratio, meaning 1 BEP2 BNB coin equaled 1 ERC-20 BNB. </div>
<h2>When Does Mainnet Swap Occur?</h2>
<p>Typically, a mainnet swap occurs when a cryptocurrency project moves from one blockchain to another or migrates its tokens from a third-party blockchain to its native chain. However, the mainnet swap isn’t associated exclusively with new blockchains. A project may announce it if it decides to move from one protocol to another. One example would be the migration of tokens from Bitcoin-based protocol to Ethereum network.</p>
<p>When it comes to the specifics of a mainnet swap’s execution, it varies from project to project. The majority of projects give a deadline to users for the migration of tokens. Failing to do so means you will end up losing access to your tokens as they’re usually burned after the given deadline.</p>
<h2>How Is the Swap Done?</h2>
<p>Depending on the main features of execution, users can either manually swap their tokens or leave them to the platform. For example, Binance allowed users to leave their previously issued tokens on their accounts, so the platform could automatically swap their tokens with native tokens. </p>

<preview>The Maker Protocol allows users to leverage their assets as collateral that are approved by the Maker governance in order to get rewarded with DAI.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Maker Protocol (MakerDAO)?</h2>
<div>The Maker Protocol is a decentralized credit system on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers a fully-collateralized stablecoin, Dai, and attempts to minimize volatility through a system of incentives and penalties.</div>
<h2>MakerDAO Explained</h2>
<p>Maker Protocol comprises:</p>
<div>The Single-Collateral Dai (SCD) system locks ETH as collateral in smart contracts called Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs). This collateral is then used as a buffer to generate DAI.</div>
<p>The Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) system expands the set of assets that can be used as collateral beyond ETH.</p>
<p>On Nov. 15, 2019, an announcement was made to migrate assets from SAI to DAI with a complete shut down of SAI. Read more!</p>
<p>In the protocol, users lock collateral into smart contracts that generate Dai in proportion to the value of their collateral. The smart contract can be &quot;closed&quot; at any time by paying back the generated Dai plus a stability fee.</p>
<p>If any user's collateral falls below the required minimum level (called the liquidation ratio), then their collateral will be auctioned off to restore it to its proper value. In this way, all users are incentivized to maintain their collateral above the required level.</p>
<div>In addition to stability through the use of a Target Rate feedback mechanism, the protocol also adds liquidation methods that minimize the risk of a black swan event.</div>
<div>MKR is the governance token of the Maker Protocol, which backs and stabilizes the value of the Dai stablecoin. MKR holders are able to vote on changes to the protocol, including adjustments to stability fees or risk parameters. MKR holders also have the ability to create new Dai by burning MKR or destroy Dai by issuing more MKR. Maintaining appropriate levels of Dai in circulation at all times is paramount for its role as a decentralized stablecoin.</div>
<p>Dai is a decentralized stablecoin and is soft-pegged to the USD. As a user, you can hold Dai in your cryptocurrency wallet by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults. MakerDAO’s token Dai has a steady value of 1 USD. </p>
<p>Recently, MakerDAO moved to fully decentralization, mitigating the need for a middle man. MakerDAO combines loans with a stable currency, allowing borrowers to predict the amount they’ll have to pay back.</p>
<p>With over 400 applications and services allowing Dai on their platforms, MakerDAO has a huge and thriving ecosystem. You’d be surprised to know that MakerDAO remains the longest-running Ethereum blockchain-based project.</p>

<h2>What Is Malware?</h2>
<div>Malware or malicious software refers to harmful programs utilized by bad actors to illegally access and/or compromise a computer, network or server. These programs are effective tools used by attackers to steal sensitive information from other systems or sabotage them.</div>
<p>Malware programs are classified into nine different categories; the most common ones are worms, viruses, and trojans. Computer viruses are the most rampant type of malware as they are effective in altering and infecting sensitive files within a device. </p>
<p>Worms have gained prominence through the advent of email systems, and are quite destructive due to their self-replicating design, which makes them nearly impossible to neutralize. Moreover, they have the unique ability to take over a whole computer system or network without intervention from end-users. </p>
<p>Trojans are generally a hacker’s weapon of choice, which they primarily plant strategically on websites or send via malicious emails to gain access to other people’s computer systems. Trojans can easily compromise data or spy on a user’s activity once they have infected a device.</p>
<div>Unlike traditional networks, blockchain systems are extremely difficult if not impossible for malware programs to infect thanks to their distributed nature. However, malicious individuals do not have to hack a blockchain to steal money from their users. They usually infiltrate a user’s device and steal their private keys or crypto exchange credentials.</div>
<p>Therefore, crypto users should install reliable anti-virus software and regularly update it to the latest version. Furthermore, it is best to steer clear of questionable websites and never click on attachments or links from emails you don’t recognize.</p>

The two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other are communicating or sharing information with a third party, making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway. The perpetrator must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. In most cases it is easy; for example, an unencrypted WIFI can be used by an attacker to place himself as a middle man in a conversation. MITM attacks are a tactical means to an end to stealing, for example, login credentials or personal information like a private key, spy on the victim, or sabotage communications or corrupt data. encryption can help protect against MITM. However, successful attackers will either reroute traffic to phishing sites designed to look legitimate or simply pass on traffic to its intended destination once harvested or recorded, meaning detection of such attacks is incredibly difficult. </div>
<div>As MITMs try to avoid mutual authentication, it can only succeed when the perpetrator successfully impersonates each endpoint sufficiently enough to make them believe. Endpoint authentication is used by Most cryptographic protocols in an attempt to prevent MITM attacks. For example, TLS can authenticate one or both parties using a mutually trusted certificate of trust. A man-in-the-middle Attack (MITM) should not be confused with meet-in-the-middle Attack.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Margin Call?</h2>
<p>An investor’s margin account is made up of assets purchased with borrowed funds.</p>
<div>It is typically a combination of the cryptocurrency trader’s personal money and borrowed money.</div>
<p>The broker will then demand that the investor deposit additional money or securities to meet the minimum required maintenance amount to continue trading.</p>
<p>A margin call is normally enforced when funds are at risk of running out, particularly due to a losing trade.</p>
<p>A trader can add money to the account to avoid having to close the position. If adding funds to the account is not a viable option, then closing the position becomes inevitable.</p>
<p>The brokerage can do this without obtaining consent from the trader. </p>
<p>Traders can also sometimes calculate the exact amount to which an asset must fall in order for a margin call to be executed.</p>
<p>They can use stop orders to reduce their risk exposure and prevent margin calls from being triggered.</p>
<p>Stop orders is an instruction to buy or sell an asset on a trading venue, including cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<div>They are designed to prevent huge losses during times of excess swings and wild volatility.</div>

<h2>What Is Margin Trading?</h2>
<div>Margin trading can be relatively risky for inexperienced traders who may receive a margin call if the market moves in the opposite direction of their trades.</div>
<div>Margin Bear is the name of the position a trader takes when going “short” on margin.</div>
<p>Conversely, margin bull is the name of the position a trader takes when going long on margin.</p>
<p>Margin trading enables cryptocurrency traders to take much bigger positions and buy bigger amounts of cryptocurrencies that would have not been possible in the absence of margin trading.</p>
<p>Traders who wish to trade with margin require a margin account.</p>
<p>Trading under normal circumstances requires a regular cash account.</p>
<p>Margin amounts vary. A trader can borrow as little as 10% of the cryptocurrency position or more.</p>

<h2>What Is the Market?</h2>
<p>A market is a place where buyers and sellers get together.</p>
<div>In the case of cryptocurrencies, this would involve buyers and sellers of digital assets.</div>
<p>Markets determine the price of a cryptocurrency or asset in question.</p>
<div>Typically, the more buyers and sellers, the more liquid a market is.</div>
<p>The same holds for a perfectly competitive market. One of the key characteristics of perfect competition is high levels of liquidity and transactions.</p>
<p>The price is set by supply and demand. Sellers determine the supply, meanwhile buyers determine demand.</p>
<p>A perfectly competitive market has diminished ability to charge prices at a discount or a premium.</p>
<p>The balance and supply and demand can be disrupted by other variables. These include technological innovation, regulation among other factors.</p>
<p>The most liquid market in the world is the forex market.</p>
<div>The cryptocurrency market is considered to be highly volatile.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Are Market Balances?</h2>
<div>Market balances refer to the outstanding amount of tokens or coins after a trade has been made on a decentralized exchange (DEX).</div>
<div>In traditional finance, market orders are fulfilled at the best available current price and are some of the most common order types filled in the market requiring an intermediary, such as a broker or trading exchange/app to fulfill them. They occur at an asset's current bid price for sell orders and the current ask price for buy orders.</div>
<div>In decentralized finance (DeFI), this can be done without a middleman via a DEX, through liquidity pools either on chain or via automated market makers (AMMs), significantly reducing intermediary fees. </div>
<div>Users and traders simply need to connect their digital wallets (such as MetaMask) to the decentralized exchange, input the amount of an asset (i.e. $USDC) they wish to trade for another asset (for example, $RIN), approve the transaction, and pay a small liquidity provider and gas fee and receive the amount of $RIN dictated by the market price. </div>
<p>For example, if the market price was currently at $2 per $RIN, a market order of 100 USDC at the same time would give the trader approximately 50 $RIN tokens, excluding transaction and liquidity provider fees.</p>
<div>Once the market order is processed, the $50 RIN tokens would appear under market balances in the DEX, requiring the user to settle any outstanding balances or funds and claim them back into their digital wallet.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Market Capitalization/Market Cap/MCAP?</h2>
<p>Often dubbed market cap, this illustrates the collective value of a cryptocurrency when all of the coins are added together.</p>
<p>It is often used as a benchmark of the popularity and desirability of certain cryptocurrencies.</p>
<div>CoinMarketCap calculates market cap by using volume weighted average of prices from multiple exchanges.</div>
<p>Market cap is calculated by multiplying a single coin's price by the number of coins in circulation.</p>
<div>This means a market cap can be very volatile just like the price of a cryptocurrency and fluctuate on an hourly basis.</div>
<p>Large-cap cryptocurrencies that boast a market cap of greater than $10 billion are considered to be safer cryptocurrency investments. This is not to say that they are not volatile. </p>
<p>Some say large-cap cryptocurrencies can even hold some safe haven status, but critics disagree with this.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Market Maker and a Market Taker?</h2>
<div>A successful trade in any securities market requires two parties: a maker and a taker. The maker places an order (to buy or sell at a quoted price), while a taker accepts that placed order (to execute the buy or sell at the quoted price). This is the basic completion of a market trade: someone makes an offer, and someone else takes it.</div>
<p>Crypto exchanges, including early DEXs, followed the traditional order book model to manage markets, which displayed all the buy and sell orders placed by makers for takers to take.</p>
<p>Market makers are important as they provide liquidity and depth to markets, hoping to profit from the spread difference between bids and asks or from predicted price entries during market volatility. Market takers need this liquidity and immediacy to enter or exit positions.</p>
<p>Because of the different motivations for makers and takers — makers seek profits from volatility or bid/ask spread differences while takers require instant exits or entries — there are often many more makers than takers in a market. Makers also tend to trade more frequently and at higher volumes than takers.</p>
<p>Many centralized exchanges themselves are market makers, providing their own liquidity and depth to markets to attract takers — visible through order books. This then leads to increased trading volume and liquidity, which tends to attract even more makers to provide their own liquidity. </p>
<p>The success of this model was key to explaining the difficulties of early decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in attracting liquidity on decentralized markets. Without enough makers to provide liquidity and depth, there simply wasn’t enough volume or good prices that takers would find attractive to trade. Without takers, there was no incentive for makers to provide liquidity when they could easily offload it elsewhere on centralized markets.</p>
<div>While order book DEXs eventually found traction by providing niche markets for alternative cryptocurrencies, especially ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum platform, modern DEXs implemented the automated market maker (AMM) model to overcome this Catch-22 liquidity issue. </div>

<h2>What Is a Market Order/Market Buy/Market Sell?</h2>
<div>A purchase or sale of a cryptocurrency on an exchange at the current best available price.</div>
<p>Market orders are filled as buyers and sellers are willing to trade.</p>
<div>This is in contrast with limit orders at which a cryptocurrency is sold only at a specified price.</div>
<p>Market order requests are usually made through a broker on behalf of investors.</p>
<p>Market orders are considered the most popular form of orders.</p>
<div>This is because they are highly liquid.</div>
<p>They are also said to be very cost effective.</p>
<p>Certain brokerages have a buy/sell button which facilitates market orders.</p>
<p>If a trader is willing to execute a market order that means he or she is agreeing to sell at the bid price or purchase at the asking price.</p>
<p>Market orders are very different orders compared with limit orders. The main difference between both is that limit orders are used by cryptocurrency traders to buy crypto assets when a certain price is reached. </p>
<p>This is a very useful strategy especially if cryptocurrency traders expect prices to drop.</p>
<p>These are often used if traders want to open a long cryptocurrency position.</p>
<div>It may be useful for cryptocurrency traders to look at bid-offer spreads before entering a market order.</div>
<p>This is because a tighter spread reflects greater liquidity and a more competitive market.</p>
<div>Market orders are also instant. Once it is executed, a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is immediately sold or bought at the specific price.</div>
<p>Once the transaction is completed, one can say the “order has been filled”.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of market orders is that it can adversely affect more price sensitive traders.</p>
<p>For example, traders who agree to a higher price may see the market order being filled as the exchange is trying to match the best possible price.</p>

<h2>What Is a Market Signal?</h2>
<p>When we discuss market signals, we are speaking about an unintentional or passive passage of information or an indication between participants of a market. For example, iIf a firm issues bonds, it indirectly shows that it needs capital and wants to retain control.</p>
<p>Note that a market signal is based on technical indicators and usually is a sign of when to sell or buy a specific product. It also brings to the attention of users the other options that are available, which leads to abnormal growth as well as short-term interests.</p>
<p>Through signaling, market participants are essentially creating a volatile market which can help to point out the opportunities to the investors and signal them if they disappear. Keep in mind that not every company markets a static environment.</p>
<p>We also have what is known as a trade signal, which can be seen as a trigger to buy or sell a security based on predetermined criteria. These signals can also be used to reconstitute a portfolio as well as shift sector allocations or take new positions. Traders have the ability to create trading signals using a variety of criteria, from simple ones,such as earning reports as well as volume surges, to complex signals that are derived using existing signals.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Developed by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), Marlowe is an easy-to-use programming language for experts with no programming expertise or knowledge.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Marlowe?</h2>
<p>Marlowe is a programming language for financial contracts, designed to make it easy for non-programmers to write financial contracts, such as derivatives, loans, and other agreements. It also makes it easier for programmers to formally verify these contracts are correct.</p>
<div>The project was initiated by Input-Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the blockchain research and development company behind Cardano.  </div>
<div>Marlowe is part of IOHK's efforts to bring formal methods to smart contract programming, but it differs from previous approaches by being designed specifically for use in financial applications. To achieve this, its designers studied finance theory, particularly the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist, Kenneth Arrow, who pioneered much of the mathematical thinking behind modern finance. This resulted in a set of built-in abstractions based on real-world financial concepts, such as time and money, rather than more generic concepts like lists, functions, and variables found in other programming languages.</div>
<p>Marlowe is based on a theory of financial contracts that have been formalized in the Isabelle theorem prover. This gives it several unique features not found in other contract languages:</p>
<p>The ability to reason about the expected value of contracts.</p>
<p>The ability to formally verify properties of contracts.</p>
<p>In addition, Marlowe contracts can be executed on the Cardano blockchain. Users can try it live on Playground, which allows users to model and execute contracts without any knowledge of blockchain technology or smart contracts.</p>
<p>Marlowe was designed to be a simple and powerful tool for financial modeling. Its syntax has been kept as simple as possible so that both programmers and non-programmers can use it.</p>
<p>Marlowe can be used for a number of things, but it is particularly suited to the following:</p>
<p>Building interactive financial contracts</p>
<p>Defining games and protocols for decision-making processes</p>
<p>Simulating business processes, such as those involving finance or insurance</p>
<p>Modeling financial markets</p>
<p>Exploring ideas in game theory</p>
<p>It works in a sandbox environment, allowing all kinds of developers to write smart contracts on Cardano. </p>
<p>Currently, Marlowe will run on Cardano, but it’s not tied to Cardano only. In the future, it can be used to write smart contracts on other blockchains as well.</p>

<h2>What Are Masternodes?</h2>
<div>Masternodes are a server maintained by its owner, somewhat like full nodes, but with additional functionalities such as anonymizing transactions, clearing transactions, and participating in governance and voting.</div>
<div>A node is a computing device which aims to validate blocks and transactions.</div>
<div>Masternodes were initially popularized by Dash in 2014 to reward owners of these servers for maintaining a service for the blockchain.</div>
<div>It acts as a second layer to Bitcoin’s blockchain and attempts to take the pressure off nodes.</div>
<p>Considered as full nodes, they perform the core functions that nodes do as well as additional features.</p>
<p>They are rewarded for performing these tasks.</p>
<p>Masternodes were created in response to the problem of a decline in nodes.</p>
<p>Rising costs and technical difficulties that result from running nodes often lead to a reduction in full nodes.</p>
<p>This can be problematic because full nodes can hurt profitability.</p>
<p>It also leads to a reduction in overall efficiency of the system.</p>
<div>The reward masternodes get is similar to the concept of Proof-Of-Work, abbreviated as PoW.</div>
<p>Dash was the first cryptocurrency to incorporate masternodes.</p>
<p>Masternodes facilitate advanced functions such as PrivateSend and InstantSend.</p>
<p>Masternodes are backed by collateral in cash. They receive regular contributions for the work they do.</p>
<p>Masternode operators are able to vote each month on a maximum proportion roughly equivalent to 10% of the block reward to fund projects that contribute to Dash’s development.</p>
<p>Masternodes are considered to be sources of support to blockchain.</p>
<p>For this reason, they are often also dubbed “bond validator systems.”</p>
<p>Masternodes are increasingly important as they prevent congestion of blockchain systems as well as aim to reduce transaction processing time.</p>

<h2>What Is Max Supply?</h2>
<div>Max supply is the best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the cryptocurrency.</div>
<div>Once the maximum supply is exhausted, no new coins or tokens will be produced or mined.</div>
<p>Most cryptocurrencies come with a maximum supply.</p>
<p>Usually, the maximum supply is determined by the limits outlined by each underlying protocol of every digital asset.</p>
<p>In the case of Bitcoin, the maximum supply is fixed at 21 million coins. </p>
<p>Not all cryptocurrencies have a predetermined fixed supply, and one of them is Ether. </p>
<p>Maximum supply is a different concept from total supply. Maximum supply is calculated by adding the total amount of coins that have been mined with those that have yet to be mined.</p>
<div>In contrast total supply is calculated by subtracting the number of coins that have been lost from the amount that have been mined.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Medium of Exchange?</h2>
<p>A medium of exchange can be seen as an intermediary instrument or system that is used to facilitate a sale, purchase or even trade of goods between parties. </p>
<p>Throughout modern economies, the medium of exchange is currency, and if money as represented by a currency becomes no longer viable as a medium of exchange, or if the monetary units cannot be accurately valued, the consumers end up losing the ability to plan budgets and there's no way to gauge demand with accuracy.</p>
<p>Now, using a medium of exchange will allow greater efficiency in an economy, and it will lead to an increase in the overall trading activity.</p>
<p>When we look at a traditional barter system, trade between two parties only occurs when one party has a commodity that another party wants, or the other way around. When it comes to the chance of this happening at the same time as a cross occurrence, where each of the parties desires something that the other one has, it is improbable. </p>
<p>With a medium of exchange, however, think along the lines of gold. If one party had something that they want to exchange with another party, for example, if you had a laptop, but were in the market for a gaming computer, you could sell your laptop for gold, and then use that gold to purchase a gaming computer. This gold example would be inefficient by today’s standards, but it shows you what a medium of exchange can do to facilitate trades in a marketplace.</p>
<p>Money as a medium of exchange enables anyone who possesses it to participate as an equal market player. When customers end up using money to purchase an item or a service, they are effectively making a bid in response to the asking price, and this interaction creates order and predictability within the marketplace, as producers know what to produce, as well as how much to charge, while the consumers can reliably plan their budgets around the predictable as well as stable pricing models.</p>

<title>Megahashes Per Second</title>

<file>megahashes-per-second.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Megahashes per second (MH/s) is a unit of measurement that equals one million hashes per second.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Megahashes Per Second?</h2>
<div>A hash is a mathematical application that converts any collection of data into letters and numbers of a predetermined length. Because hashes are frequently shorter and easier to find, they are employed to speed up the storage and retrieval of data.</div>
<div>This calculation is employed in the mining process, which involves the use of powerful computers and carefully specialized software to create a cryptocurrency. Miners are expected to answer intricate mathematical problems, some of which are extremely difficult to solve by hand. </div>
<div>These calculations are measured in hash rates like MH/s, which is the speed at which any mining device performs. MH/s is equivalent to one million (1,000,000) hashes. Because bitcoin mining is essentially a guessing game that requires speed, each mining equipment makes hundreds or even millions of guesses per second. The purpose is to solve the current block by finding the right response to the question.</div>
<div>The truth is that, as difficulty rates have risen, solo mining a single block on a single CPU at 50 hashes per second would take three-quarters of a million years. That is why no one in their right mind would mine bitcoin with a CPU.</div>
<div>A slew of new and more powerful mining hardware, such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, has entered the market, boosting miners' earnings. However, as the complexity of mining increases, computers need more energy. As a result, the percentage of electricity consumed rises.</div>
<div>Another interesting aspect is that hash rates differ based on the cryptocurrency and the mining machine or equipment employed. The amount of hash power used by different cryptocurrencies varies.</div>
<div>Cryptocurrency miners are directly affected by hash rates. A higher hash rate increases the likelihood of mining a block. Miners have a better probability of getting block rewards from successfully mined blocks when the rate is at its highest.</div>
<div>Anyone familiar with computer data storage concepts will recognize the terms used to express hash rates, some of which include Mega, Giga, and Tera.</div>
<div>A hash rate of 60 hashes per second, for example, means that the device can compute and make 60 guesses per second in an attempt to solve a block.</div>
<div>The kilohash (KH/s) is one step ahead, followed by megahash (MH/s), gigahash (GH/s), tera(TH/s), and peta(PH/s). This is how the hash rates are determined:</div>
<p>Kilohash = 1,000 hashes</p>
<p>Megahash = 1,000 kilohashes</p>
<p>The majority of recent Ethereum mining machines (mostly GPUs) run using the megahash range.</p>
<div>Let's take a closer look at Ethereum mining, for example, around 50 megahashes per second can be achieved with a good GPU. Some people accomplish more, while others get less. Seven GPUs are used in many Ethereum mining setups. We should expect to earn just over 10 Ether each year if we assume that all seven GPUs run at the same speed.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Meme Economy?</h2>
<div>Meme Economy is a satirical notion and online subculture in which memes are addressed in financial language as if they were commodities or capital assets with varying prices. It has generated a number of spin-off ventures built around the fake meme market infrastructure since its creation as a Reddit sub, /r/memeEconomy, in 2016.</div>
<h2>What Is /r/memeEconomy?</h2>
<p>/r/memeEconomy is a Reddit “subreddit” dedicated to memes. As the name implies, the group combines memes and economics in an ideal way. Memes are portrayed as a possible investment on the subreddit, with members able to &quot;invest&quot; in them depending on their likelihood of becoming a top meme on the platform.</p>
<div>What's the catch, then? Is it possible to make money by generating dank memes? No, not at all. You can earn as many memecoins as you want, but that's about it. Although some new members of the community may accuse the meme community of taking itself far too seriously, the subreddit is a satirical take on how real-world financial markets work. The fact that the subreddit's automatic bot has its own GitHub page demonstrates this.</div>
<p>The subreddit's business model, on the other hand, is rather obvious. If someone discovers a relatively new meme with a few upvotes, they may invest their memecoins in it and expect it to go viral, resulting in maximum profits. This expectation also corresponds to the psychological pleasure derived from a meme when it is still new on the internet. It becomes a dead meme as soon as it becomes popular, and the person who shared it runs the danger of slipping down the meme social ladder.</p>
<h2>What Is NASDANQ?</h2>
<p>Darkpitt registered the site NASDANQ.com on September 29th, 2016, and announced ambitions to transform it into a meme trade marketplace on the /r/MemeEconomy subreddit. On February 22nd, 2017, Redditor AchillesDev, one of the NASDANQ project's volunteer developers, posted an update revealing that the team has officially formed a company under the name NASDANQ LLC and the alpha version of the platform would be ready for launch within two weeks, with basic functionality such as buying and selling memes and setting firms. NASDANQ started its closed beta on April 12th, 2017, giving testers access to the site's basic functionalities. Icedog68, a Redditor, shared a snapshot of his site profile that day.</p>

<h2>What Is a Memecoin?</h2>
<div>Memecoin is the crypto analog of memes and came into being as a cheaper Bitcoin substitute. The first memecoin, named Dogecoin, was based on the famous Shiba Inu meme. Apart from Dogecoin, some of the most popular memecoins include Dogelon Mars, Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, and Samoyedcoin</div>
<h2>The Memecoin Boom</h2>
<p>Similar to its theme, memecoins used to be taken as a joke in the world of crypto trading. However, endorsement by Elon Musk gave it an unanticipated boost. The value of Dogecoin shot up overnight when Musk started tweeting about the crypto asset.</p>
<p>Besides Musk, Snoop Dogg and Mark Cuban have also expressed interest in the memecoin, making it popular among the community. </p>
<div>Within a few months, the memecoin secured its place in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. By the end of 2021, Shiba Inu, another popular memecoin made its way to the top 10 list. Chief Revenue Officer of Zeb Pay commented on the growing memecoin status:</div>
<p>“The surge in volumes that the token [Shiba Inu] has been witnessing can also be attributed to the FOMO that typically arises as interest peaks, and traders rush to take part in the rally as a means to book profits.’’</p>
<p>Just at the culmination of the GameStop frenzy, traders were eager to find a new obsession. Reddit started booming with memecoin discussions, especially as endorsements from billionaires started coming in. Since its inception in 2013, Dogecoin aimed at dethroning Bitcoin by being less expensive and greater in circulation, having a supply of around a quadrillion coins! </p>
<p>The deVere Group’s CEO, Nigel Green, said:</p>
<p>“In the same way that the GameStop frenzy was pitched as a battle-play of ‘Wall Street versus The Little Guy’, Dogecoin is being pitched as a battle-play against the well-established crypto giants like Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>Another aspect of the memecoin boom is that it is seen as an opportunity by retail investors to make the most out of their small investments because Bitcoin is a bit far-fetched for small investors and many new traders, given its ever-growing value. Memecoins’ faster minting and limitless coin acquisition continue to attract more traders. Earlier this year, Dogecoin surpassed giants such as eBay, Kraft Heinz, and many more in market value. </p>
<h2>Most Popular Memecoins as of 2021</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the top memecoins include:</p>
<p>Dogecoin</p>
<p>Shiba Inu </p>
<p>Dogelon Mars</p>
<p>Samoyedcoin</p>
<p>HogeFinance</p>
<div>You may check the complete list of top memecoins on CoinMarketCap.</div>
<h2>What Do Memecoins Offer?</h2>
<p>As per Nasdaq, memecoins are just a means of making some money but the currency is yet to offer a real-world utility like Ethereum and Bitcoin. If the current endorsement of memecoins by Musk and other influencers continues, the surge may still be able to benefit traders in the short term. While the popularity of the currency continues to increase, memecoins are still a more feasible option for new investors to make small gains. </p>

<title>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</title>

<file>memorandum-of-understanding-mou.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is defined as a written agreement between two or more parties, which is legally-non binding.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)?</h2>
<p>What Is a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)?</p>
<div>It is a written agreement that all the participating parties have a mutual understanding of the matter and agree with one another. It is regarded as the initiating terms of a formal contract. It is widely used in business transactions and personal matters concerning finance and law-related communications.</div>
<h2>How Does a Memorandum of Understanding Work?</h2>
<p>An MoU is an announcement that all the parties in a contract are in unison about moving forward with a contract or venture. It is written with a declaration that the project will be taken to completion in the foreseeable future. </p>
<div>It is considered synonymous with the letter of intent and the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). MoUs are frequently signed confidentially between various international governments, state institutions of a country, and business organizations. </div>
<div>A well-crafted MoU provides a framework that aligns the efforts of all the parties involved in a common direction. This ensures that the intended goal is attained efficiently. It outlines the important principles and instructions that can help bring various parties on the same page. Division of labor between the negotiating parties is simplified before a contract can be signed. This allows the parties to assess the compatibility and efficiency of the plan, without any legal intervention.</div>
<div>Many experts refer to an MoU as an ‘‘agreement before an agreement’’. Each party can communicate the objectives and expectations beforehand. Misinterpretation, queries, and doubts can be addressed in a timely manner.</div>
<h2>Important Things to Notice in a Memorandum of Understanding</h2>
<p>Every MoU should have clear instructions lined up with a mutual understanding of the parties. It should include details that can be used in the future contract. </p>
<p>The foremost thing to notice is the reason and goal of the MoU. It should be consensually decided after elaborate discussions. The agreement of all participants is mandatory. </p>
<p>The date and time of the commencement of the agreement must be exact. If possible, the period of the project and the agreement should be mentioned blatantly so that each party knows there is a time limit. </p>
<p>Details of each party and negotiator, together with their agreed-upon roles should be noted while signing an MoU. Any clash of ideas and roles is addressed timely so that the discord doesn’t creep into the actual contract. </p>
<div>If there are rules and repercussions of backing out from the contract, they should be duly noted and agreed upon by everyone. If anyone goes back on the predetermined terms, the project can suffer huge losses that should be foreseen and discussed. Preferably, the MoU should clearly state if there is space for any of the parties to back out at any given time. </div>
<h2>Benefits of Memorandum of Understanding</h2>
<p>Currently, MoUs are the standard informal agreements signed between governments and various cryptocurrency platforms around the world. They have paved the way for designing frameworks for legalizing blockchain technology. The most recent MoU was signed between the government of Lesotho and Apollo to allow the application of blockchain technology to various government projects. </p>

<title>Mempool</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mempool</url>
<file>mempool.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A mempool is the node's collection of all of the unconfirmed transactions that it has seen.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Mempool?</h2>
<p>A mempool is essentially a cryptocurrency node's mechanism for storing information on unconfirmed transactions, acting as a waiting room for transactions that have not yet been included in a block. </p>
<p>In fact, to submit a transaction to the miners, nodes have to relay it to each other until it has propagated across the entirety of the network. This mempool is the node's holding area for all of the pending transactions.</p>
<p>A mempool is the node's collection of all of the unconfirmed transactions that it has seen, which enables it to decide whether or not to relay a new transaction.</p>
<p>There are as many mempools as there are nodes. This is due to the fact that not all nodes receive the same transactions at the same time, so some nodes store more information than others at a given time. Everyone can run their own node with the hardware that they pick, so all of the nodes have different capacities that can store unconfirmed transactions. The result of this? Each node has its own rendition of the pending transactions, and this explains the variety of the mempool sizes as well as the transaction counts found throughout different sources.</p>
<p>When a node receives a new valid block, it ends up removing all of the transactions which are contained in the block from its mempool, as well as the transactions that have conflicting inputs. This can result in a sharp drop within the mempool size.</p>
<div>There is no financial incentive for running a node, and the hardware that is dedicated to it is often limited. A node's mempool often maxes out its RAM, and when this happens, the node will just crash and restart with an empty mempool throughout older versions of Bitcoin. However, as of the recent updates, if the mempool size gets too close to the RAM capacity, the node sets up a minimal fee threshold, and here, transactions with fees per kB lower than this threshold can immediately be removed from the mempool, and only the new transactions with a fee per kB large enough aren't allowed on it.</div>

<title>Mercenary Capital</title>

<preview>Mercenary capital refers to the opportunistic capital provided by investors seeking to take advantage of the short-term incentive programs conducted by a platform for individual gain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Mercenary Capital?</h2>
<div>Mercenary capital refers to the opportunistic capital provided by investors seeking to take advantage of the short-term incentive programs conducted by a platform for individual gain. It is often short-lived or temporary as these investors often withdraw their capital once they find more profitable programs, or when the rewards provided diminish below their desired targets.
To incentivize small to medium size investors, many AMM platforms conduct a growth hacking program, called liquidity mining and yield farming. Simply put, the program provides extra rewards (often in the form of governance or native tokens to the platform) to liquidity providers (LPs) if the LPs decide to stake or lock in their LP tokens. These rewards vary greatly depending on the projects’ decision, but have historically been attractive enough to attract more investors. </div>
<p>However, platforms implementing such programs are also vulnerable to mercenary capital even with lock-in time periods. This is especially so when the programs provide excessive short-term rewards that benefit opportunists instead of community members and long-term investors. </p>
<p>Other factors, such as a limited time period or temporary bonus for the growth hacking programs, may also increase the negative impact of mercenary capital. When the program ends, short-term selling pressure increases as the mercenary capital providers withdraw their liquidity to sell off their rewards. This results in significant price drops of the reward tokens and might create a chain effect from panic selling by other investors.</p>
<p>While this is an issue all platforms employing growth hacking programs eventually face, it can be crippling to the long-term development of the platform. Measures such as longer lock-in staking periods for more rewards can be employed, but dealing with mercenary capital ultimately boils down to a combination of good tokenomics, excellent products, and strong community trust.</p>

<preview>An online digital wallet that allows users to manage, transfer and receive Ethereum, operating as an extension to a regular browser.</preview>
<description>
<div>MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that operates as a plug-in for standard internet browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.</div>
<div>It allows users to manage, transfer and receive Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens — without the need to download the whole blockchain in the process.</div>
<div>As well as allowing digital coins to be stored, MetaMask also enables users to interact with smart contracts and decentralized applications without using a full Ethereum node.</div>
<p>The cryptocurrency wallet was created in 2016 by ConsenSys, a Brooklyn-based blockchain software company focusing on Ethereum-related tools and infrastructure.</p>
<div>Hot wallets — or web-based wallets — are often considered insecure, with phishing attacks being the main risk for users. These scams are used by hackers to steal sensitive information such as passwords and usernames.</div>
<div>The software uses HD backup settings and relies on a team of developers that regularly update its open source code.</div>
<p>A HD wallet, or hierarchical deterministic wallet, is a next-generation digital wallet that automatically generates a hierarchical tree-like structure of private and/or public addresses. This takes the issue away from the user, as otherwise the key would have to be generated externally.</p>
<p>One of MetaMask’s key features is the use of a 12-word phrase that has to be kept safe or to remembered by the user, as it will be required in the event of forgetting a password.</p>
<p>Due to its success in the cryptocurrency community, the lack of an official mobile website for several years led to malicious actors to develop phishing software that posed as MetaMask’s mobile app.</p>

<preview>A metatransaction executes a transaction signed by another party on behalf of the original signer, ferrying this original transaction onto the public blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Metatransaction? </h2>
<p>A metatransaction is like a butler that executes a transaction signed by another party on behalf of the original signer, ferrying this original transaction onto the public blockchain rather than the person having to do it themselves. Thus, metatransactions remove the complexities and gas cost of execution on public blockchains by letting a relayer network handle these while the user just needs to sign the transaction with one click.</p>
<div>On a public ledger, transactions are signed by the person transacting, and this is received in the mempool, a database of unconfirmed or pending transactions which every node keeps. Here, miners include the signed transaction into the next block. </div>
<p>During this process, the person transacting pays the gas fees, placing all the responsibility on the user completing the transaction. Also, users are required to pay the gas fees in the chain's native token - even when using dApps or protocols which have their own token.</p>
<div>Metatransactions allow dApps to circumvent the burden of gas fees and chain token payments by having the signed transaction live within the standard blockchain transaction. As a result,  the burden of gas fees and transaction completion is placed on the third party. </div>
<div>For example, a dApp developer could see this as a good opportunity to offer a gasless experience and sponsor the gas fees for some or all users to increase user acquisition. They can also choose to allow users only to have their native token to pay for gas. In both scenarios, they would use a metatransaction so they are the ones managing the standard chain transaction and paying the gas fees needed. The user would simply sign what is required and pay according to what the developer designates, in their own token or zero gas fees.</div>
<p>The benefit of metatransactions is a smoother user experience. It takes the difficult and costly aspects of trading on blockchains away from the users and places these responsibilities with the developers or relayer infrastructure already participating on the back end. </p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A metaverse is a digital universe that contains all the aspects of the real world, such as real-time interactions and economies. It offers a unique experience to end-users.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Metaverse?</h2>
<p>A metaverse is simply an alternate version of reality that exists digitally. Much like the physical reality, people interact in this metaverse to work, play, do business, and socialize with other people and elements.</p>
<div>In practice, there are multiple existing metaverses today, and they can be referred to with different names and terms. The concept derives from “meta” which means “beyond” and “universe” which refers to all existing matter and space. So the term, “metaverse”, so to speak, goes beyond all that is visible and known to exist.</div>
<div>In the blockchain and crypto industry, many projects working in other emerging technology, like artificial intelligence, and expanded reality, like VR and AR, create versions of their own digital realities. This is where the term metaverse is often used to describe an ecosystem where users of the platform can find every single element, creation, experience, and interaction in a shared, and most importantly, persistent space.</div>
<p>The concept of metaverse is gaining popularity in big tech companies as well. It is difficult to know its shape in general; however, it can be identified by some or all of these characteristics:</p>
<div>‍‍</div>
<div>Persistence: In the metaverse, a persistent space is continuously shaped with environments that continue to grow and evolve regardless of whether or not users are connected to and interacting with them.</div>
<div>‍Real time: Experiences there happen in real time. This doesn’t necessarily mean live; however, pre-recorded performances can be triggered, for example, but users experience them in real time.</div>
<div>‍Economy: The metaverse has a fully functional economy. It uses a native, blockchain-based currency to buy, sell, or trade products and services in the metaverse.</div>
<div>‍Physical bridge: In augmented reality, the metaverse can exist alongside or even be linked to the physical universe. Think of an additional digital layer on top of or linked to actual geographical coordinates, for example. This is as opposed to virtual reality metaverses that only exist in a virtual realm.</div>
<div>‍Open content: One major pull for metaverses is that the content and experiences within, unlike previous versions of digital universes, can be created by corporations and users together. Users are, in fact, expected to eventually provide the majority of content in a metaverse.</div>

<preview>Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS) is a novel technological solution that anyone can use to build their own metaverses.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS)?</h2>
<p>As technology gradually evolved, businesses and service providers have transitioned from the one-time fee model to a subscription-based model with increasing pace and frequency. Over the years, several unique business models like Saas (software-as-a-service), IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-Service), and PaaS (platform-as-a-service) have stemmed from the XaaS (Anything-as-a-Service) model.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, the concept of “as-a-service” involves delivering technological products and solutions via cloud-based services. For example, instead of setting up their in-house database storage servers, which would come at a high cost, companies employ the pay-as-you-use services offered by third-party service providers, like AWS, Microsoft or Google. In this setup, users gain the benefits of less capital expenditure, more flexibility, and the option to upgrade as needed.</p>
<div>With the emergence of the metaverse - an immersive virtual world powered by blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), and other technological innovations, similar needs have arisen for companies and individuals that wish to participate. However, building a metaverse from scratch requires significant investment and experience with the underlying technology, complicating it for much of the global population.</div>
<div>To solve this problem, blockchain startups have introduced the concept of metaverse-as-a-service (MaaS). Like any other as-a-service model, the service provider will offer the required infrastructure and technology to enable users to build, manage, and maintain their own metaverses. The service provider’s native token will power all accompanying features. The same token will also enable holders to be a part of the network’s governance and allow them to participate in other DeFi primitives.</div>
<div>Take, for instance, the upcoming Bit.Country platform on the Polkadot Network. By design, Bit.Country supplies the application framework and blockchain that anyone can use to build their personal metaverse. Users can also create personalized economies, NFTs, and other products to incentivize their respective communities.</div>
<p>According to Ray Lu, the Founder and CEO of the first MaaS platform Bit.Country and Metaverse.Network, </p>
<p>Think of MaaS as another IT-based service. The notable difference, however, is that there are no centralized entities. Decentralized platforms and open protocols provide the service and the infrastructure. In our case, we have built Bit.Country and Metaverse.Network to empower users to build their own metaverses. Using our MaaS solution, users can implement economic infrastructure, governance, and immersive visual and interactive experience, without any knowledge of blockchain technology.</p>

<preview>Metcalfe’s Law is a way of describing the use of networks and highlights that the more users a network has, the more valuable it is to each individual user.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Metcalfe’s Law?</h2>
<p>Metcalfe's Law was first formulated by George Glider in 1993 and later attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet. Metcalfe had used this law to describe Ethernet connections when the internet got increasingly globalized.</p>
<p>Metcalfe’s Law is a way of describing the use of networks and highlights that the more users a network has, the more valuable it is to each individual user. </p>
<p>An illustration of this law could be seen in the development of telephones. Back when only several people owned a telephone, there was little benefit to owning one yourself. But as more people started owning phones, there now becomes a cost to not owning a phone since you lose out on that interconnected ecosystem.</p>
<p>The concept of Metcalfe’s Law can also similarly be applied to the realm of digital assets. Metcalfe’s Law is mostly applied to big networks filled with discoverable devices that communicate with each other and in that sense: blockchains, markets, digital asset exchanges all meet that description. In that sense, Bitcoin is both simultaneously a network, a market, and a currency which also means that Metcalfe’s Law should apply here. </p>
<p>The adoption rate of Bitcoin and the interface and flows of money across the wider market would therefore affect the price. Metcalfe’s curve could thus be a useful tool to illustrate where the prices of Bitcoin are likely to move in the medium term.</p>

<title>Micro Cap</title>

<file>micro-cap.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A digital asset with a very small market capitalization is referred to as a micro-cap stock/asset/cryptocurrency in the financial sector.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Micro Cap?</h2>
<div>A micro-cap stock is a publicly listed corporation with a market capitalization of $50 million to $300 million. Micro-cap equities are more volatile than large cap companies, making them intrinsically riskier than mid or large caps. </div>
<div>Micro-cap businesses have a higher market valuation than nano-cap companies, but they have a lower market capitalization than small, mid, large, and mega-cap companies. Stock prices for businesses with bigger market capitalizations are not always higher than for companies with lower market caps.</div>
<div>These organizations are popular for their extreme volatility, and they are sometimes seen as riskier than corporations with bigger market capitalizations. The market capitalization of a firm is computed by multiplying the stock price by the total number of shares outstanding.</div>
<div>They are known for being high-risk because many of them have untested goods, no firm history, assets, revenue, or operations. They are also vulnerable to huge price shocks due to a lack of liquidity and a tiny shareholder base.</div>
<div>In the world of cryptocurrencies, the volume of circulating coins available to the public multiplied by the price per coin determines the market capitalization, or overall value, of a cryptocurrency asset and its underlying blockchain firm. There is no particular market cap barrier that indicates that an asset is a large-cap coin as a subjective phrase.</div>
<div>Micro-cap altcoins are similar to penny stocks in that they have a small market capitalization. They have the potential for large payouts, however, there is a risk of losing more than the average coin out there. Because of the extreme volatility, some may consider micro caps to be riskier than penny stocks; nevertheless, if you know how to choose the proper chart (which is more than half the effort), the risk is pretty minimal.</div>
<div>Micro cap crypto ventures frequently try to provide value to their consumers by developing services that are in demand. When you engage in these projects' tokens, you may expect to get a significant return on your investment. They are, however, extremely dangerous investment options.</div>
<div>A disadvantage of microcaps is that while analyzing smaller firms, investors must consider liquidity. There is also less liquidity in the micro-cap markets than in larger-cap equities due to the lack of regular analyst coverage and institutional buying.</div>
<div>Micro-cap coins have the advantage of allowing you to make a lot of money in a short amount of time. If you buy into a micro-cap in its early stage of development, you have the opportunity to earn enormous returns on your initial investment. Being an early investor also implies that you don't have to put a lot of money into a project to make a lot of money.</div>
<div>If you are in it for the long term, investing in micro-cap coins puts you at a larger risk of getting scammed. Also, if you don't complete your due diligence on your favorite currency, you risk losing all of your money if the crypto firm decides to depart the market, taking all of your investment cash with it - also known as a rug pull. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Micropayment?</h2>
<div>A micropayment is essentially a small transaction that is carried out online and can be as small as a fraction of a cent. Now, depending on the payment system, a micropayment can also be defined as any transaction size which is less than $1.00 or more. These have been known as a way to better facilitate the immediate online distribution of royalties, gratuities, pay-per-click advertising, freelance jobs of a smaller scale, as well as cryptocurrency transactions. </div>
<p>When it comes to the term itself, &quot;micropayment&quot; was coined by technology futurist as well as philosopher Ted Nelson throughout the 1960s as a way for individual copyrights on online content.</p>
<p>He had envisioned micropayments in the neighborhood of ten-thousandth of a penny. This small size would in turn allow users to pay for online content and allow for the creation of low-cost networks as well. </p>
<p>When it comes to the platforms built for micropayments, they work in numerous ways.</p>
<p>Once a seller or a payment provider has an established account with a third-party micropayment provider that collects, stores as well as distributes the payments made, using micropayments becomes a possibility. Through a digital wallet that is managed by the provider itself, payments are stored until they actually accumulate to a larger amount, where they are then paid out to the recipient. </p>
<p>Then, you have the method which implements a prepaid system. Here, a user sets up an account with a micropayment processor and pays an average or large sum of money into the account itself.</p>
<p>When the provider is also used by an e-commerce platform where the user can make a small purchase, the user's account with the provider can easily be debited for the dollar amount of the purchase. This means that the user makes payment through a micropayment processing account.</p>

<title>Mid Cap</title>

<file>mid-cap.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Mid cap is a measure derived from a mathematical computation that determines the market value of a cryptocurrency with a market capitalization ranging from $1 billion to $10 billion.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Mid Cap?</h2>
<div>A metric called market cap is used to determine the true worth of a cryptocurrency, and it is usually divided into three categories: large cap, mid cap, and small cap. All digital tokens or coins found in crypto-asset price tracking platforms fit into one of these three types. It is a metric that shows a cryptocurrency's dominance and popularity.</div>
<div>In the crypto world, market capitalization is often calculated by multiplying the number of tokens by their price (total number of tokens x price of a token). We also look at the circulating cap, which is the difference between the total number of tokens in circulation now and the total number that can be created.</div>
<div>By categorizing crypto projects based on their market capitalization, we are essentially categorizing them based on their popularity and risk factor. It demonstrates the level of risk we are dealing with while investing in a cryptocurrency. Project strength, fundamental values, volatility, liquidity, and responsiveness are the underlying factors.</div>
<div>The market capitalization of mid-cap cryptocurrencies and tokens ranges from $1 billion to $10 billion dollars. These initiatives are well-established, expanding, and poised for tremendous expansion in the foreseeable future. PolkaBridge, Litecoin, Monero, and Binance Coin are among the most popular mid-cap currencies and tokens in this category.</div>
<div>Mid cap cryptos have a lesser market cap than their large-cap counterparts, but they have a lot more growth potential. This is due to the fact that some of these are still increasing their market or use cases. However, they can depreciate even further, which is why they are frequently regarded as riskier.</div>
<p>Because mid cap cryptos are not as established as large-cap cryptos, their value can fluctuate.</p>
<div>Mid cap cryptocurrencies, on average, do well over time, and including them in your portfolio is a solid diversification measure. However, keep in mind that not all coins have the potential to become high caps or perform exceptionally in the market.</div>
<div>A mid cap coin might be a decent investment in some situations, but you must do your homework before making an investment. Many mid-cap coins, like MOVR, FLUX, and GALA, have demonstrated strong fundamental growth, however, many of them have likewise vanished from the crypto market altogether.</div>
<div>The market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is an excellent indicator for determining its popularity and domination, however, it isn't the only criterion, though. When selecting a cryptocurrency, other elements to examine are the project's core team, fundamentals, technicals, and value proposition.</div>

<title>MilliBitcoin</title>

<preview>MilliBitcoin, also known as μBTC, is a sub-unit of Bitcoin which is equivalent to the one-thousandth of a BTC, the most famous and valuable cryptocurrency in the world.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is MilliBitcoin?</h2>
<div>MilliBitcoin is a broken-down version of Bitcoin (BTC) which is exactly equal to the one-thousandth part of a BTC. In other words, </div>
<p>1 BTC = 1,000 μBTC.</p>
<p>Therefore, 1 μBTC is about 58.45 USD.</p>
<div>Given that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be mined, Bitcoin earns the distinction of being a deflationary token, implying that its value will rise as it becomes scarce. Bitcoins can be divided down to near-infinite values because they are backed by a code rather than a physical material, such as gold. This enables Bitcoin holders to hold and effectively divide Bitcoin into several units, allowing them to price goods based on their perceived value. However, because it is a store of value, there has recently been an increase in adoption. As the cryptocurrency's value against the US dollar is volatile, and it is not widely accepted as a unit of account, there are currently many terms that each correspond to a sub-unit of Bitcoin. </div>
<div>A satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto released the BTC whitepaper back in October 2008, and the first block was generated in January of the following year. Therefore, the smallest unit has been named after them.</div>
<p>1 Bitcoin = 1,000 μBTC = 100,000,000 satoshi</p>
<p>Units larger than BTC, on the other hand, are:</p>
<p>1daBTC (deca Bitcoin) is equal to 10 BTC</p>
<p>1hBTC (hecto Bitcoin) is equal to 100 BTC</p>
<p>1kBTC (kilo Bitcoin) is equal to 1,000 BTC</p>
<p>1MBTC (mega Bitcoin) is equal to 100,000 BTC</p>
<p>Bitcoin was intended to be both a term for a new type of peer-to-peer monetary system and the system's core currency. Bitcoins, as they are known in the plural, BTC has become the leading cryptocurrency and the first monetary system based on blockchain technology.</p>
<div>In the same way that fiat currency, such as the US Dollar, can be divided into whole units like Dollars and cents that is one-hundredth of a dollar, Bitcoin can be divided into microbitcoins (mBTC), millibitcoins (μBTC), and satoshi.</div>
<p>If you know the US currency system then you must be familiar with nickels (5c), dimes (10c), and quarters (25c). Similarly, BTC can also be broken down for ease of use and practicality. It is generally called digital gold and has all the great qualities of a currency, for example: </p>
<p>BTC is portable</p>
<p>It cannot be confiscated unlike money because it is a decentralized token</p>
<p>It is widely accepted in restaurants, hotels, and other establishments</p>
<p>It can sometimes even be faster than the money in transactions when it comes to international transfers</p>
<p>BTC's price has risen at a parabolic rate since its inception in 2009. Although there have been dips, peaks, and valleys, zooming out reveals a clear uptrend. As a result, its price has risen from less than $0.01 to where it is now.</p>
<p>So, If you intend to keep your mBTC, μBTC, or satoshi for as long as you would keep a home, then BTC is a good investment option. Overall, countries are adopting Bitcoin as a means for people to transact and store value, and there has been an increase in adoption rates in recent times.</p>

<title>Mimetic Theory</title>

<preview>Mimetic theory explains human behavior and culture, and when understood contextually in economics, it deals with how things become desirable to individuals.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Mimetic Theory?</h2>
<p>Mimetic theory, developed by Rene Girard, explains human behavior and culture, and when understood contextually in economics, it deals with how things become desirable to individuals. Specifically, Girard states that mimetic desire operates as a subconscious imitation of someone else’s desire, in which we actively participate. For example, individuals are made to feel that Nike Air Jordans are worth the inconvenience queuing up for and the high costs because others feel the same way. </p>
<div>When contextualized to the world of decentralized finance, the theory explains the very rapid swings in the price of an asset, like Bitcoin. There are multiple groups with their mimetic desires that are in play around Bitcoin. For example, some mainstream investors are slowly becoming convinced of the viability and profitability of Bitcoin. There are also serious early adopters who are happy to advise each other to “HODL” the coin even during dips.</div>
<h2>Mimetic Theory Examples</h2>
<p>An example of this process could be seen in Elon Musk’s commentary on Bitcoin. Musk tweeted first that he was in favor of the currency and later backtracked, saying that he was breaking up with it due to environmental concerns. The prices went down as soon as he made the comment. Though Musk had no direct power to affect Bitcoin prices, he essentially functioned as a mimetic model for those who wanted to achieve an entrepreneurial, high-technology lifestyle through methods that he recommended. Musk later received backlash for his tweets and was accused of manipulating the market and “ruining lives”.</p>
<h2>Mimetic Theory Criticism</h2>
<p>The fundamental problem with Girard’s Mimetic theory is that it overstates its claim where it attempts to explain every aspect of human nature and assumes that there are no plausible alternative explanations for the phenomena he highlights. For example, it assumes that all people make autonomous decisions based on how others assign value to certain objects. When we look at the case of Nike Air Jordans, it is perhaps true that some individuals value it highly because those around them also assign great value to it. But what about those who do not value it as high because they are not interested in collecting branded sneakers? In that case, the mimetic theory fails to consider that individual autonomy might supersede a collective culture that places value on the object.  </p>

<h2>What Is Minecraft?</h2>
<p>Minecraft is a video game where players can essentially create and break apart different kinds of blocks in a three-dimensional world.</p>
<p>The game includes two main modes, one is known as survival and the other is known as creative.</p>
<p>Within the survival game mode, players have to find their own resources, build their own enclosure and cook their own food. They can also interact with mobs, such as animals or creatures that are attacking the players.</p>
<p>In the creative mode, however, you are this god-like creature that does not have to survive. You have access to each and every block in the game immediately, and do not have a hunger bar. In other words, you cannot die, and you do not have to feed or protect yourself in order to survive. This mode is intended for players who want to be creative and see what they can do with all of the resources available to them, while the survival game mode is intended for players who genuinely want a challenge and want to see for how long they can survive.</p>
<p>The thing about the survival mode which is unique is the fact that it has a hardcore mode. Within this hardcore mode, if you die, you lose all of your progress and have to start the game over again from the very beginning. You can easily mod the game as well, and this is one of the main reasons why it is relevant to this very day, as you can essentially build anything, and code any script to work with the game assuming you have the programming prowess to do so.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the Minecraft game.</p>
<p>The original is the Java edition, which, as the name implies, is built in the Java programming language.</p>
<p>The other one is known as the Bedrock edition, and this edition is programmed in C++ and allows for cross-play throughout various game consoles and PCs.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Miner Extractable Value (MEV)?</h2>
<p>Miner extractable value (MEV) is a measure of the profit a miner (or validator, sequencer, etc.) can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce. </p>
<div>One of the first forms of MEV that users suffered from was front running done by bots that merely replicated users transactions with a higher gas price so that miners would pick their more expensive transactions over others. Although front running has evolved, and it's no longer represented in that form, miners are now taking advantage of such attacks. Front running occurs when miners are making a profit by placing their specific transaction right before the users, making the later one fail while the miners transaction is successful and profitable. This occurs because the miners are able to reorganize transactions at their own will, using their position of privileged information to execute a trade first by taking advantage of the trading opportunities the users transactions signal. </div>
<p>Alongside front running, the most common MEV attacks also include back running, which refers to miners making a profit by taking advantage of how the execution of the users transactions will change the market conditions and placing their specific transaction right after the users. </p>
<p>A sandwich attack is the combination of the above two to specifically make a profit and take advantage of the users’ submitted transaction.</p>
<div>All of these forms of MEV can only be executed by miners, as they are the only ones who have the power to organize transactions within a block. This type of value extraction can occur because of the Ethereum mempool design, since the only motivation for miners to include transactions into a block is the amount of rewards they will obtain. </div>

<file>minimum-collateralization-ratio-mcr.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR) is the least amount of collateral that needs to be pledged against a given loan.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR)?</h2>
<p>The minimum collateralization ratio is the minimum percentage of investor funds that must be held in cash or cash equivalents at any time. This is a regulatory requirement to protect the integrity of the market. </p>
<p>The minimum collateralization ratio requirement varies according to the type of fund. </p>
<p>The minimum debt-to-collateral ratio is important because it establishes a benchmark for lenders when deciding whether or not to make a loan. Minimum debt-to-collateral ratios are typically set by lenders within the industry and often vary from one lender to another, although some states have specific laws requiring certain standards. For example, Fannie Mae sets a minimum debt-to-collateral ratio at 36% while Freddie Mac sets its minimum at 40%. The Federal Housing Finance Agency also requires that federally backed mortgages meet certain standards but its ratios differ slightly from those of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
<h2>Collateralization Ratio</h2>
<div>Collateralization ratio or collateral coverage ratio is one of the most important metrics used by lenders to determine how much money they should lend to a borrower. From it, they can calculate the loan-to-value ratio which is a measure of risk.</div>
<p>The collateralization ratio is a measure of the relative size of a loan in relation to the value of its security, i.e. collateral that backs the loan. The higher this proportion the less risky the transaction for the lender since he is protected from default by having possession of assets in case the borrower defaults.</p>
<p>The collateralization ratio is also known as Loan-to-Collateral Ratio (LCR) or Collateral Coverage Ratio (CCR).</p>
<p>Minimum Debt to Collateral Ratio = Good Borrowers</p>
<p>The debt to collateral ratio could be as high as 3:1 depending on your credit score and other factors. A good borrower should have a ratio of 2:1 or less. For example, if you have $10,000 in outstanding loans and only $5,000 in property value, then your minimum debt to collateral ratio would be 2:1.</p>
<div>There is no universal rule for what the minimum ratio should be. It varies depending on the type of business, the industry, and the asset being used as collateral. Of course, the lower the debt to asset ratio, the better. The best-case scenario is to have a debt to collateral ratio of 1:1.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?</h2>
<p>A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product that has enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the development cycle. In industries such as software and tech, an MVP can help the product team receive user feedback quickly in order to iterate as well as improve the product.</p>
<p>An MVP, due to the agile methodology, plays a central role in agile development. </p>
<p>A company might get the chance to choose to develop as well as release a minimum viable product due to the fact that it wants to release a product to the market as quickly as possible, test an idea with real users before committing a large budget to the product's full development, or learn what resonates with the company's target market and what does not.</p>
<p>An MVP can also help minimize the time as well as resources that a company might need to commit when it comes to building a product that will not succeed.</p>
<p>The primary benefit of an MVP is the fact that you will get an understanding of the interest of your customers in your product without even fully developing it. The sooner you figure out if a product can appeal to customers, the less effort as well as expense you will spend on a product that will not succeed within the market.</p>
<p>When it comes to the pitfalls, many teams might not fully understand its intended use or meanings. This could lead to the belief that an MVP is the smallest amount of functionality they can deliver, without any additional criteria of being sufficient to learn about the business viability of the product itself to name an example.</p>

<preview>An integral component of blockchain, a mining algorithm is the set of rules or instructions that a computer follows to generate a valid block.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Mining Algorithm?</h2>
<p>A variety of mining algorithms have been designed for use and each has its strengths and weaknesses. One of the most popular algorithms is SHA-256, created by NSA.</p>
<div>In the context of cryptocurrency mining, a mining algorithm is the set of rules that miners use to determine how to compile their new blocks. </div>
<h2>Popular Mining Algorithms</h2>
<div>SHA-256 is a 256-bit cryptographic hash function designed by the U.S National Security Agency. SHA stands for “secure hash algorithm”. A cryptographic hash function is a special type of mathematical algorithm that takes an input and outputs data in the form of a &quot;hash&quot; that is longer than the original input. </div>
<div>Equihash is a memory-oriented Proof of Work algorithm that was introduced in 2016 by Alex Biryukov and Dmitry Khovratovich. It was designed to be highly egalitarian, GPU, and ASIC-resistant.</div>
<div>The algorithm relies on random access to a large hash table (2GB per instance) which is built from scratch every time a nonce is found. Several other algorithms rely on this same approach, including Cuckoo Cycle, X11, and Cryptonight.</div>
<p>To make Equihash-based cryptocurrencies ASIC-resistant, the algorithm has been designed to require large amounts of memory and computational power which makes it well suited for the use of GPUs. </p>
<div>Ethereum uses Ethash, which is a Proof-of-Work hashing algorithm. It is similar to other algorithms, such as script or SHA-256, in that it requires a large amount of memory and high computational power to execute. The main idea behind Ethash was to create a mining algorithm that doesn't allow the use of ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) This was done because the developers of Ethereum wanted to ensure that no one would have more than 51% of the mining power, which could potentially be used to attack the network.</div>
<div>Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function (PBKDF) that adds a considerable amount of additional security to passwords. It was designed to provide key strengthening in the context of password-based authentication systems. It uses cryptographic hash functions, and it is an iterated hash, which means that it repeatedly applies the underlying hash function to the input value.</div>
<p>Scrypt is used in many cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin and Dogecoin, for proof-of-work mining and password-based authentication.</p>

<preview>Cloud mining or mining-as-a-service allows users to rent the mining capacity of hardware in companies.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Mining as a Service?</h2>
<div>Cloud mining offers a way to mine cryptocurrencies without having to deal with the physical hardware. If you want to mine Bitcoins, you'll have to buy powerful mining rigs, and mining pools aren't cheap. If you don't want to make the investment, but still want to participate in this exciting market, cloud mining is one of the solutions.</div>
<p>Cryptocurrency mining-as-a-service allows you to purchase computing power that is used to mine coins like Bitcoin and LiteCoin. You can then exchange these coins for fiat currency or another cryptocurrency. Some of the benefits of this feature include:</p>
<p>You don't have to worry about extensive upfront costs because it's a pay-as-you-go plan that charges you based on how much computing power is used.</p>
<p>You don't have to worry about downtime because the service provider maintains all the hardware and software needed for mining.</p>
<p>You can choose how long you'd like to mine and can switch it off at any time.</p>
<p>Some cloud mining companies even sell contracts for future delivery of the coins you've mined. This way you can lock in an exchange rate and guarantee your returns before having any risks involved with hardware or software failures.</p>
<p>Mining as a Service certainly has some downsides too.</p>
<p>Cloud mining companies, by nature of their operations, have to rely on outside sources to provide hardware and maintenance. The problem is that most cloud mining companies are not upfront about who they use as their service providers and other critical information. This makes it hard to know whether you can trust them or not.</p>
<div>Mining is not stable. The first problem with cloud mining is that the promised income is constantly fluctuating. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and their value can drop overnight without warning. Even if you've been promised a set daily income, there's no guarantee that you'll receive it in full or at all.</div>
<div>A cloud mining service may not have the best mining algorithm, or users may not be allowed to choose the algorithm of their choice. This means that you are forced to mine what the company chooses for you, regardless of your preferences. Even if you do mine coins that interest you, due to the difficulty rate involved, there is no guarantee that you will ever actually see those coins in your wallet. Many people who have lost money investing in cloud mining did so because they never received any payout at all.</div>
<p>Cloud mining services have been known to shut down without warning, abandoning all their customers without compensation or explanation. While many platforms claim to offer high-yield investment options, they might not be real at all. </p>
<p>A little research and cautiousness can go a long way in identifying a potential fraudulent MaaS company. </p>

<preview>The mining difficulty of a cryptocurrency is how difficult it is to find the right hash for the next block.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Mining Difficulty?</h2>
<p>The mining difficulty of a cryptocurrency is an indication of how difficult (as well as time-consuming) it actually is to find the right hash for each of the blocks. Mining difficulty can be defined as a measurement unit that is used in the process of Bitcoin mining (as an example). The difficulty indicates how difficult it is to solve the complex cryptographic puzzle in question. The difficulty of mining new blocks can either increase or decrease over time, and this is highly dependent on the number of miners within the network. The more miners there are, the more difficult the cryptocurrency is to mine. Increases in the difficulty, however, are usually a requirement due to the fact that they essentially keep the target block time stable. </p>
<p>Let's use Bitcoin as an example. When a cryptocurrency becomes popular, the number of computers that participate within the peer-to-peer network increases as a result. The miners compete against each other for limited block rewards, and with more participants, as well as a lot more computing power, the hashpower of the entire network increases.</p>
<p>Now, the average block time for Bitcoin is 10 minutes give or take, so in order to maintain this level, the difficulty has to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Mining difficulty is adjusted after 2,016 blocks, specifically for Bitcoin, or in other words, after that number of blocks has been mined. An adjustment of the difficulty up or down is dependent on the number of participants within the mining network as well as their combined hashpower.</p>
<p>The first miners used CPUs to mine Bitcoin, but eventually came to the conclusion that graphics cards (GPUs) are better suited for mining. In recent history, special ASICs have been developed specifically for the mining process. Bitcoin as well as other digital currencies are mined through mining pools, where a lot of miners join together and combine their hash rates in order to get block rewards.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A mining farm is when a group of miners mine together for a variety of advantageous reasons, like energy use.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Mining Farm?</h2>
<p>One of the most popular ways through which many people get cryptocurrencies is through the process of mining them. More specifically, we'll use Bitcoin as an example, as miners earn 6.25 Bitcoins each time they complete a block at the current point in time (May 2021).</p>
<p>Discussing a mining farm, this is typically a room or a warehouse that is dedicated to mining cryptocurrencies. Keep in mind that the farm can be a basement in a house with multiple ASIC machines, or even a large warehouse that features both GPUs alongside ASICs. Mining farms contain truly enormous power supplies, alongside huge fans to cool the equipment. They typically have more than a single person working on them. A mining farm is essentially a mining pool with miners that are housed within a single location and building.</p>
<p>Bitcoin mining is a simple concept: it is the process of someone verifying a transaction so that it can be added to the public ledger we all know as the blockchain. Transactions are added in blocks, and all you need to verify a Bitcoin transaction is a computer with a connection to the internet and a software program that is linked to the blockchain.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that computers consume a lot of energy, and air conditioning is typically required to prevent any overheating. This means that if you are in a geographical location known for its low temperature, you might just be in luck in this regard.</p>
<p>Mining is expensive, and in addition to using large amounts of electricity, the mining computers need to be replaced frequently.  As such, you will be required to have some capital upfront in order to start with your mining farm, and expand and maintain it through the currencies you end up generating.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Mining Pool?</h2>
<p>On certain blockchains — Bitcoin being one of them — there can be a lot of competition between miners who are determined to find the next block.</p>
<p>All of this means that it takes an ever-increasing amount of computing power (and electricity) in order for a miner to get their hands on crypto rewards.</p>
<p>In some cases, the infrastructure that’s needed to have a realistic chance of validating a block can be too expensive for an individual.</p>
<p>Mining pools are a way around this. As the name suggests, it involves pooling resources to increase the chances of success.</p>
<p>By bringing together their computing power into one collective group, the prospects of them finding the next block — and being rewarded with crypto — become higher.</p>
<p>If a pool manages to see off the competition and receive a block reward, it is subsequently divided between members.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind that this may not be an even split. In some cases, some members of a pool may receive a higher proportion of the reward if they have contributed greater levels of computing power.</p>
<p>Although all of this sounds nice and straightforward, it’s worth bearing in mind that there are a few downsides. Some websites have been established that claim to offer cloud-based mining pools, but have later been outed to be scams. Also, do remember that you may have to follow a list of specific rules within a pool or you may not be eligible for a block reward.</p>

<p>Back when the Bitcoin blockchain first launched, mining rewards were set at 50 BTC. This has subsequently halved every four years — in 2012, 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>Although this does mean that the mining reward has been reduced substantially since Bitcoin first launched, an increase in the cryptocurrency’s value does mean that the miner receives more in monetary terms.</p>
<p>As the supply of new Bitcoin that’s distributed through mining rewards continues to diminish, transaction fees are going to become an ever more important source of income for miners. Such fees do tend to be included in mining rewards.</p>
<p>Mining rewards play a starring role in creating an incentive for miners to secure the network.</p>
<p>Although most of Bitcoin’s supply is already in circulation, newly minted coins are still going to be around until 2140.</p>
<p>Because of how energy intensive Proof-of-Work consensus mechanisms are, some blockchains are beginning to make a concerted push away from mining — and are introducing new ways of rewarding those who secure the network.</p>
<p>One such example is Proof-of-Stake. This is where validators effectively put their money where their mouth is and lock up a set amount of cryptocurrency in a network. From here, their mining power is determined by the value of their investment — or they are chosen at random. In many cases, validators are solely rewarded in the form of transaction fees for their efforts.</p>

<preview>Mining rewards are the rewards that crypto miners receive for mining a new block on the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Mining Rewards?</h2>
<p>A mining reward, otherwise known as a block reward, is the amount of cryptocurrency you get for successfully mining a block of the currency in question. For example, you can be rewarded 6.25 Bitcoin when you successfully mine a block and add it to the blockchain. The amount of the reward actually halves every 210,000 blocks in terms of Bitcoin, and this is estimated to occur once every four years. The amount is expected to hit zero in the year 2140.</p>
<p>To further explain this point, we will be using the most popular and largest cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin. Each bitcoin block is 1 MB in size, and it is used to store the bitcoin transaction information.</p>
<p>For example, when Ted sends money to Anya, this transaction is stored on the block. </p>
<p>Miners that end up using devices in order to find the new blocks that will record this above transaction are rewarded for doing so through the block reward. This is the mining reward they end up getting. Other cryptocurrencies also have a similar mechanism for rewarding miners with blocks of the respective blockchain in question. The winning miner will typically claim a block reward by adding it as a first transaction on the block itself.</p>
<p>At its inception, each Bitcoin block was actually worth 50 BTC in mining rewards. The unit got halved after the first halving of 210,000 blocks, and so on until present day. In February of 2019, one block reward was worth 12.5 BTC, today it is worth 6.25 BTC, and this will change as more blocks are mined.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Mining Rig?</h2>
<p>The term “mining rig” can be a rather broad one to say the least. It could refer to a single computer that has been dedicated to mining cryptocurrencies — or refer to an expansive setup featuring a number of graphics cards that are tasked with discovering new blocks.</p>
<p>As awareness about cryptocurrencies has risen, so too has the competitiveness between miners to track down the next block — and receive a juicy reward in the process. All of this makes the process of mining harder and means more advanced rigs are required.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this means that the infrastructure included in a mining rig may need to be updated regularly to ensure it provides the computing power needed to be successful.</p>
<p>A mining rig consists of all of the usual elements you would find in a computer. The only difference is that crypto enthusiasts seek to personalize each of these components to give them the greatest chance of success.</p>
<p>You’ll need a CPU, a motherboard, a decent amount of storage and some RAM. However, as we alluded to earlier, the stars of the show are the graphics cards — as this is the part of the mining rig that’s responsible for doing all of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>Typically, mining rigs consist of more than one graphics card. This can make the process of building one a lot more expensive than you may have anticipated.</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve subsequently seen a heightened amount of competition for graphics cards between gamers and cryptocurrency miners. Some manufacturers have responded to this by making modifications to their GPUs that make them impractical for mining.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Minnow?</h2>
<p>In the English language, “minnow” can refer to a small fish — and a person or organization who is regarded as small or insignificant.</p>
<p>The same concepts apply in the world of cryptocurrencies. A minnow refers to someone who owns a relatively small amount of digital assets. This means that, when they buy or sell their crypto, it’s unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rest of the market.</p>
<p>This is at odds with whales — the term that refers to the very small number of individuals and institutions who hold substantial sums of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. If they decide to sell their holdings, there’s a very real risk that they could affect the spot prices that are seen on exchanges.</p>
<p>In rare cases, even a minnow can have a big impact. Some altcoins have incredibly low trading levels and a dire lack of liquidity, meaning that prices can shift dramatically even after a modest sale.</p>
<p>There’s no exact definition for how much of a crypto investment someone needs to hold in order to count as a minnow. However, research suggests that the vast amount of investors do fall into this category.</p>
<p>Even though the vast majority of addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain hold less than 0.1 BTC, they collectively own just 1% of the BTC that’s currently in circulation.</p>

<title>Minting</title>

<file>minting.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Minting is the process of generating new coins using the proof-of-stake mechanism and adding them to the circulation to be traded.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Minting?</h2>
<p>In cryptocurrency, minting is a decentralized method that enables a person to generate a new token without the involvement of a central authority, such as the government or the bank. It can either be a non-fungible token or a crypto coin.</p>
<h2>Types of Minting</h2>
<div>Cryptocurrency can be minted in two ways, the main difference between which is the procedure, while the final outcome, that is the creation of new coins, remains the same. One requires mining, which is called the proof-of-work method, and the other requires staking, which is called the proof-of-stake mechanism.</div>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Work?</h2>
<p>The proof-of-work method involves mining coins. Mining refers to the practice of generating cryptocurrency by storing and validating transactions on a blockchain, which is a digital public ledger. This is done by using high-powered processors to solve mathematical problems. In exchange, miners get paid in cryptocurrency for solving difficult cryptographic equations, adding new coins to circulation.</p>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Stake?</h2>
<div>Generally, more accepted as the better form of minting, the Proof-of-Stake method is done through staking. Staking refers to putting pre-existing cryptocurrency at stake, which means that users who wish to validate transactions in exchange for cryptocurrency must first wager a significant amount. This amount is referred to as their stake. Stakeholders are then randomly selected to verify transactions on a blockchain. The more coins an individual stakes, the more likely they are to be selected.</div>
<p>Stakeholders cannot spend the amount that they have put forth as their wager. If they breach the rules or are caught recording inaccurate data, they risk losing their entire wager. In this process, stakeholders are willing to bear the risks of staking huge amounts in return for the chance to make a profit.</p>
<h2>Mining vs Staking</h2>
<div>While both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake methods lead to new coins being minted, the term minting is often primarily used to refer to staking in order to distinguish between the PoW and PoS methods. Minting and mining are both methods of adding new blocks to a pre-existing blockchain.</div>
<h2>Minting a Non-Fungible Token</h2>
<div>The processes of mining and staking are used to mint cryptocurrency, but minting an NFT is a different procedure. NFTs are added to the Ethereum blockchain and are utilized by creators to sell their photos, videos, and digital 3D objects.</div>
<div>To mint an NFT, users need a cryptocurrency wallet with Ethereum in it. Then, they sign up using their cryptocurrency wallet on an NFT marketplace, such as OpenSea, and create their NFT by uploading their desired file and paying for the creation in terms of ETH. Once the transaction is verified, a new NFT is minted.</div>
<p>Minting can refer to different methods for creating different tokens. The most widespread use of the word minting means creating new cryptocurrency coins using the Proof-of-Stake method.</p>

<title>Mnemonic Phrase</title>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A list of words used in sequence to access or restore your crypto assets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Mnemonic Phrase?</h2>
<p>If you think back to your school days, you may remember being taught about mnemonics in English classes. Fast forward to the world of crypto, and they play a vital role in ensuring that your assets are kept safe at all times.</p>
<p>These phrases are usually 12 or 24 words long. Each word in the phrase tends to be unrelated to another. Wallet providers will usually provide you a mnemonic phrase when you open a new account — and it’s incumbent on you to write it down carefully and store it in a safe place… ideally in an environment that is not connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Mnemonic phrases come into their own in the event that your hardware wallet is lost, stolen or ends up getting damaged. That’s because it gives you a second chance to retrieve cryptocurrencies that would otherwise be lost.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a mnemonic phrase:</p>
<p>balloon marmalade rotate umbrella elephant bounce winner never ice helicopter crazy obscure</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, all of the words that star in this list are actually unrelated to one another. However, they need to be recited in the correct order for access to be granted.</p>
<p>The rationale behind mnemonic phrases is that it makes it far easier to humans to remember important information, in a way that’s more understandable than wallet addresses filled with random numbers and letters.</p>
<p>A more modern name for a mnemonic phrase is a seed phrase.</p>
<p>In non-crypto terms, an example of mnenomics could include MVEMJSUN, which helps children to remember the order of planets closest to the sun — Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. To help a child recite this in order, an example of a mnemonic could be: My Very Entertained Mama Just Served Us Nuggets.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Are Mnemonics?</h2>
<p>Mnemonics are simply songs, abbreviations and rhymes that assist in remembering something.</p>
<div>In the world of cryptocurrencies, mnemonics is a group of words, usually 12 or more that are generated when a new crypto wallet is created.</div>
<p>The whole point of this is to ensure crypto wallets can be accessed if the password is lost.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to retrieve the details of a cryptocurrency wallet given its decentralized and secure nature.</p>
<p>But mnemonic groups can be used to retrieve details.</p>
<p>There are two types of mnemonics used in cryptocurrencies. These include the mnemonic phrase and mnemonic passphrase.</p>
<p>A mnemonic phrase is also called seed key, mnemonic seed, and recovery seed, to name a few abbreviations.</p>
<p>Every time a new crypto wallet is generated, users are encouraged to take note of a mnemonic phrase — 12, 18 or 24 words long — on a piece of paper or to store it in any other safe place.</p>
<p>This ensures that users are not locked out of crypto wallets.</p>
<p>There are many obvious benefits of using a mnemonic phrase, including making the crypto wallet more secure and making it easier to store.</p>
<p>Mnemonic passphrases are an extra added layer of security, building up on mnemonic phrases, and act as a two-factor authentication for the crypto wallet.</p>
<p>They're also known as a mnemonic extension or a seed extension.</p>

<preview>A mobile wallet is a crypto wallet installed on a mobile device.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Mobile Wallet?</h2>
<div>A mobile wallet is a software program installed on a mobile device to store a user's payment data, including crypto and financial account APIs. In crypto, mobile wallets are typically mobile-based applications that store private keys. </div>
<p>Apart from storing, a mobile wallet enables its user to send and receive virtual currencies. These applications are available on leading app stores such as Play Store for Android and App Store for iOS devices.</p>
<div>Notably, mobile wallets do not store the virtual funds themselves but only the means of access, which are private keys in most cases. Crypto-based mobile wallets allow you to track and control your cryptocurrencies. For instance, if you have Bitcoin (BTC) in your wallet, your private keys will enable you to move your BTC to any address within the blockchain. The same goes for centralized mobile wallets that hold fiat money, except that your funds would be stored by your bank or custodian instead of a blockchain.</div>
<p>Most traditional mobile wallets use a username-password combination to grant access. Crypto-based mobile wallets present a seed phrase to facilitate password resets and wallet recovery. Popular crypto mobile wallets include Abra, Coinomi, Jaxx Liberty, Electrum, Exodus and Mycelium. </p>
<div>Mobile wallets are also known as hot wallets since unlike hardware wallets, they require an internet connection to work. As such, they are viewed as less secure when compared with cold wallets.</div>
<div>Critical things to look out for when choosing a mobile wallet include security (make sure it supports 2-factor authentication), supported assets, seed phrase storage options and ease of use. Additionally, user reviews can help in narrowing down your top options.</div>
<p>Advantages of a mobile wallet include speedy transaction processing time, user-friendliness, and easy accessibility.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Moloch DAO?</h2>
<div>Moloch DAO can refer to the DAO framework, a description of a DAO that uses the framework, or the name of the Ethereum grant-giving DAO that originally created the framework.</div>
<h2>Moloch DAO Framework</h2>
<div>In contrast to other early DAO frameworks, the Moloch DAO architecture is relatively simple, comprising a single smart contract per DAO, focusing on security, usability, and extensibility.  </div>
<p>Its primary features are:</p>
<p>Permissioned membership - new members are voted in by existing members</p>
<div>Weighted voting - members can have varying governance weights (in contrast to multisigs, where every member has a single vote)</div>
<p>Non-transferrable governance power - voting and economic rights are not liquid</p>
<p>Ragequit - members can exit some or all of their membership shares in return for a proportional amount of the assets in the DAO’s treasury </p>
<p>Moloch DAOs take actions in the form of proposals. Once submitted, a proposal must be sponsored by a member of the DAO. Once sponsored, the voting period begins, during which members vote on the proposal according to their shares. A proposal is passed if it receives more share votes in favor than in opposition; there is no quorum requirement.</p>
<p>If the proposal passes, it must go through a grace period before it can be executed. During this period, members who did not vote in favor of the proposal may Ragequit. This offers strong protection for minority members even without a quorum requirement.</p>
<p>Proposals can grant shares to new members (or additional shares to existing members), transfer assets from the DAO treasury to recipients. While proposals cannot interact directly with other smart contracts, Moloch DAOs can do so with the help of special helper smart contracts called Moloch Minions.</p>
<p>Stemming from these core features, Moloch DAOs have a number of important properties:</p>
<p>Strong minority member protection</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>Highly decentralized and distributed power</p>
<p>Support for efficient coordination</p>
<h2>Versions</h2>
<p>Since its initial launch, the Moloch DAO framework has upgraded to Moloch V2, which enables a new layer of DAO capabilities including the ability for Moloch DAOs to acquire and spend different tokens (instead of just one). Moloch V2 also introduces the “Guild Kick” proposal type allowing members to collectively remove another member from the DAO (their assets are refunded in full). It also added loot shares, which represent economic exit rights without voting rights.</p>
<p>Moloch V3, which is expected to introduce new flexibility and extensibility to the framework, is currently in development.</p>
<h2>The First Moloch DAO</h2>
<div>The first Moloch DAO, appropriately called MolochDAO, is a grant-awarding organization, focused on supporting Ethereum infrastructural improvements. It was originally summoned by Ameen Soleimani on February 14th, 2019 at ETHDenver. The MolochDAO whitepaper – co-authored by Arjun Bhuptani, James Young, Layne Haber, Rahul Sethuram – provides an ideological overview of the key V1 Moloch framework features.</div>
<h2>Other Moloch DAO Examples</h2>
<div>Since MolochDAO, many other DAOs have used the Moloch DAO framework. MetaCartel, Raid Guild, and Meta Gamma Delta are some of the prominent early adopters, and many more have since followed suit. Many of these DAOs can be found in the Explore section of the DAOhaus app.</div>
<p>Author: Collectively authored by DAOhaus</p>
<p>DAOhaus is the home for purpose-driven community DAOs and has grown from a 2019 hackathon project into a fully-fledged platform with +1,000 DAOs. DAOhaus enables users to add the capabilities of DAOs to their own projects without having to worry about the complexities of writing smart contracts or building dApps. You can launch a DAO via DAOhaus in a few clicks. </p>

<preview>The Monetary Authority of Singapore is the central bank managing money supply and regulating interest rates, inflation rate, and value for Singaporean currency.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Monetary Authority of Singapore?</h2>
<div>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is the central bank of Singapore and its role includes being the banker to the government and managing public debt, overseeing the monetary policy, dealing with exchange rates, and regulating banks and other financial institutions. The authority has two main purposes: promoting price stability and ensuring financial security. </div>
<div>Monetary Authority of Singapore uses monetary policy to control the inflation rates in Singapore by setting a target inflation rate or adjusting it to be higher or lower than what would normally occur without intervention. Since its inception in 1971, it has worked well to achieve these purposes.</div>
<div>Although its main responsibilities still fall into two major categories: managing foreign reserves while tracking actual inflation rates closely enough and ensuring market stability, the Monetary Authority of Singapore also strives to promote sustained economic growth. They do so by overseeing the monetary policy and regulating the banking and finance sectors, which gives them more power to make decisions. It has a board consisting of governors chaired by the finance minister, who makes all decisions while using every variable that needs consideration.</div>
<h2>Domains of Ministry of Finance and Monetary Authority of Singapore</h2>
<p>The Singaporean Ministry of Finance and Monetary Authority are two separate entities that control different aspects of its economy, but they both play important roles. The former handles fiscal policy while the latter deals with monetary policy.</p>
<p>Monetary policy deals with the macroeconomic level of an economy, GDP, and unemployment rate. Macroeconomic policies influence both short-term and long-term economic growth. The fiscal policy addresses government spending on different projects or tax collection efforts to create a taxation system that best suits its needs at any given time while also considering inflation rates when making financial decisions about what types of taxes should exist within your country’s current economic climate. </p>
<h2>Supporting Fintech and Blockchain-Based Startups</h2>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) performs unique roles in the sense that it not only regulates the financial sector but also deals with the fintech policy. It regulates both traditional banks and tech startups that provide financial services using new technologies, such as digital currencies or blockchain-based trading platforms for cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Singapore is heaven for blockchain-based fintech startups. Its policies are fuelling the cryptocurrency and blockchain revolution. MAS has led this new era in finance with regulations that promote innovation while protecting consumers from fraudsters. It recognizes and regulates fintech startups that use blockchain technology to improve lives across various sectors and achieve its goal of sustainable growth with innovative solutions like money remittance or mortgage service payments, among other things. </p>

<title>Monetary Policy</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/monetary-policy</url>
<file>monetary-policy.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Monetary policy can be defined as a set of rules that a country’s central bank makes to control the supply of money.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Monetary Policy?</h2>
<p>It might sound like that monetary policy is handled by economists only, but its effects are realized all around.</p>
<div>Monetary policy is a set of actions that centralized financial institutions of a country or regional organizations, like the European Union, use or follow to control the overall supply of money. These rules are followed to keep inflation and rising prices in the economy in check and allow for an environment that maximizes employment. </div>
<div>Monetary policy has both domestic and global impacts, which is the reason that powerful countries keep on revising them. The ultimate goal is to keep the economy running smoothly and the inflation rate within control. Central banks, according to the monetary policy, may increase the interest rate on borrowing to discourage spending.  </div>
<h2>What Are the Objectives of Monetary Policy? </h2>
<p>Monetary policy is used by financial authorities to increase the rate of employment, stabilize the prices of products, and set the long-term interest rates. Consequently, it encourages economic growth and stability by increasing consumer activities. Such policies also contribute to the increase in the level of exports and decrease imports in a country, which increases the valuation of the country’s currency. </p>
<h2>Key Tools to Implement Monetary Policy</h2>
<p>Central banks use a number of tools to implement monetary policy.</p>
<p>Central banks create new bank reserves to sell and buy short-term bonds in an open market. They buy assets to increase the money supply and decrease it by selling them. </p>
<p>Another tool central banks use is the interest rate. Nation’s banks deal with loans depending on the interest rate set by the central bank.</p>
<p>Public announcements about future policies also move the market, which makes it a powerful tool.</p>
<h2>How Often Does Monetary Policy Change?</h2>
<p>Changes in a monetary policy can be made when they seem inevitable. Typically, countries with stable economies make changes to their monetary policy after a set duration. </p>
<p>Every country has its own rules regarding the time to make changes to monetary policy. </p>
<h2>Impact of Cryptocurrency on Monetary Policy</h2>
<p>Central banks have a monopoly on issuing money as they’re allowed by the nation’s law to govern according to the monetary policy. </p>
<div>Cryptocurrency, by its nature, is not issued by a central bank. If the use of cryptocurrencies increases to a great extent, central banks can lose their monopoly. In fact, the first cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) came was developed as a response to the 2008 financial crisis caused by the policies of central banks.</div>
<p>It can’t be said with utmost certainty that cryptocurrency will soon dent the centralized banking system or affect monetary policy — only time will tell.</p>

<file>money.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Money is a widely used medium of exchange. It facilitates trade and gives people a way to store wealth.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Money?</h2>
<div>Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, issue their own currencies. This money can be either physical cash or electronic money.</div>
<p>There has always been some sort of medium that people in communities used to exchange goods and services. That medium is called money, and it has three main functions:</p>
<div>Store of Value: When you work for an hour, you expect to be paid in a currency (money) that will still have value when you go to spend it on food or rent. If the value of the currency changes too much or too quickly, people stop trusting it and look for other ways to exchange goods and services (like through bartering).</div>
<div>Medium of Exchange: Money makes trade efficient. Imagine trying to buy groceries without any kind of common unit of exchange. You'd have to find someone selling food who also happened to want whatever you had to offer … not very efficient!</div>
<div>Unit of Account: Money serves as a unit of measurement for valuing goods and services.</div>
<h2>Types of Money</h2>
<p>There are multiple types of money. Here's a look at the different types and their characteristics:</p>
<p>Cash is a type of currency that's issued by a government or central bank. The government uses it to buy goods and services from the public and pay for its operations. You can also use it to buy goods and services directly from other people if they agree to accept your cash in exchange for what they're selling.</p>
<p>Cash money can be in the form of coins, paper bills, and demand deposits that are held at financial institutions in different types of accounts. Demand deposits are also known as mobile money because they can be transferred easily with a phone call or an electronic transfer order.</p>
<p>Commodity money is any item that is widely accepted as a means of exchange. You may have heard the term &quot;bartering&quot; used to describe two people exchanging goods for items rather than using cash. Historically, gold and silver were used as commodity money (think of coins), but in modern times, cigarettes and alcohol have also been used.</p>
<p>Fiat money is any currency issued by a government and deemed legal tender. The key difference between fiat money and commodity money like gold or silver is that fiat money is not backed by any physical object — it has value only because a government maintains its value, or because two parties in exchange agree on its value.</p>
<p>Representative money is any form of currency that represents something else of value — in other words, there's an asset backing it up. For example, paper currency used to be redeemable for gold or silver — today, it's just paper with no intrinsic value other than what we've agreed is its worth. Many currencies today are representative money, in that they're backed by the assets held by the issuing country's central bank. </p>

<title>Money Flow Index (MFI)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/money-flow-index-mfi</url>
<file>money-flow-index-mfi.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical indicator that measures the buying or selling pressure of an asset through price and volume.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Money Flow Index (MFI)?</h2>
<div>Developed by Avrum Soudack and Gene Quong, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is an indicator that measures buying and selling momentum of a financial asset using both volume and price action. </div>
<div>A rise in usual price shows positive money flow, indicating purchasing pressure, while a fall in the price implies negative money flow, indicating selling pressure. A money flow ratio, also known as a money ratio, is computed by summing positive and negative money flows.</div>
<div>The money ratio is used to assess the MFI, which ranges from 0 to 100. It can be used to identify price extremes and reversals with a variety of signals as it uses both volume and price.</div>
<div></div>
<p>As shown in the MFI chart, a reading above 80 means that Bitcoin (BTC) is oversold and a price reversal to the downside can be expected. However, if you go back a little, when BTC was in the 40k range, the MFI indicator had a reading of 20 which meant that BTC is undersold both in terms of price and volume. After that, it has only gone up and is now in an oversold position on the daily chart. </p>
<h2>Why Is Money Flow Index (MFI) Used?</h2>
<div>The Money Flow Index is one of the most useful tools when it comes to analyzing a divergence in the chart of an asset. When the MFI oscillator moves in the opposite direction of price, it is called a divergence which implies an indication that the current price trend is reversing. Experienced traders avoid opening their trades when an asset is in the overbought territory due to the price reversal dangers.</div>
<div>MFI and the RSI are inextricably linked, however, they are not the same. The key distinction is that, unlike RSI, the MFI technical indicator takes volume into account. This is the reason why many market analysts prefer MFI over RSI, as the former offers indications and warns of potential reversals in a more timely manner than the RSI indicator.</div>
<h2>What Is the Best Setting for Money Flow Index (MFI)? </h2>
<p>Different traders rely on different settings, however, the most popular and recommended one is as follows:</p>
<div></div>
<h2>Money Flow Index (MFI) Formula</h2>
<p>Here’s how you can calculate the Money Flow Index (MFI):</p>
<div></div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>Money Flow Ratio = 14 Period Negative Money Flow / 14 Period Positive Money Flow</p>
<p>Raw Money Flow =Typical Price x Volume</p>
<p>Typical Price = 3 High + Low + Close</p>
<div>The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a reliable indicator, however, it can still offer misleading signals. This usually happens because of the lack of movement in the price action of an asset in the buying window suggested by the MFI indicator. Also, the MFI indicator may not offer consistent indications of price reversals, which is why it is important for a trader to use a variety of technical indicators such as relative strength index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), on-balance volume (OBV indicator), Aroon indicator, stochastic oscillator, and others before making a buying or selling decision.</div>

<preview>Money laundering is a technique used for illegal businesses to hide their money from the authorities.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Money Laundering?</h2>
<div>Typically, money laundering is used by those involved in scams and other criminal activities to conceal their cash flows and source of income. Money laundering schemes have been around since the 1930s, and began as a practice to cover up alcohol sales during the Prohibition era in the United States. The main purpose of money laundering is to hide money from banks and the authorities using shell companies, offshore banks and other fraudulent fronts. Those engaged in money laundering may often purchase valuables like art and luxury goods to avoid having to declare their money. </div>
<div>When it comes to cryptocurrencies, many politicians around the world have started to label cryptocurrencies as a form of money laundering. In 2021, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey banned crypto assets from being used as a source of payment, citing criminality and fraud. These anti-cryptocurrency AML laws have popped up around the world in other nations like North Macedonia, Bolivia, Algeria in an increased effort for governments to regulate and restrict cryptocurrencies.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Money Market?</h2>
<div>The money market is a term used to refer to all securities that are traded at wholesale or retail, and which have maturities of one year or less. These securities generally include short-term commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, certificates of deposit, and repurchase agreements.</div>
<div>The money market is an important part of the financial system because it provides liquidity in the event there is a sudden lack of available funds. A lack of liquidity can create a crisis situation where individuals find it difficult to obtain short-term financing. The money market, therefore, plays a crucial role in keeping the economy functioning smoothly.</div>
<h2>Types of Money Market Instruments</h2>
<div>A money market fund is an investment vehicle where individual investors pool their money together, typically through the purchase of shares in the fund. The assets of the fund are invested in high-quality, low-risk securities, such as government bonds and commercial paper. As a result, there are no guarantees regarding the rate of return on your investment.</div>
<p>The returns from money market funds are typically much lower than those from typical stock investments because they carry lower risks. But they are usually much higher — and safer — than bank or certificate of deposit accounts (CDs). In fact, money market funds don't have FDIC insurance like CDs do; they're covered by Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance instead.</p>
<p>Money market accounts are bank accounts that offer some of the conveniences of a checking account (ATM access, check writing) but with some added benefits not usually associated with traditional checking accounts.</p>
<p>A money market account is different from a savings account in two important ways:</p>
<p>There's usually a minimum deposit required to open the account.</p>
<p>The interest rate earned on the balance in the account is often higher than what's available for most savings accounts.</p>
<p>A money market account is similar to a checking account. Money market accounts often have restrictions on how frequently you can write checks or withdraw funds from ATMs.</p>
<p>These differences mean that money market accounts are an appealing option for people who want to save money but don't have enough to meet the minimum balance requirements of traditional interest-bearing accounts, such as certificates of deposit or savings accounts. </p>
<p>A certificate of deposit (CD) is a time deposit, meaning it is an investment that requires you to keep your money in the account for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>CD terms range from as little as three months to as long as 10 years. The longer the term, the higher the interest rate. However, there is typically a trade-off between interest rates and term length. A six-month CD with a lower deposit will usually have a higher interest rate than a three-year CD with a larger deposit, for example.</p>
<div>Some other types of money market instruments include T-bills, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and money market mutual funds.</div>

<title>Money Transfer License</title>

<file>money-transfer-license.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Money transmitter businesses need to acquire MTL or Money Transmitter License to be able to operate legally.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Money Transfer License (MTL)?</h2>
<div>Also known as a money transmitter license, MTL is issued to money transmitters to legally allow them to conduct business. Just like you need a driving license to drive a vehicle, a money transmitter license is required to work as a money transmitter. Its purpose is to help the government prevent money-related crimes, such as money laundering. When a money transmitter holds an MTL, it has to operate in the industry while complying with the law. Typically, it is issued by FinCEN (the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of Treasury).</div>
<h2>Role of Money Transmitters</h2>
<p>To understand who needs to acquire a money transfer license, it is important to know who a money transmitter is. A money transmitter or a money service business is someone who conducts their business in one or more of the following capacities:</p>
<p>Runs a currency exchange (both fiat and cryptocurrencies)</p>
<p>Check cashing</p>
<p>Issuing or selling traveler’s checks or money orders</p>
<p>Not all money service businesses need to go through licensing. Federal or state laws dictate whether a money transmitter/transfer license is required or not. A money service business likely needs a money transfer license if it is dealing with money (and receiving a benefit from the activity) within and outside of the United States on someone’s behalf.</p>
<h2>Obligation to Acquire a Money Transfer License </h2>
<div>Whether or not you need a money transfer license depends on whether you are considered an MSB at all. You must check with your state laws to confirm if your business model falls under the definition of a “money service business”. </div>
<p>Mostly, if someone receives money to transmit it to another location, it is considered an MSB and needs to go through licensing. Also, a business is considered an MSB if it transfers money through fax, wire, a payment gateway, etc. </p>
<h2>Do Digital Currency Transmitters Need an MTL?</h2>
<p>It all depends on the country from where you are operating your business. In the US, an MSB may need to hold an MTL if the company operates in the cryptocurrency space. </p>
<p>A few countries, where selling cryptocurrencies as a business is legal, exempt MSBs involved in the crypto space from acquiring a money transfer license, however, many do not. The same goes with the United States of America where only a few states offer this exemption. Therefore, you should check with your state laws to see if it exempts your business from licensing or not.</p>

<h2>What Is a Money Transmitter?</h2>
<p>Money transmitters in the U.S. are part of a larger group of entities called money service businesses or MSBs.</p>
<div>Regarding cryptocurrencies, any U.S. business that deals frequently with crypto will be familiar with the concept of a money transfer license or money transmitter.</div>
<p>This is because, under U.S. federal legislation, cryptocurrency is counted as a commodity meaning that crypto falls under the remit of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, also known as FinCEN.</p>
<p>Regulators perceive crypto-related businesses as money transmitters.</p>
<p>Crypto-related businesses also fall under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), meaning such businesses must obtain a license in every state they operate, although the northwestern state of Montana is excluded from these rules.</p>
<div>These regulatory requirements can apply to a spate of cryptocurrency companies, including payment processors, cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs and some cryptocurrency wallet providers to name a few.</div>
<p>In a guidance document published in 2013, named Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies, FinCEN clarified virtual currency and fiat money are subject to the same money transmission legislation.</p>
<p>According to FinCEN, a money transmitter is any individual who provides money transmission services or participates in the transfer of funds.</p>
<p>Hence, companies that accept cryptocurrencies from customers on behalf of a merchant or swapped virtual currencies for fiat money, fall into the definition of money transmitters.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Does Moon Mean?</h2>
<p>If ever you stumble into Crypto Twitter, “moon” is one of the most common terms you’ll encounter among bullish enthusiasts — usually accompanied by rocket emojis.</p>
<p>Since the very early days of Bitcoin, the moon has played a substantial role in conveying the sentiment that people have toward cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>If a digital asset is “going to the moon,” this means that the person saying it believes that we are currently seeing — or are about to see — dramatic increases in price.</p>
<p>Unusually, “moon” can also end up being used as a verb in this setting. As such, it’s plausible that someone might say that their favorite altcoin is “mooning.”</p>
<p>Just like other terms of crypto parlance, it can be difficult to know the exact provenance of where a word came from. (That said, we do know that the world “HODL” arose from a rather amusing typo in a Bitcoin forum all the way back in 2013.)</p>
<p>It’s very possible that “moon” started to become a common phrase around 2017, which is when Bitcoin broke $20,000 for the very first time — a huge milestone in the cryptocurrency’s long and storied history.</p>
<p>Another common word that’s used in a similar way is “Lambo.” Unsurprisingly, this relates to Lamborghinis — and the phrase “when Lambo” is used to ask others when they believe a crypto investment will have appreciated enough in value to buy a supercar.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Moore's Law states that computers' speed and capability will increase every year, even as cost goes down.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Moore's Law?</h2>
<p>When we discuss Moore's Law, we are discussing Moore's perception that the number of transistors in a microchip can double every two years, and the cost of computers is halved. Moore's Law states that the speed, as well as the capability of the computers, can increase every couple of years while allowing us as the end-users to pay less for them. In 1965, Gordon E. Moore, who was the co-founder of Intel, made this observation, which over time became Moore's Law. </p>
<p>However, when we take a look at the decades that followed the original observation, Moore's Law actually guided the semiconductor industry, and this was especially the case in the long-term planning and setting targets for research and development.</p>
<p>Moore's Law has been a driving force when it comes to technology as well as social change, alongside productivity and economic growth which are the hallmarks of the late 20th and the early 21st century.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this law implies that computers, as well as machines that run on computers, alongside computing power, will all become smaller, faster and cheaper throughout time, as the transistors on the integrated circuits become more efficient.</p>
<p>As transistors in integrated circuits become more efficient, however, the computers become smaller as well as faster. The chops, as well as transistors, are microscopic structures that contain carbon as well as silicon molecules, and these are aligned perfectly to move the electricity along the circuit faster. The faster this microchip ends up actually processing electrical signals, the more efficient the computer becomes as a result. Keep in mind that the cost of higher-powered computers is dropping on an annual basis, and this is due to the lower labor costs as well as the reduced semiconductor prices, both of which play a role.</p>

<title>Move-to-Earn</title>

<file>move-to-earn.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Move-to-earn is a concept that encourages users to stay physically active by incentivizing them with crypto-based rewards.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Move-to-Earn?</h2>
<div>While move-to-earn (M2E) is often touted to be a “novel” concept, several similar models exist in the centralized (Web 2.0) realm. There are already several applications connected to fitness trackers and other wearables, some of which have built-in gamification to help users monetize their fitness data. In this context, move-to-earn is Web 3.0’s first step toward encouraging users in the metaverse to lead a healthier lifestyle in the real world. Users of M2E apps can earn cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other digital assets just by maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</div>
<p>The blockchain space is continuously evolving, unlocking endless possibilities for service providers and consumers alike. Move-to-earn (M2E) is the latest addition to the extensive list of blockchain-powered initiatives like play-to-earn (P2E) and learn-to-earn (L2E).</p>
<div>Move-to-earn is a fast-moving, emerging sector within the Web 3.0 ecosystem. As an offshoot of the play-to-earn model, move-to-earn is a blockchain-native model that focuses on health and fitness while incentivizing users to engage in regular physical activities (walking, running, dancing, exercising, etc.). Accordingly, the more time you spend moving around, the more you can earn.</div>
<div>The majority of the move-to-earn projects offer apps with built-in gamification that works similarly to the play-to-earn model. As a user, you own the in-app assets that you earn as rewards, which you can exchange for cryptocurrencies or fiat money (depending on the app’s terms and conditions). Most M2E apps offer several exciting features, including microtransactions, staking, and in-app tournaments and competitions, allowing users to earn more rewards.</div>
<p>Polygon-based Dotmoovs and OliveX, Solana-based Genopet and StepN, and Binance Chain-based Wirtual are just a few of the notable projects accelerating the mainstream acceptance of the move-to-earn model.</p>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>As of now, there are only a handful of projects built around the move-to-earn model. These offer their own apps, which are usually compatible with various devices. Since the apps reward users for moving, they are designed to track and record users’ movements via GPS as well as through motion and health sensors - all of which can be easily accessed and controlled by the users from their phones.</p>
<p>Each game also features its own mechanics. For instance, StepN, a popular Web3 lifestyle app with SocialFi and GameFi elements, rewards users for moving around. Users need to buy (or rent) a pair of Solana-powered STEPN NFT Sneakers to get started. Once accomplished, the app begins tracking a user's movements and converting them into in-game tokens. </p>

<title>Moving Average (MA)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/moving-average-ma</url>
<file>moving-average-ma.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Moving Average (MA) is a technical indicator that reacts to the trends of the financial markets and is used by market experts to predict the direction of an asset's trend.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Moving Average (MA)?</h2>
<div>The Moving Average (MA) indicator helps traders in smoothing out price fluctuations and determining the actual trend. The basic idea behind the moving average is to take the average closing price for an X amount of periods of an asset. </div>
<div>Moving averages help traders with price analysis. It also helps them in determining their next potential move in the markets.</div>
<p>The graph of a Moving Average (MA) usually consists of two lines:</p>
<div></div>
<div>The gap between the yellow and purple lines indicates high amounts of volume. Whenever the yellow line crosses the purple line from above the price of the asset decreases. This is also known as a death cross. In the graph above you can see a major drop in volume as the yellow line creates a death cross with the purple line after dissecting it from above. On the other hand, when the yellow line crosses the purple line from below a golden cross is formed, as seen at the right-hand side of the graph. </div>
<div>Note: A significant gap between the yellow and purple lines signifies a large amount of volume. If the yellow line is above the purple line and the gap between them is significant then the price of an asset is experiencing a bullish run. The opposite is true in the case of a bearish trend where the purple line has crossed the yellow one from below and there is a huge gap that represents a volume difference between the two lines.</div>
<h2>Why Is Moving Average (MA) Used?</h2>
<div>The moving average is used by market analysts to determine the support and resistance of an asset by evaluating its movements in the market. The moving average paints a clear picture of the price action which can be used by investors to determine a potential bullish or bearish run.</div>
<h2>What Is the Best Setting for Moving Average (MA)? </h2>
<p>The ideal settings for Moving Average (MA) are the following: </p>
<h2>Types of Moving Averages</h2>
<div>In general, there are four types of moving averages. Simple or Arithmetic, Smoothed, Exponential, and Weighted. The most popular ones in the financial markets are two: Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA).</div>
<div>A Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated by taking a sum of all the data points in a given time period and then dividing it by the total number of time periods.</div>
<p>Here’s how you can calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA):</p>
<div></div>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>n = Total number of time periods</p>
<p>A = Average in a period ‘n’ </p>
<div>Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is usually preferred by traders more than the Simple Moving Average (SMA). The reason behind this is that EMA focuses more on the recent price data and also keeps the older price observation in place for the traders to analyze and make an accurate investment decision.</div>
<p>Here’s how you can calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA):</p>
<div></div>
<p>Where EMA = Exponential Moving Average</p>
<p>Smoothing = 2</p>
<div>You can increase the smoothing factor if you want the recent price observations to have a greater influence on the EMA technical indicator.</div>
<div>Moving Average (MA) is a great indicator that is used by a lot of traders, however, a combination of multiple technical indicators is preferred for determining the direction of the market accurately. Other commonly used technical indicators (TA’s) include relative strength index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), on-balance volume (OBV), Aroon indicator, and the stochastic oscillator. All of these indicators have their specific benefits as they allow a trader to view an asset’s chart from multiple angles and come up with a better investment decision.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)?</h2>
<p>Moving Average Convergence Divergence is a technical analysis method as part of a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two price moving averages.</p>
<p>The calculation is done by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA.</p>
<div>In terms of cryptocurrencies, MACD uses moving averages to determine the momentum of a cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>MACD was developed by Gerald Appel in the 1970s and is used by cryptocurrency traders to assess market momentum and identify potential entry and exit points, as well as price behaviors.</p>
<p>The MACD line specifically tells traders when the 26-day EMA and 12-day EMA are changing compared with their original positions.</p>
<p>A moving average, which is used to calculate MACD, shows the average value of past data over a specific time period.</p>
<p>There are mainly two types of moving averages: Simple moving averages and exponential moving averages.</p>
<p>The latter focuses more heavily on newer data, while the former assigns equal importance to all data.</p>
<p>To calculate the MACD Indicator, two exponential moving averages are subtracted from one another and the figures are plotted to generate the MACD line.</p>
<p>The MACD line is then used to calculate another exponential moving average which reflects the signal line.</p>
<p>On the otherhand, the MACD histogram shows the differences between both lines.</p>
<p>Both the lines and the histogram oscillate both below and above a line called the zeroline.</p>
<p>To summarize, there are three main parts associated with MACD.</p>
<p>These are the MACD line which indicates either an increasing or decreasing market trend, the signal line which is the exponential moving average of the MACD line, and the Histogram which shows the differences between both lines.</p>

<preview>A crypto exchange for buying and selling Bitcoin that closed in 2014 after a major hack.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Mt. Gox?</h2>
<p>Mt. Gox was a cryptocurrency exchange that first launched in July 2010. It quickly became the world’s biggest platform for buying and selling Bitcoin — and estimates suggest that, within three years, more than 70% of BTC transactions were handled through this platform.</p>
<p>However, February 2014 saw Mt. Gox’s fate take a very dramatic turn. The company revealed that more than 850,000 BTC had been stolen by hackers — and of this, 750,000 BTC belonged to customers. At that time, the crypto haul would have been worth approximately $450 million. Fast forward to day, and it would be valued at many billions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>About a month after the website closed, approximately 200,000 BTC was discovered in an old wallet. Efforts to try and track down the remaining lost crypto have been unsuccessful. Estimates suggest that there have been more than 127,000 credits seeking to claim compensation.</p>
<p>A court in Japan has been tasked with reimbursing victims — but it is highly likely that they will only receive a small fraction of the sums they lost.</p>
<p>The Mt. Gox incident was significant in the cryptocurrency space because it meant that a substantial amount of Bitcoin’s total supply had vanished forever. It also led to far greater scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges — and fueled the rise of decentralized alternatives where investors keep hold of their assets at all times.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Multi-coin Wallet?</h2>
<div>Crypto wallets are vital for users if they want to securely hold their assets off of exchanges. For crypto newbies, there are a few wallets that only hold one crypto asset or group of only a few crypto assets based on one blockchain network. For example, many wallets today only support coins/tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain; therefore, these can’t be considered true multi-coin wallets. For those keen to diversify their holdings that exist on multiple blockchain protocols, a multi-coin wallet (also known as a multi-chain wallet) is required.</div>
<div>A multi-coin wallet is, as the name suggests, a wallet that supports more than one crypto asset. One wallet to store a user’s coins makes it easier to trade them on decentralized exchanges and provides a streamlined way to keep track of their entire portfolio.</div>
<div>Additional benefits of a multi-coin wallet include the ability to hold hundreds or thousands of crypto assets at one location and earn passive rewards through staking or active user rewards, These also include the integrations that enable users to directly interact with various DeFi protocols.</div>
<div>AtomicDEX is an example of a multi-coin wallet, with the added benefit of having a built-in decentralized exchange that supports blockchain interoperability.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Multi-level marketing is a business model that involves selling products on behalf of a company by unsalaried and hierarchical sales teams and earning commissions based on sales.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Multi-level Marketing?</h2>
<p>Multi-level marketing is a controversial marketing strategy where companies recruit salespeople to act as &quot;distributors” or “consultants&quot; to sell products and services directly to consumers.</p>
<p>In traditional direct selling, a company sells goods directly to consumers through independent contractors called distributors. However, in multi-level marketing (MLM), the company pays these consultants not only to sell its products but also to recruit other people to become distributors.</p>
<p>Typically, in order to join an MLM scheme, you must pay a fee and purchase the products. The company offers the product at wholesale price, while the distributor is permitted to sell it at retail price. Distributors can also earn money by selling the products of other MLM businesses. To be successful in MLM, you must recruit new distributors under you and train them on how to sell the product and recruit other distributors themselves.</p>
<p>You don't have to be a product expert or celebrity to be a successful direct sales consultant. You just need to buy the products yourself, find people who want to buy them, and get them to buy from you!</p>
<p>The real benefits comeMulti-level marketing is a business model that involves selling products on behalf of a company by unsalaried and hierarchical sales teams – earning commissions based on their sales and recruiting efforts.  from recruiting others. The more people you recruit, the larger your hierarchy or downline becomes. Your downline grows when your recruits recruit others, advancing you up the organizational hierarchy.</p>
<p>MLM is legal in most countries, but it's a business structure that has been the subject of much controversy over the years.</p>
<p>You've probably seen ads with claims like &quot;Earn $500 a week from home!&quot; or &quot;Earn $1,000 a month in your spare time!&quot; It’s these types of advertisements and get-rich-quick schemes that make MLM a subject of controversy.</p>
<p>You may have dismissed these ads as scams, and for the most part, you'd be right. Many of these are multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, where you're paid not based on the work you do but on the work other people do. </p>
<p>But if you think all MLMs are scams, you are wrong. Some MLMs are perfectly legal, and a few have even grown into major corporations. </p>
<h2>Pyramid Schemes vs Multi-level Marketing Schemes</h2>
<p>Despite the seemingly similar structure, pyramid schemes and MLM are different. The ultimate difference between MLMs and pyramid schemes is intent and legality. MLMs are legal, whereas pyramid schemes are not.</p>
<p>Multilevel marketing (MLM) programs — also called network marketing or referral marketing — are structured so that participants earn money from both their own sales of products or services and the sales of others they recruit to join the program. Pyramid schemes, by contrast, require participants to invest money upfront for products or services with little chance of recouping their investment.</p>
<p>The key difference between MLM and pyramid schemes lies in how you make money:</p>
<p>In a pyramid scheme, you pay to join. You might be required to buy some product or service upfront — whether real or just &quot;membership&quot; — with no guarantee that you'll ever make your money back.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Multi-Party Computation?</h2>
<div>Multi-party computation (MPC) is a cryptographic mechanism that distributes computation operations across several parties where no singular entity can see the other parties’ data.</div>
<p>Data scientists often use MPCs to perform a joint analysis of data without ever sharing them.</p>
<div>MPC is a research area in the blockchain sphere with a specific implementation restricted to preserving the privacy of parties within a system, where all participants are capable to arrive at a mutually desired result without the need for any participants in transactions or operations to disclose personal or private data.</div>
<p>Despite having several use cases, an MPC mechanism is best utilized in scenarios where stakeholders within a company seek to calculate their average salary without ever divulging their private salary information to each other or a trusted third party during the computation process. The technology behind MPC leverages a well-established concept within the blockchain known as additive secret sharing, which is basically the division of a secret and its distribution among a group of independent, willing participants.</p>
<div>The same goes for public keys cryptography and encryption. Within DeFi, public keys can be divided into multiple pieces and be managed by multiple parties, thereby enhancing security. MPC technology allows for cryptographic keys to be divided, where no single key fragment holder can access the encrypted database without the presence of all other key holders. </div>
<div>Multiple holders can validate digital asset transactions by each creating a digital signature via private keys. In general, transactions only become valid when all parties of the MPC group are legitimate. After which, the MPC solution would distribute generated signature(s) among multiple members in the ecosystem, thereby, ensuring the safety of the transaction.</div>

<preview>Multi-party computation (MPC) as-a-service is a business model where consumers can rent MPC nodes from a service provider instead of buying them or building them from scratch.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Multi-Party Computation as-a-Service?</h2>
<div>By design, blockchain ensures transparency and decentralization. As such, all of the transactions are recorded in distributed ledgers that are available publicly. While transparency is the core feature of blockchain networks, it also leads to the problem of data privacy. Since transactional data is available in the public domain, malicious elements can readily identify similar patterns between transactions to identify and track individuals.</div>
<div>Add to this the explosive growth of DeFi. In the last couple of years, the DeFi ecosystem has flourished as hundreds of dApps and DeFi protocols emerged across several individual blockchain networks. While layer-2 solutions are aimed at solving the problems of interoperability and scalability, blockchain’s privacy-related concerns remained unaddressed.</div>
<div>To overcome this problem while ensuring that the core fundamentals of blockchain technology remain intact, next-generation projects started exploring the concept of multi-party computation to add more layers of privacy to the data that is being used in services on blockchain networks. Since multi-party computation (MPC) distributes computation operations across several parties where no singular entity can see the other parties’ data, it ensures end-to-end data privacy.</div>
<div>However, MPC is only one part of the puzzle. As a standalone solution, multi-party computation (MPC) can offer unmatched levels of privacy. But to make it worthwhile for the blockchain ecosystem, one needs to merge MPC with blockchain technology’s inherent features. The only way to ensure privacy while also facilitating dApps and DeFi protocols is to ensure that the transparency, consensus, and integrity provided by blockchain technologies are properly used to orchestrate MPC without compromising privacy. Currently, a handful of companies have been able to successfully merge MPC with blockchain technology, thus delivering the preferred attributes of both ecosystems to consumers and service providers alike.</div>
<p>That said, building an MPC solution from the ground-up needs time, effort, and resources. Accordingly, MPC-as-a-service has emerged as an innovative solution for enterprises (and individuals) who want end-to-end privacy for their blockchain services. Think of it as your traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) model where anyone can rent the services by paying a specific fee to the service provider.  The MPC-as-a-Service model offers businesses and individuals to scale their operations as and when needed by giving them to choose from several pay-as-you-use models.</p>

<preview>An added layer of security by requiring more than one key to authorize a transaction.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig)?</h2>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, security is a pressing concern. Making a mistake can mean substantial amounts of digital assets can be irretrievable forever. Some people have ended up losing hundreds of millions of dollars because they can’t remember the password to the hard drives where they have stored eye-watering amounts of crypto.</p>
<p>Businesses also need to be wary, and ensure that they can keep their customers’ funds safe. One way of doing this is through the use of multi-signature wallets, which is where more than one individual is needed to approve a transaction. This can prevent abuse of power and introduce safeguards.</p>
<p>An example of why multi-signature wallets can be so powerful comes in the form of Gerald Cotten, who was the CEO of the now-defunct Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX. He died in India — reportedly from complications linked to Crohn’s disease — but the company’s funds were irretrievable because he was the only one who had access to the firm’s cold wallet.</p>
<p>When utilized correctly, multi-signature wallets can add protection for consumers and businesses alike. They can be compared with a number of doors that need to be unlocked before you gain access to a room.</p>
<p>There can be a degree of flexibility when it comes to setting up multi-signature wallets, too. For example, if you have seven people who can authorize a transaction, the signatures of five of them may only be required for access to be granted.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that Karen, Jessica and Susie decide to establish a multi-signature wallet together. This would mean that two of them need to be present if a transaction is going to take place.</p>
<p>Multi-signature wallets can help to offer safeguards for crypto investors in the event that something happens to them. For example, a signature can be given to a lawyer, a partner and a friend — or kept in a safe place. The challenge here is ensuring that funds ultimately don’t end up being accessed by these other parties without their consent.</p>

<preview>Multisignature crypto wallets require more than a single signature to sign a transaction.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Multisignature?</h2>
<p>When you want to send funds from your wallet, a transaction needs to be created as well as signed. By signing this transaction, you are saying in a digital way that you are the owner of the funds in question, you have a key to manage them and you approve the transaction.</p>
<p>Now, to truly get a grasp of how multisignatures works, we'll need to discuss a single signature. A single signature cryptocurrency wallet will typically only need one signature to sign the transaction, and this is simple to grasp. Multisignature, on the other hand, is a kind of wallet that requires more than a single signature to sign a transaction.</p>
<p>A multisignature wallet is a wallet that is shared by two or more users, and these are called co-payers. Depending on the type of wallet, the number of signatures that are required in order to sign the transaction will typically be lower or equal to the number of copayers on the wallet.</p>
<p>In terms of the features found within a multisignature wallet, all of the copayers can see the funds as well as the transactions of the multisignature wallet. This type of wallet requires one or more copayers to sign a transaction in order to send funds from the wallet, and this feature adds a higher level of security to your funds as a result. A unique recovery phase is set for each of the copayers as well; however, if one of the recovery phrases is lost, there could potentially not be enough copayers to sign a transaction, and without enough copayers to sign the transaction, you will not be able to spend the wallet's funds. While this adds a higher level of security, it also adds a higher level of risk associated with it.</p>

<h2>What Is My Story (VeChain)?</h2>
<p>My Story is a cost-effective solution to combat the $50 billion counterfeit luxury goods industry. My Story™️ empowers consumers to ascertain the authenticity of their purchases by tapping NFC-enabled smartphones on an RFID tag or scanning a QR code on a hangtag. This will take them to a landing page that contains all information about the item, including its journey from production to point of sale.</p>
<div>Brands opting for My Story register verifiable facts about products, which are stored on the VeChain blockchain. Customers can confirm these facts simply by scanning the QR code. </div>
<p>The product data that’s registered include the quality, origin, authenticity, animal &amp; worker welfare, and environmental footprint.</p>
<div>DNV GL audit the data before adding it to the immutable blockchain. With the help of My Story, brands can present their behind-the-scene actions as a story to share with customers.  </div>
<p>My Story provides brands with a unique identifier for each physical item. Product information, such as photos, manufacturing date, and original retail store, is linked to each identifier and stored in an immutable and transparent manner on the VeChainThor Blockchain. My Story provides brands with an enhanced customer relationship management platform through which they can learn more about their customers' purchasing habits, such as items purchased and purchase frequency. Brands can use this data to gather valuable insight into consumer behavior and use this information to tailor marketing campaigns based on individual preferences.</p>
<p>VeChain is a blockchain-based supply chain management platform, and it is aiming to eradicate the issues of trust that so often arise in industrial supply chains. The platform is built on top of the blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies—but instead of being used for money transactions and purchases, VeChain is designed to be used for the tracking and management of products throughout their entire lifetime. It essentially acts as a digital ledger that tracks all the stages by which a product moves from where it's produced through all its different states until it reaches its final destination—and so only people with access to the correct tools can read this information at any one point in time. It's designed to prevent counterfeit products from entering the supply chain, allowing for items to be traced back to their original factories.</p>
<p>The use of blockchain technology isn't new or anything outside of normal business practice—but because blockchain can't be manipulated by anyone, it takes away the chance of human error on any level and opens up much greater possibilities for transparency in business practices. For instance, when grocery items need to be recalled, they're noted as such on this platform and only people with access to those records can find out about them. This reduces costs associated with lost sales and wasted food—and increases the efficiency of stores bringing in new products.</p>

<title>Negative Volume Index (NVI)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/negative-volume-index-nvi</url>
<file>negative-volume-index-nvi.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>The negative volume index (NVI) is a powerful technical indicator that shows how price is being influenced by low-volume time frames.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Negative Volume Index (NVI)?</h2>
<div>The Negative Volume Index (NVI) tracks the price movements and highlights the time frames in which the trading volume decreased from a specific point in time. One of the oldest indicators in the financial world, NVI was invented by Paul Dysart in the 1930s.</div>
<div>The premise behind the Negative Volume Index (NVI) is that a rising trend is one that continues even when trading volume declines. The idea is that uninformative traders are to blame for the excessive trading volume. Also, during the days with low trading volume, the informed traders (also called smart money) are at play. </div>
<h2>Why Is Negative Volume Index (NVI) Used?</h2>
<div>NVI is a great indicator to identify the mindset of smart money. Smart Money refers to the investment coming from big investors and is often associated with big price movements in the financial markets of any asset/stock/cryptocurrency.</div>
<div>Professional traders prefer to trade when the smart money isn't active which keeps the volatility level and the volume of the asset is low. This situation makes for a great opportunity to accumulate. </div>
<h2>What Is a Positive Volume Index (PVI)?</h2>
<div>The Positive Volume Index (PVI) can be used in tandem with the Negative Volume Index (NVI). While NVI measures the decrease in volume from specific points, PVI does the exact opposite. Generally, the increase of PVI is seen as a bearish signal and greater values of NVI are seen as a bullish one.</div>
<p>A 255-period moving average is used to determine trend reversals. It indicates a bull market when the NVI is above the 255-period moving average. Bearish sentiment is shown by the NVI falling below the 255-period moving average. In such a case, it sends out a sell signal; however, when it goes above the 255-period moving average, it suggests a buy signal.</p>
<div>Notice how the red NVI line remains flat when the price is changing and only increases when the price drops. The price drop is considered as a buying signal for the smart money investors and this is also known as ‘buying the dip’ in many situations.</div>
<h2>What Is the Best Setting for Negative Volume Index (NVI)?</h2>
<div>The value used in the NVI indicator is set to 255, however, you can change it depending upon the moving average you want to use while making a buying/selling decision.</div>
<h2>Negative Volume Index (NVI) Formula</h2>
<div>The NVI is calculated by comparing a single day's trading volume to the prior day's trading volume. Please note that NVI will only show a change if the volume has reduced from the previous day (time frame), which means that if today's volume is higher than yesterday, NVI shows no significant change. </div>
<div>If the value of the NVI is higher, it indicates that the volume is low and the price is increasing. Meanwhile, if the value of NVI is lower, it means that the price is falling as a low amount of investors are trading that asset at that given point in time.</div>
<p>The formula for calculating the Negative Volume Index (NVI) is as follows:</p>
<p>where:</p>
<div>The Negative Volume Index (NVI) is a powerful trading signal, however, it is recommended to use other technical indicators, like MACD, RSI, Aroon indicator, and Klinger oscillator, to make an informed buying and selling decision.</div>

<title>Network Latency</title>

<file>network-latency.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Network latency refers to the amount of time it takes for a computer on one network to communicate with a computer on another network.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Network Latency?</h2>
<p>Network latency is the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from one point to another. This can be expressed either as an absolute time or a relative time with respect to when the request was sent. This includes both the physical distance the data travels and how long it takes for it to be processed. For example, let's say you're streaming a movie on Netflix. The movie you're watching is actually stored on a server in California, but when you click &quot;play,&quot; your request goes through several other servers before reaching California. Once your request reaches the server that stores the movie, it has to be processed before it can be sent back to you. All of this takes time. A high latency results in more delay between the moment when you press the play button and the moment when the video is played.</p>
<p>The amount of latency that is acceptable depends on what you're doing online. Gaming and video chatting have higher latency thresholds than email and web browsing.</p>
<p>Information technology experts say that 50 milliseconds — that's one-tenth of a second — is about as much lag as the human brain can handle. While that's enough for most people, gamers may want lower latencies. Professional gamers consider anything over 100 milliseconds (1/10th of a second) too much lag for an optimal experience. </p>
<div>The lower the displayed latency, the better. High latency can be caused by a low bandwidth connection, overloaded servers, or full router queues.</div>
<p>Network latency is expressed in milliseconds (ms). For example, 200 ms means 200 milliseconds (or 0.2 seconds), while 300 ms means 0.3 seconds.</p>
<p>The factor of network latency is quite crucial when it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. This is because it directly affects the time taken for a transaction to be confirmed. </p>
<div>Blockchains are based on a consensus mechanism where miners rely on speed to earn rewards. Every second that a new block isn't found and added to the blockchain, potential revenue is lost.</div>
<h2>Correlation Between Latency and Throughput</h2>
<p>Latency is a measurement of time; it is the amount of time it takes for a transaction to be completed. Throughput is the amount of work, measured in the number of transactions per second.</p>
<p>Trying to increase the throughput of HTTP requests without considering latency will only cause performance issues. The goal should be to increase throughput while keeping latency low.</p>
<p>The best way to optimize is to decrease the number of HTTP requests or to decrease the response time from your servers. It is also a good idea to consolidate database calls where possible and try to cache as much data as possible.</p>

<preview>A Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine (NEVM) combines the best attributes of the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) networks.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine (NEVM)?</h2>
<div>Developed by Syscoin (SYS) in conjunction with Blockchain Foundry, the NEVM (Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine) is an evolutionary computation protocol that fuses the programmability of Ethereum and EVM, or the Ethereum Virtual Machine, compatible smart contracts with the security offered by the Bitcoin network.</div>
<div>The NEVM effectively brings smart contract functionality onto the Bitcoin network. This is accomplished by offering smart contracts with interoperability and scalability that can support global adoption while maintaining low gas costs and facilitating decentralized settlements secured by bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) security model. </div>
<div>This computational protocol combines the best of the Bitcoin network, their merge-mining hash rates, security model, UTXO efficiency, and compatibility, along with Ethereum’s broad range of smart contracts, all into a unified decentralized financial computation platform. With NEVM, users and developers can reap the dual benefits of each. First of all, the NEVM protocol eliminates the Bitcoin network’s long-standing “selfish mining” vulnerability. At the same time, it also introduces zero-knowledge proofs to ensure high levels of trustless interoperability and scalability, all on Turing-complete smart contracts.</div>
<h2>The Advantages of NEVM</h2>
<div>As a computational protocol, the NEVM enables smart contracts to scale up to 210,000 transactions per second (TPS) while ensuring that the accompanying gas costs remain as minimal as possible. With more upgrades due in the coming months, NEVM is projected to achieve four million TPS, the fastest throughput offered by any existing layer-1 or layer-2 solution.</div>
<p>With Syscoin’s product suite, NEVM solves a diverse range of problems that blockchain projects face in existing smart contract platforms. The protocol introduces many new features, including regulatory compliance for digital assets, hyper-secure transactions that can scale to support millions of users concurrently, and fully compliant toolkits for Web3, DeFi, Metaverse, and NFT projects - all without compromising core features like decentralization and security.</p>
<p>Other benefits include:</p>
<p>The ability to scale to an arbitrary number of transactions while eliminating the need for re-executing proofs of one-time executions</p>
<p>High levels of fault tolerance alongside interactive data</p>
<p>Trustless interoperability across individual chains</p>

<description>
<h2>Who Is Nick Szabo?</h2>
<div>Nick Szabo is a computer scientist and cryptographer who is known for the invention of Bit Gold, one of Bitcoin’s predecessors. Additionally, Szabo had invented the concept of smart contracts, which he initially described as “highly evolved” contract law and e-commerce protocol practices between multiple parties across the internet. Smart contracts later evolved to become a pillar technology for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in market cap.</div>
<div>Szabo is one of the personalities that some analysts believe to be the real identity of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. According to some papers, Szabo and Satoshi tried to reach out to a similar group of people in order to gather feedback and advice for their project, which some analysts consider as circumstantial proof that they are one and the same.</div>
<p>There are other arguments that state that Szabo and Satoshi have identical explanations as to why Bitcoin has to have value and that even their manner of writing is similar, according to a report from Gizmodo. Furthermore, research published by Aston University examined both of their publications too and found out that there is, indeed, parallelism in the mannerisms and phrasings that Satoshi and Szabo used in their papers. </p>
<p>However, the community still remains divided as to whether Szabo truly did create Bitcoin. Even Szabo himself has outright denied this claim, calling out a journalist in an email that stated: “Thanks for letting me know. I'm afraid you got it wrong doxing me as Satoshi, but I'm used to it.”</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a No-Coiner?</h2>
<div>A no-coiner is someone who believes cryptocurrencies have minimal value and/or are doomed to fail. Consequently, they don’t hold Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or any other digital currency. It needs to be noted that a lack of crypto coins in a person’s portfolio is not enough to label someone a no-coiner. Instead, the no-coiner tag stems from their attitude or philosophy about cryptocurrencies.</div>
<div>Some dictionaries, such as Urban Dictionary, place more weight on the attitude part than the lack of coins in their bags. For instance, it describes a no-coiner as a person who failed to invest in Bitcoin during the coin’s early days.</div>
<p>As a result, they express their bitterness to those who embraced the opportunity. Notably, they manifest their anger or frustrations through constant reminders that BTC and the cryptocurrency industry is no more than a scam or a bubble that is headed for ruins.</p>
<div>No-coiners suffer from what philosophers call ressentiment. As such, they redirect their failures and pains to external factors. Interestingly, those who don’t believe in cryptocurrencies exude the same fierceness as those who do.</div>
<p>In other words, they’re not just skeptical; they’re hysterically confident that the world has no place for digital currencies. Despite having evidence that cryptos have use cases, no-coiners only see their usage by criminals and other dubious activities.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Node?</h2>
<div>A node is the most basic unit and critical part of a blockchain infrastructure, storing its data and allowing all communication (transaction) to pass through it. It can be run by any personal computing device or server. Nodes are interconnected, and hence, can readily pass data amongst each other. It is essential for them to be always up-to-date in order to function properly. </div>
<div>There are different kinds of nodes, varying by the extent of data stored and processing capability. Moreover, they are required to verify the legitimacy of blocks by the included signatures in a chain, and have the capability to accept or reject them.</div>
<div>Common nodes are distinguishable from miner nodes since miners actually provide computing power to a network to solve mathematical problems and propose blocks. Miners also run full nodes in order to find valid transactions for accumulation into a block. The same isn’t true for common nodes, which only store, broadcast and verify network activity without proposing blocks. Running a node typically requires an internet connection, a computing device with varying requirements, and different levels of technical expertise.</div>
<div>Proof-of-work (POW) nodes can’t be penalized for being offline or inactive. In proof-of-stake (POS), a node can be penalized if it fails to maintain online status. If a node goes offline, it needs to synchronize with the rest of the blockchain first before proceeding any further when it’s back online. </div>
<div>The number of nodes is a great measure of security and decentralization, as the network becomes more resilient with the rise in their numbers. This is because a large number of nodes ensure that in the event of network attacks and some of them going offline, a reasonable number would remain to ensure continuity of the network and its functions.</div>

<preview>Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that can be used for both servers and desktop apps.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Node.js?</h2>
<p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source runtime environment and framework for executing web applications outside of the client's browser.</p>
<div>It's a server-side programming language that's mostly used for event-driven servers like standard websites and back-end API services, although the intention while creating it was to develop a real-time, push-based architecture in mind. Every browser has its own JS engine, and node.js is one of them. The V8 JavaScript engine in Google Chrome is used to power Node.js. Isn't it a little complicated?</div>
<p>In basic terms, this means that whole sites may be run on a single “stack,” allowing you to focus on accomplishing the project's business goals rather than on development and maintenance.</p>
<p>Because Node.js is open source, it is free to use and is continually being updated and enhanced by a worldwide developer community.</p>
<p>A crucial point to grasp about Node.js is that it is truly neither a framework nor a library, as with traditional application software, but a runtime environment.</p>
<p>A runtime environment (also known as an RTE) is a collection of Web APIs that a developer may use to create code, as well as a JavaScript engine that parses that code. This makes it light, versatile, and simple to deploy, all of which will aid in the optimization and speeding up of your application project.</p>
<h2>The Basic Node.js Architecture</h2>
<p>The architecture of Node.js makes it quite popular among programmers. Unlike most other runtime environments, which use multi-threaded processing models, Node.js accomplishes everything in a single thread.</p>
<p>In multi-threaded processing configurations, each server has a restricted thread pool it may access. As a result, whenever a server receives a request, it selects a thread from the pool and assigns it to that request to handle the processing. The processing is synchronous and sequential in this scenario, which implies that just one operation is carried out at a time.</p>
<p>When using multiple-thread processing, a thread is chosen for each request until all of the threads are used up. When this happens, the server must wait for a thread that is now too busy to become available again. This might result in sluggish and inefficient apps, which can have negative consequences ranging from customer experience to lead conversions. It is especially problematic if your program has to handle a large number of concurrent client requests.</p>
<p>Node.js, on the other hand, works on a single thread. The distinction between the two is that you might expect single-thread architectures to use event loops to conduct blocking Input/Output activities in a non-blocking manner. Don't be concerned if any of these phrases are foreign to you. </p>
<p>In principle, a single-thread design can operate and grow faster and more effectively than multiple-thread configurations. This is exactly what Ryan Dahl had in mind when he created Node.js, and it's one of the reasons it is so popular among web app developers.</p>
<h2>Examples of Application Developed Using Node.js</h2>
<p>Here are some more in-depth case studies to help you understand the technology's real-world applications and commercial applications.</p>
<p>Netflix is the most popular streaming media and video-on-demand service in the world. It's a data-driven platform that employs extensive A/B testing to provide a rich experience to its 195+ million global subscribers.</p>
<p>The difficulty of conditional dependencies and app scalability is compounded by the large number of unique packages released each push cycle. As a result, the firm chose Node.js, which is lightweight and speedy. One of the most significant outcomes was a 70% decrease in loading time.</p>
<p>When moving their mobile app backend from Ruby on Rails to Node.js, LinkedIn, the world's largest business and employment-oriented social networking site, trusted Node.js as well.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it was still a fairly immature runtime environment at the time, it proved to be a wise decision. The new app was 2-10 times quicker than the previous one, and it was also quite light. Furthermore, the development time was short.</p>
<p>Yes, it is correct. Node.js is also used by NASA.</p>
<p>The technology is far more important in this application than in others since it saves lives by keeping astronauts safe during their perilous space missions.</p>
<p>Following a near-fatal accident caused by inefficient data stored in several locations, NASA was confronted with the task of consolidating data relating to EVA spacesuits into a single cloud database to minimize access times. The new Node.js-based system reduced the number of steps in the process from 28 to 7.</p>
<p>Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, and it is making its way into the internet shopping business. Despite the risks involved, the company has hopped on the bandwagon of working with Node.js, a relatively new and extremely hot technology.</p>
<p>On the client side, the business re-engineered the mobile app to include complex functionality. Walmart praised Node.js for its asynchronous I/O and single-threaded event loop architectures, which allowed it to manage several concurrent queries.</p>

<title>Nominators</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/nominators</url>
<file>nominators.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Nominators are one of two main actors who are involved in a blockchain network that uses the nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus algorithm.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Nominators?</h2>
<div>Nominators are one of two main actors who are involved in a blockchain network that uses the nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus algorithm, the other being validators.</div>
<p>In regular proof-of-stake (PoS) networks, the power of an entity that is mining or validating network transactions is wholly reliant on the number of network tokens they hold. The more tokens of that network held by the miner or validator, the more mining power they have. This same power is also used in other types of decision-making scenarios and is popularly used in governance functions, with validators voting on proposals for future development of the network, for example.</p>
<p>However, in most environments, as some implementations of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have demonstrated, not all validators or miners will use their voting power in every decision-making event. This can be because they are not available to vote actively on every single event. It can also  simply be because they may choose not to vote because they are unable or unwilling to commit the time or resources to understand the often complex technical considerations required for some decisions.</p>
<div>One solution for this is PoS variation called NPoS, which involves the process of selecting (or nominating) validators that are allowed to participate in the consensus protocol. NPoS is most well-known to be used by Substrate-based blockchains like Polkadot and Kusama.</div>
<p>As mentioned earlier, validators and nominators both play crucial roles in NPoS.</p>
<div>Validators form and secure the network, maintaining the services provided by it through the production of new blocks and validating parachain blocks. They run perpetually, using the network’s native tokens to back them as validators and to incentivize their continued abidance by the protocol’s rules. Failing to abide by the rules penalizes them (commonly referred to as “slashing,” while keeping the rules rewards them with a share of the fees generated by use of the network’s services.</div>
<p>In NPoS, however, validators must be elected to participate in every active set, which is a determined period of time that typically becomes longer at latter block heights. This is where nominators come in</p>
<p>Nominators are also token owners but, for reasons mentioned above, are not actively participating in consensus. Instead they use their economic backing (in the form of tokens owned) to nominate the validators of their choosing to be designated for active slots. Nominators are incentivized to do this by earning a share of the rewards that their nominated validators in active slots earn. Like validators, they must also play by the protocol rules or face penalties.</p>
<p>Validators are assigned active slots proportionally to their nominations. Thus, validators who receive more nominations and a higher value of tokens backing them are more likely to be elected into the next active set of validators.</p>
<p>Because rewards are eventually distributed proportionally to the validaotr’s overall stake, nominators stand to earn higher rewards for nominating perhaps less-established validators who may have smaller stakes backing them. This incentivizes nominators to seek out a more diverse group of validators instead of nominating the same ones for each set.</p>
<p>On the other hand, misbehaving validators will get penalized, reducing rewards for nominators. This incentivizes nominators to conduct due diligence on validators to seek out good-behaving ones.</p>
<p>In this way, NPoS can improve decentralization of blockchain networks by maximizing the decision-making power, while maintaining fairness through proportional and justified representation.</p>

<title>Non-Custodial</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-custodial</url>
<file>non-custodial.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Usually referring to the storage of keys, in relation to wallets or exchanges, a non-custodial setup is one in which private keys are held by the user directly.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Non-Custodial?</h2>
<div>Non-custodial refers to a service in which the funds or assets aren’t custodied or possessed by a platform or third-party, at any point during a transaction or service period. Instead, the whole process (usually economic in nature) occurs through trustless smart contracts — the complex self-executing series of code that power blockchain networks. This is in contrast to custodial services, which take possession of a user’s funds or assets for safekeeping, management, etc. Non-custodial services are considered the hall-mark and prime example of decentralization and non-reliance to intermediaries. Crypto proponents prefer them over custodial services since the latter incurs more risks.</div>
<div>The risks involved with custodial services include but aren’t limited to censorship, confiscation, downtime, insolvency, added waiting period for processing, complexity and counterparty risk. Typical examples of centralized services are exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, lending/borrowing services like BlockFi, stablecoins like Tether and Binance USD, digital asset management services like Grayscale and Paypal, etc. </div>
<p>On the other hand, non-custodial services are trustless, censorship resistant, generally fast, less complex, can’t be confiscated and carry no risk of insolvency and downtime. </p>
<div>Examples of non-custodial services include decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like EtherDelta, Binance Dex, 1inch and Uniswap, lending/borrowing services like Maker and Compound, stablecoins like DAI and Ampleforth, and digital asset management services like yearn.finance and Genesis Vision. Non-custodial wallet solutions like TrustWallet and hardware wallets like Ledger Nano, Trezor and CoolWallet allow users full ownership and control over their crypto assets through their private keys or recovery seeds.</div>
<p>Custodial services currently have an advantage in terms of recovery and security, allowing reputable centralized services to help users better in the event of theft or malicious activity since most of them are insured. Non-custodial services carry a smart contract risk, in which buggy or error-prone code can be exploited for fund theft. Furthermore, if users lose private keys or access to accounts, they often have almost no way to retrieve their funds. As they control access to their users’ funds, custodial services have much better recovery options available via identification methods.</p>
<div>Increasing anti-money laundering (AML) regulations such as the FATF Travel Rule targeting custodial crypto service providers are also driving users to non-custodial solutions, which allow them to retain their anonymity, for the time being at least.</div>

<title>Non-fungible Assets</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/non-fungible-assets</url>
<file>non-fungible-assets.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The term &quot;non-fungible assets&quot; describes non-fungibility within a collection of similar assets being issued by a single party.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Non-fungible Assets?</h2>
<div>Fungibility, essentially whether something is unique or not, is an important part of a digital asset’s identity, and can define what roles they are able to take on. In the crypto space, this term is most commonly used in reference to NFTs. Here, the phrase “non-fungible” refers to a single indivisible object – the NFT. Unlike in other cases where the word “token” refers to the actual digital asset or contract, the &quot;token&quot; in NFT refers to the one and only indivisible digital item. </div>
<p>Non-fungible assets (NFAs) are different from NFTs in several important ways. The term describes non-fungibility within a collection of similar assets being issued by a single party. They differ from NFTs in two very important ways.</p>
<p>1. Only a single entity besides the issuer is allowed to hold units of this asset. </p>
<p>2. The identity of the entity that is associated with the asset cannot be changed. The asset and the identity of the entity for which it has been issued form an unbreakable bond.</p>
<div>So NFAs differ from NFTs in who can hold them (one authorized entity), and the fact that they can represent more than one “item.” For specific businesses, this is a game-changer. Storage certificates, for example, can now be issued securely to clients without the risk of manipulation. They can also work in the role of an accounting token. NFAs also have use cases like making correspondence banking possible on a blockchain, as the technology ensures a 100% safe and compliant conversion of values from each customer account (which is implemented as its own distinguished digital asset, which only the customer can hold) to the destination account.</div>

<file>non-fungible-token.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptocurrencies that do not possess the property of fungibility.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?</h2>
<div>Traditionally, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are fungible, meaning that every one unit of BTC is exactly the same as another unit of BTC and they can be exchanged for one another with no further considerations. Fungibility is one of the fundamental properties of traditional currencies too, like the USD. But in some use cases, tokens might be non-fungible, most commonly when they are used as digital proof-of-ownership of underlying assets.</div>
<p>For example, NFTs can be used to represent digital art: at one point, an extremely popular Ethereum-based blockchain game CryptoKitties associated its tokens with unique images of cartoon cats and allowed users to trade those cats by exchanging the corresponding tokens.</p>
<p>Another prominent example is the tokenization of real-world assets like equity or commodities to make them tradable digitally — in this case, tokens represent unique assets and are thus non-fungible.</p>
<p>More rarely, a token may become non-fungible by losing its fungibility property as a result of known past activity. For example, if a certain amount of Bitcoin — fungible by default — is used to pay for illegal goods or fund illegal activities and the overall network becomes aware of it, that Bitcoin becomes less- or non-fungible, as it is unlikely to be accepted by exchanges and other service providers.</p>

<file>nonce.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>When a transaction is hashed by a miner, an arbitrary number meant to be used only once is generated, called a nonce.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Nonce?</h2>
<div>Nonce (literal meaning — for one occasion) is a way to sequence and segregate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and other smart contract platforms. Generally, it is used in cryptography as a non-repeated number for securing communication. </div>
<div>An Ethereum wallet can broadcast multiple transactions from an account, without much delay between one another, to the mainnet. Hence, it is necessary to have a mechanism which can determine which transaction is processed first. Otherwise, there would be malfunctions caused by conflicting transactions associated with account balance transfers.</div>
<p>For example, if a broadcasted transaction has a nonce value of 2, it must be processed first before the transaction with nonce value of 3. The Ethereum mainnet is designed in such a manner that a higher-nonce-value transaction couldn’t be included in any blocks until the ones before them are cleared and settled on-chain. </p>
<p>However, this process can have issues since if a transaction with a lower nonce value is stuck (owing to the gas amount), all transactions received afterwards with nonce values higher would also be stuck.</p>
<div>The process of transaction cancellation and transaction speeding on the Ethereum network also uses “nonce” as its basis. For instance, if a user wishes to cancel a transaction, he can send a transaction to his own wallet with the same nonce number as the transaction he is attempting to cancel. It’s not always guaranteed, though, since if the nonce is the same, any transaction might get randomly approved. </div>
<div>In case a transaction is stuck and does not get approved, users can raise the gas price and send the same transaction with the same nonce number. Since the nonce number is the same while the fee has been bumped, this transaction has a higher probability of being validated. Some wallets have both of these functions automated.</div>

<title>Notarization on Blockchain</title>

<file>notarization-on-blockchain.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Notarization on blockchain simply uses the intrinsic nature and advantages of blockchain technology to let anyone create a timestamped artifact.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Notarization on Blockchain?</h2>
<div>Practically speaking, a blockchain is nothing more than a global database that has no central authority for upkeep and operation; it is decentralized. Because of this, blockchain technology excels at securely recording tamper-proof records, which are anchored in time. </div>
<div>A blockchain usually grows block by block and utilizes strong cryptographic mechanisms to prevent any modification of past blocks. In other words, it’s practically impossible to alter information that’s already been recorded. This means that if you can locate the block where a certain dataset has been recorded, then you can always, and without any doubt, prove when and (just as important) by whom this data was recorded. This is especially advantageous when using a public blockchain because everyone can look up this record, and no third party is needed to confirm its veracity. It is the ultimate technological transparency because the blockchain itself acts as the third party. </div>
<div>There are many use cases where it is important to be able to prove something in time. Copyright, for example, requires this to prove who created,  talked about, or thought of something first. This could be a song, a text, a video, a new invention, or anything that could potentially be of value and worth copyrighting. Another case is supply chain transparency, being able to track shipments and check the process of loading and unloading ships or trucks, and creating an electronic bill of lading. </div>
<div>Along with timestamping, another area where blockchain provides a naturally superior solution is proving authorship of the timestamped record. A blockchain only stores public data. It only uses private data if someone puts it there on purpose. There is a cryptographically secure way to let the author prove that they are the author at any point in time without having to reveal any secure information. In all known cases of Notarization, either in real life or on a blockchain, it is important to know the author or beneficiary. Blockchain solves this problem simply by leveraging the nature of the technology.</div>
<p>Finally, after proving the &quot;when&quot; and &quot;who,&quot; we need to prove the &quot;what.&quot; This refers to the thing being verified, e.g. a song or a contract, etc. While blockchain is not good at storing large quantities of data, this is not even necessary. The whole file does not need to be stored on the blockchain; rather by mathematical means, it is possible to create a unique fingerprint for this data which is virtually impossible to fake. This fingerprint is very small, can be put on blockchain at a reasonable cost, and simply anchors the “who,” “what,” and “when” in a place that can be easily verified. </p>
<p>At its core, Notarization on blockchain simply uses the intrinsic nature and advantages of blockchain technology to let anyone create a timestamped artifact. The authorship and identity of this artifact can easily and securely be identified at any point. Whether this task is performed by a real Notary or the actual beneficiary does not matter, the data is still anchored in time and to an author. </p>

<title>Odysee</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/odysee</url>
<file>odysee.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Odysee is a server-less video hosting and distribution platform built on top of the LBRY protocol.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Odysee?</h2>
<div>It is a website that enables the uploading and sharing of videos, allowing its users to publish their work without the need for paying hosting fees. It is also decentralized and censorship-resistant, meaning that there are no servers to shut down or block.</div>
<p>Through the Odysee app, you can create your own channel, upload your videos to be shared with the world, and subscribe to other channels you enjoy. As a viewer, you can explore content from around the world through channels and hashtags.</p>
<p>Odysee offers a safe home for your videos. But what does that mean in practice? Here are the three pillars of the Odysee platform:</p>
<p>Decentralization means that your videos are hosted all over the world. There is no single point of failure, and no one can take your videos offline. In this way, Odysee is similar to blockchain-based services like LBRY and Bitcoin (where transactions are stored in blocks across a network of computers).</p>
<p>A permanent home for videos is important because many video hosting platforms today have taken down videos for dubious reasons. Odysee ensures that your content will always be available because it would require an enormous amount of computing power to remove the files from numerous computers around the world.</p>
<p>The ability to earn money with your videos is one of the most exciting features of Odysee. By using LBRY credits, you can reward people who view your content directly by tipping them or offering subscriptions. You can also earn tips on other people's content by &quot;liking&quot; or commenting.</p>
<h2>Relation Between Odysee and LBRY Network</h2>
<p>Odysee is created by the team behind LBRY Network or LBRY Blockchain. Earlier, it used to be lbry.tv.</p>
<p>LBRY TV is a media platform that allows creators to set their own price, keep their own ad revenue, and now — host their content. Creators can either choose to host their content on the platform or simply link out to their own website. The platform has the potential to be a major player in creating an independent creator economy without the need for advertisers (or middleman platforms) to generate revenue.</p>
<p>The company believes that its new hosting service will not only help creators generate more income but also protect them from censorship as it’s harder for platforms such as YouTube to ban creators when they’re not hosting the content on their platform.</p>
<p>It sees itself as a community-driven, decentralized Netflix and plans on being home to some of the most popular movies, shows, and documentaries on the internet.</p>
<p>LBRY Network is a blockchain-based, open-source protocol for the creation, distribution, and discovery of digital content. With LBRY, you can buy, rent, or sample videos from major studios, indies, and even YouTube creators!</p>

<title>Off-Chain</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/off-chain</url>
<file>off-chain.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A transaction that is processed outside the blockchain network with an increased speed and reduced cost.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Off-Chain?</h2>
<p>There are two different transactions that occur on the blockchain:</p>
<div>On-chain transactions are those reflected on the distributed ledger and are visible to all the network users. On the other hand, off-chain transactions occur outside the blockchain network. Such a transaction doesn’t need the services of miners because no ledger verification is conducted.</div>
<p>Unlike on-chain transactions, off-chain transactions can be made instantly. This method entails lower fees, happens instantly, and offers more anonymity. </p>
<h2>The Difference Between Off-Chain and On-Chain Transactions</h2>
<p>On-chain transactions are reflected on the distributed ledger by the blockchain network. It includes the verification of the ledger by miners to validate the transaction. Since it’s all happening on-chain, transaction details are recorded. The transaction is added to the distributed ledger and made visible on the entire blockchain. This makes it irreversible.</p>
<p>Considering various other transactions waiting for validation in the queue and a number of steps to be fulfilled, it is easy to understand why on-chain transactions take longer to occur successfully. On top of that, there are potentially high fees associated with on-chain transactions. These are the reasons many users would prefer off-chain transactions. However, many projects are working on increasing the speed and reducing the network fees on blockchain transactions to make them more efficient.</p>
<div>Off-chain transactions, on the other hand, occur almost instantly via a few different methods. Without having to wait for confirmations from the blockchain network, transactions are conducted faster. On-chain transactions require validators to validate the transactions and end up costing high fees. While off-chain transactions are usually free or low cost. These transactions aren’t visible on the blockchain, offering more privacy. </div>
<p>Off-chain transactions can occur between two parties by having a transfer agreement. A third party might work as a guarantor to ensure a successful transaction. Today, some payment processors also work along these lines.</p>
<h2>How Are Off-Chain Transactions Carried out?</h2>
<div>Off-chain transactions happening outside a blockchain network can be carried out in different ways. One of the methods is to use payment chains like Bitcoin’s Lightning Network that conduct peer-to-peer transactions. </div>
<div>Another common off-chain transaction method is to swap private keys to an existing wallet. With this method, a new owner is assigned to a specific wallet. This doesn’t alter the blockchain network and is an instant way to perform the transaction.</div>
<div>Some decentralized exchanges (DEX) have adopted the role of an escrow to work as a guarantor between two individuals willing to do an off-chain transaction. P2P trading on Binance is a classic example where a platform is offered to users to exchange a wide range of crypto tokens and pay through a number of off-chain payment methods, including bank transfers, Payoneer, and PayPal. </div>
<p>Typically, off-chain transactions occur among trusted parties or individuals. Because of the time, cost, and privacy advantages, off-chain transactions are becoming popular. However, many crypto projects, like Solana, are working towards low-cost on-chain transactions with a high TPS. </p>

<title>Off-Chain Governance</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/off-chain-governance</url>
<file>off-chain-governance.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Off-chain governance is a type of blockchain governance in which decisions are made informally, away from the primary code base of the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Off-Chain Governance?</h2>
<div>In an off-chain governance network, stakeholders compete for control by collaborating in a variety of ways. Discussions on social media, online forums, conferences, and other events are some popular examples of off-chain governance procedures on public blockchains.</div>
<div>Off-chain governance resembles real-world politics in many ways. Various interest groups aim to take control of the system by playing a series of collaboration games wherein they try to persuade everyone else to support their cause. There is no code that ties these groups to precise actions; rather, they determine what is in their best interests in light of the other stakeholders' known preferences.</div>
<div>Many public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have a governance architecture that is mostly off-chain. All significant modifications suggested to Bitcoin, for example, are extensively discussed online by important parties. The core development team, other developers, miners, researchers, and the end-user community are all significant players. Anyone is welcome to attend Bitcoin's core development team's frequent online meetings.</div>
<div>On closer investigation, Bitcoin appears to have no on-chain governance mechanism. The network lacks a governance token, and while possessing BTC gives you a voice in off-chain conversations, it does not provide you with explicit voting rights. As a result, all conversation and voting take place off-chain</div>
<div>Some people equate huge mining pools' hash power or mining on Bitcoin with governance power. No matter how powerful a Bitcoin miner is, they have no special governance rights. Their only responsibility is to verify or reject transaction blocks. In other words, your portion of mining power on Bitcoin does not equate to a share of governance rights.</div>
<div>The governance model of Ethereum is very similar to that of Bitcoin. There is a core development team led by Vitalik Buterin, who is widely regarded as a hero by the community, researchers, advisers, and miners. </div>
<p>Let's take a closer look at how stakeholders collaborate and make off-chain decisions.</p>
<div>Protocol modifications are provided by core developers through formal improvement requests, similar to on-chain governance. Some examples include Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPs) and Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs), which are suggestions that are often submitted to the project's official repository, which is housed on Microsoft or GitHub.</div>
<div>Through private and community conversation, various stakeholders signal their agreement or disapproval for an improvement suggestion, similar to how game theory works. The core developers then assess if node operators and miners are willing to upgrade their software. In an ideal world, everyone agrees and the code changes move seamlessly. Everything is announced in advance, allowing stakeholders to stay up to date.</div>
<div>Stakeholders have two alternatives in the event of disagreement. First, they can try to persuade the other stakeholders to support their cause. If they can't come to an agreement, they can hard fork the protocol and maintain or change the aspects they believe are important. </div>
<div>Off-chain governance is a solid system that seeks to consider the interests of all stakeholders. However, because decisions aren't legally binding, influence tends to be concentrated among the core developers and miners. </div>

<title>Off-Chain Transaction</title>

<file>off-chain-transaction.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>An off-chain transaction is defined as a second-layer protocol where the transactions occur on a network and move value outside of the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Off-Chain Transaction?</h2>
<div>Unlike an on-chain transaction in which crypto tokens are sent and received within a native blockchain network, an off-chain transaction is a phenomenon that takes place outside of the main blockchain. It is a solution to the slow and costly problems that users face while doing on-chain transactions. </div>
<div>For example, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are all slightly different in their own ways, and they all share the same core DNA as Bitcoin, in a sense that they use a decentralized network to transmit and receive financial transactions, with nodes on these networks verifying each transaction inside the distributed ledger. Regardless of the currency, you choose to experiment with, blockchain technology has made it feasible to send currency around the world beyond regardless of your location.</div>
<div>As a result, people began looking for an alternative, which led to the development of the off-chain transaction with an enhanced second-layer solution that takes place outside of the main blockchain. With the help of these second-layer protocols, one can avoid the issues faced during an on-chain transaction by enabling a cheaper and faster process.</div>
<div>The second layer refers to the projects and protocols that are built on top of a base blockchain to improve the technology and user experience. These solutions are about extending the functionality of a blockchain beyond what its creators originally intended or what it was built to perform. When consumers of a large public blockchain believe it has flaws, they seek the second layer for solutions.</div>
<div>Two parties agree to a debt between them, which is the most basic form of an off-chain transaction. When you agree that you and another participant on the trading platform owe each other one Bitcoin, your agreement is a transaction that remains legitimate because you have mutual confidence.</div>
<div>Nothing touches the blockchain, and the transaction time is instantaneous - all that is required now is some math and you can agree on the balance due. At some time, you may also be able to repay the remaining debt with a single on-chain transaction that represents all of the behavior that led to this one payment.</div>
<div>Users can create a channel and exchange private keys with that wallet, allowing for off-chain fund transfers. They can continue to swap currency as much as they like as long as the channel is open, until they're ready to settle, at which time they can stop the channel and record the final value on-chain.</div>
<div>Off-chain protocols, unlike on-chain networks, are plentiful. The Lightning Network, Liquid Network, and others are among them. </div>
<p>The following are some advantages: </p>
<div>Off-chain transactions, however, have drawbacks. Liquid Network, for example, uses Bitcoin's decentralization for peg-in transactions, whereas it requires Bitcoin to be locked up and each payment channel has a finite capacity.</div>
<div>Off-chain transactions are best for those looking for transactions that are quick, cheap, and discreet. </div>

<preview>A currency that is created (minted) outside of the specified blockchain ledger but is accepted or used.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Off-Ledger Currency?</h2>
<div>An off ledger currency isa currency which does NOT reside on blockchain or other distributed ledgers, which includes all currencies employed by nation states. While an off-ledger currency isn’t developed specifically for a blockchain, they may be used in it thanks to their utility and wide acceptance. For instance, Ripple’s Ripplenet and the Stellar blockchain may be able to transfer and convert off-ledger currencies worldwide via their bridge currencies, XRP and XLM, respectively.</div>
<div>Fiat money is an example of an off-ledger currency since it is issued by the central banks outside blockchain networks. The United States dollar (USD) is a prime example of an off-ledger currency, which is used worldwide because of its worth and is typically held as a reserve currency by most financial institutions. Unlike an on-ledger currency, it is centrally controlled and issued without any limits.</div>
<p>As a consequence, off-ledger currencies do not have any intrinsic value. Rather, their value is derived from a government’s backing and subsequent declaration as legal tender. Central banks’ right to issuance and control fiat money gives them absolute power and influence over the economy. Unfortunately, they can still be counterfeited by malicious actors. And if their issuance is left unchecked, they can incur negative effects to economies. </p>
<div>Unlike an on-ledger currency, they don’t need continuous incentivized computational power (or other consensus mechanism requirements) to exist. Some off-ledger currencies are actually digital fiat equivalents, being used on blockchains like USD or EUR due to their stability and popularity. Fiat-based stablecoins (tokens pegged to the value of nation state currencies) may fall under the definition of off-ledger currencies since their value is still derived from off-ledger currencies.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The act of storing cryptocurrencies in devices or systems not connected to the internet.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Offline Storage?</h2>
<div>Offline storage refers to the storage of private keys of an account and the funds contained within in an offline device, which means it does not maintain a constant and continuous connection with the internet. This is done to prevent unauthorized and/or malicious access to the device, which can result in theft or misuse of user funds. Offline storage ensures that attackers have no way of accessing the device, making it theoretically impossible to steal crucial and sensitive financial information. </div>
<div>This is opposed to online storage, in which data is kept on devices with an active connection to the internet. Despite encryption and other security measures, there is still a possibility of bad actors accessing the private keys of online storage by bypassing or breaking security measures since the device can be attacked without any time constraint. </div>
<p>In contrast, offline storage devices still come online for a brief period when a transaction has to be sent to the network. However, most go offline as soon as it’s done. Even when a cyber thief is able to access a transaction, the thief would not be able to view the private key used for it. This makes it tremendously hard, if not nearly impossible, to attack the device in this short time window.</p>
<p>Typical examples of offline storage devices are hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey, as well as offline devices such as CDs, USBs, offline computers, etc.</p>

<title>Offshore Account</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/offshore-account</url>
<file>offshore-account.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An offshore account is defined as a foreign bank account with assets and investments set outside of your origin country or country of residence.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Offshore Account?</h2>
<div>Having an offshore account is similar to having a bank account at your local bank. You can access it online and send and receive money just like a normal bank account. Debit cards are commonly associated with offshore bank accounts. Outside service businesses also provide offshore prepaid debit cards that can be linked to your offshore account.</div>
<p>For example, an offshore account is one where you live in Germany, but you have an Amazon business that sells things in Australia and a bank account that receives money in the United States.</p>
<p>A local account is not a cubby hole with paper cash labeled with your name. Instead, your bank account is nothing more than computer data stored on the bank's network and backed up on servers all around the world.</p>
<div>Your money is stored on a global computer network so it doesn’t really matter if your account is in the neighborhood or somewhere abroad. </div>
<div>An offshore account can be used for a number of things as these accounts offer several advantages. Some of these include higher profit rates, the ability to hold multiple currencies, different investment choices, financial privacy, asset protection, tax benefits, and more.</div>
<div>Such accounts can accommodate needs for a secure way to keep digital currency or tokens on an app on your phone and a place to convert these currencies into cash.</div>
<div>For individuals wishing to secure their riches, an offshore account can be a great option, since it gives additional levels of anonymity, security, and protection, assuring that your assets are always available to you.</div>
<div>With offshore banking, you are effectively forming a separate entity with the same rights as a regular person when it comes to debts, loans, and liabilities. It can also take on its own obligations and liabilities that are independent of its own assets as a separate entity. The crucial factor here is separation.</div>
<div>These offshore bank account countries are designed to preserve and safeguard depositor information while maintaining the highest level of confidentiality. This level of secrecy is particularly remarkable when it comes to safeguarding assets from domestic litigation. Civil cases, such as divorce and contested estates, for example, are daily struggles in the courts.</div>
<div>Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, and France are among the safest countries to offer such bank accounts in the world, according to top finance periodicals. The required minimum deposits are significant and the banker pays you a personal visit to secure everything.</div>
<div>Opening an offshore account can be complex, and there may be restrictions based on your nationality. As a result, it's critical to enlist the help of a seasoned professional to locate the ideal offshore bank for you.</div>
<div>Trading cryptocurrency through an offshore account makes everything a lot easier. It takes away a lot of difficulties for regular traders, and in some circumstances, it's the only way to truly make it feasible to complete a compliant tax return.</div>

<title>OHM Fork</title>

<file>ohm-fork.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>OlympusDAO or Ohm Forks represent the upgrades to OlympusDAO’s codebase that has given birth to a variety of forked products.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an OHM Fork?</h2>
<div>A fork is a process of making changes to a blockchain protocol's code.</div>
<div>When a blockchain network undergoes major improvements, it results in forks, which splits the blockchain into two where both the variants are different but run parallel to each other. Because the source code is open, everyone understands how the network is built. This also implies that any user can provide ideas for upgrading and repairing the code.</div>
<div>People usually associate the establishment of new forks with the issuance of new cryptocurrencies. The most popular way to create a new cryptocurrency is to start from scratch. You can potentially create a 'fork' in the existing Bitcoin blockchain. This is also apparent with the OlympusDAO codebase, which, with its general codebase, sparked the construction of many additional forks.</div>
<div>Developers updated OlympusDAO's current codebase, resulting in the emergence of a flurry of new coins on the market. Forking on an existing blockchain was the approach used. This method enables the addition of new code to an existing blockchain without entirely rewriting it. </div>
<div>OHM's success drew a large number of imitators. OHM’s system served as a base for the generation of several OHM-related projects. Its innovative technique of sharing liquidity rewards with a large community, as well as its DAO organization, has inspired developers to work on their forks.</div>
<div>OHM's protocol-owned liquidity model has fueled the DeFi 2.0 movement, and its success has inspired imitations such as Wonderland, which is another fork of Olympus. Wonderland’s TIME token which is built on the Avalanche blockchain has achieved significant market capitalization and has been a success so far.</div>
<div>$KLIMA is an official and acknowledged fork of OHM that is also backed by OHM token holders. It is a cryptocurrency based on Polygon and backed by digital carbon credits. The APY, like the OHM coin, is very high, which means that if you make an investment, you may expect massive profits.</div>
<div>AnubisDAO, on the other side, initiated a fork of Olympus DAO, which had become enveloped in mayhem after 13.6K ETH ($60M) had been plundered from the system. The goal was to merge the liquidity bonding mechanism introduced by Olympus with a Shiba Inu token-based treasury.</div>
<div>This is another case of rug pull in which unethical coders go underground by easing their labor with the aid of pre-existing codebases, such as the OHM fork.</div>
<div>The success of Olympus' native token OHM and its features, particularly its liquidity protocol, has spawned a slew of other tokens. The majority of the developers behind these tokens, however, are unknown. The concern is that if the protocol vanishes, we won't know who to blame or how to proceed, which is unsettling.</div>
<p>That problem occurs not just with Olympus DAO, but also with Klima DAO and Wonderland (TIME), a non-official OlympusDAO fork.</p>

<title>On-Balance Volume (OBV)</title>

<file>on-balance-volume-obv.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical trading indicator that forecasts an asset's price movements based on the volume flow.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an On-Balance Volume (OBV)?</h2>
<div>On-balance volume (OBV) is a method of forecasting the price changes in an asset by using the element of volume change. OBV is a compounding indicator that builds up the volume on up days and detracts volume on down days to gauge the purchasing and selling pressure. </div>
<p>According to the OBV principle, the 24-hour volume is deemed ‘up-volume’ when an asset's price closes higher than the previous close. On the other hand, the entire day's volume is deemed ‘down-volume’ when the asset's price closes lower than its previous close. OBV will only operate on markets with exchange volume, just as other volume-based indicators, like the Klinger oscillator, money flow index, and negative volume index.</p>
<div>Joseph Granville is the founder of on-balance volume (OBV) metric. According to him, volume defines how the financial markets work, and the price movements occur based majorly on volume. Granville believed that the price eventually sees a huge spike (upwards or downwards) if the market volume of an asset experiences a sharp increase.</div>
<div>The on balance volume (OBV) can be easily calculated, depending on the closing price. </div>
<p>If the 24-hour closing price is below the previous close price:</p>
<p>If the 24-hour closing price is equal to the previous close price:</p>
<p>If the 24-hour closing price is above the previous close price:</p>
<p>It should be noted that the absolute OBV, in any case, is not important. Rather it is the OBV line that will determine the trends of the market. </p>
<div>A great way to look for resistance breaks is to consider the closing prices that are the main players in the OBV realm. However, the OBV indicator can become useless for a certain period due to sharp volume spikes, and in this case, traders should wait for the settling period (the time between the trades that an order is executed in the market) to be over.</div>
<div>A trend reversal in the bullish or bearish direction can be predicted through divergence signals. They are based on the idea that volume always comes before price (similar to OBV). Therefore, when OBV goes down or closes lower than its previous low, a bearish divergence is formed. A bullish divergence, on the other hand, is when OBV rises and closes on a higher closing price than its previous close.</div>
<div>An important point to note here is that OBV, alone, is not enough to predict the bearish and bullish trends of the market. Other technical indicators, such as MACD, RSI, and ADV, are also needed for such analysis.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is On-Chain?</h2>
<p>A blockchain system is essentially a network that contains a distributed ledger that can be considered as a shared database. The transactions that are recorded on the blockchain itself and shared with all of the participants are done on-chain.</p>
<p>Whenever a new transaction is conducted, a new block needs to be added to the blockchain, and there are consensus protocols that need to be followed in order for the transaction to be considered a valid one.</p>
<p>On-chain transactions are transactions that occur on a blockchain, which are reflected on the distribution as well as the public ledger. The on-chain transactions are those that have already been validated as well as authenticated by the miners or authenticators. These can in turn lead to an overall update to the blockchain network itself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for an on-chain transaction to be complete, there has to be an agreed number of confirmations by the miners, where the time it takes for an on-chain transaction to complete also depends on the network congestion. Sometimes transactions are delayed if there is a large volume of transactions that need to be confirmed.</p>
<p>When we compare this to off-chain transactions, this is the second variation when it comes to transaction variation. They differ in a number of ways: off-chain transaction agreements happen actually outside of the blockchain, and this protocol employed with off-chain transactions is similar to that which is used on payment platforms, one of the most popular ones being PayPal.</p>
<p>This means that the parties which are involved in the transaction have the ability to pick an agreement outside of the blockchain, and the next step can potentially involve a third party whose role is to confirm the completion of the transaction as well as certify that the agreement has been obeyed by both parties.</p>

<title>On-Chain Governance</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/on-chain-governance</url>
<file>on-chain-governance.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>On-chain governance is a decentralized framework used for organizing and integrating updates/improvements to the blockchain networks.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is On-Chain Governance?</h2>
<div>On-chain governance gives users the ability to vote directly to change the underlying protocol in blockchain governance. The duty of controlling protocol updates, upgrades, and bug fixes is delegated to the community rather than a centralized party.</div>
<p>The two types of decisions that make up blockchain governance are: 1) the rules underlying the protocol, which is the code, 2) and the network's incentive system, which is the economics.</p>
<div>Blockchain governance can be difficult because it is a decentralized system. On-chain governance is especially useful in distributed cloud-based architectures, where agility is necessary to ensure proper resource allocation. For instance, DFINITY networks provide an on-chain governance approach that is coupled with a proprietary AI system to efficiently assign computing power to various companies and applications connected to their cloud architecture.</div>
<p>Tezos and Decred, for example, are platforms that allow users to vote directly on the platform’s future direction and adjust specific parts to satisfy the needs of both developers and users. </p>
<div>Whereas cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, employ a far more moderate and off-chain method, which has proven to be smart thus far but lacks the flexibility that businesses want.</div>
<div>The on-chain governance has also helped with the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). DAO is a community-run platform wherein the rules enforced are agreed upon by users. DAOs can become crucial apps for organizations with on-chain governance, allowing customers to interact with their product and customize it to their needs quickly, with no overhead expenses from the entity that launches the application.</div>
<p>On-chain governance works on three mechanisms: </p>
<h2>Consensus</h2>
<p>Voting is done directly via the protocol in the case of on-chain governance. The consensus technique is equal to a direct democratic voting mechanism where decisions are made directly on the distributed ledger protocol and blockchain improvements are implemented.</p>
<h2>Incentive</h2>
<div>To level the playing field for all players, there is a shift in control from miners to developers, and subsequently to users.</div>
<div>Users and developers, for example, can advocate for modifications that would substantially reduce transaction costs, putting miners at a disadvantage and making the network unsustainable economically. Similarly, miners can advocate for upgrades that would dramatically increase block rewards, potentially harming the network in the long term.</div>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>The on-chain calls for transparency of information just like off-chain governance. The following are the key advantages of on-chain governance:</p>
<p>The decision-making approach is effective and decentralized because it is not influenced by a single person rather it is achieved through the community.</p>
<p>There is also more transparency because everyone can look at the code and see how consensus is established and decisions are made.</p>
<div>Hard forks can also be avoided. When some stakeholders feel alienated from the decision-making process and are unable to reach an agreement with other organizations on the network's future path, hard forks might occur. </div>
<p>Additionally, on-chain governance is performed by voting through tokens, and incentives for engaging in the voting process are offered to encourage user participation. </p>

<h2>What Is an On-Ledger Currency?</h2>
<div>An on-ledger currency refers to a currency residing on a blockchain. This is the basis of all cryptocurrencies, which must utilize a distributed ledger (a single copy of the same database) shared among all participants.</div>
<div>On-ledger currencies have the potential to become a better alternative to the off-ledger currencies or fiat. They are usually open, transparent (display transactions and balances for everyone to see), pseudo-anonymous (no direct recognition of the user), require continuous and incentivized provision of computational power (or other consensus mechanism requirements) to maintain form/function, impossible to counterfeit and decentralized. Furthermore, they are stored in digital wallets.</div>
<div>Bitcoin is the first and prime example of an on-ledger currency, though there currently exists many such currencies. An on-ledger currency is significant in the sense that it’s not possible for any single party or group of people with considerable influence to change its parameters. This means that an on-ledger currency must typically be devoid of centralized control.</div>
<div>They are classified on the basis of their supply, public or private nature of database, consensus mechanism used, community, extent of usage, liquidity, emission rate, wallet support and other attributes. An on-ledger currency can also be forked, due to the open-source nature of a blockchain code, and be used to start a new on-ledger currency with modified parameters.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is One Cancels the Other Order (OCO)?</h2>
<p>OTOC is a type of exchange order in which its execution results in the cancellation of the other order, hence, the self-explanatory One Cancels The Other (OTOC) order name. An OTOC is a type of conditional order, similar to limit and stop loss orders, where sell or buy actions are automatically executed when a certain trading price threshold is reached or exceeded.</p>
<p>An OTOC typically contains one stop order and one limit order. As soon as one gets executed for meeting a particular criteria, the other one becomes void. It is a complex trading tool used by professional traders that helps them to either cash in on a soaring price or limit their losses if the market plunges. </p>
<div>Limit orders are used to buy or sell shares of an asset when a certain limit (a specified price range) is reached on the market. Stop orders, on the other hand, are used to place buy or sell limits as well, but in the opposite direction. Their execution involves selling an asset if the price starts to fall in order to stop losses, or buying an asset if the price starts to rise in order to profit from a run. </div>
<div>An OTOC order allows traders to operate effectively in a rather volatile market. They can be used to specify a range for maximizing profits and minimizing losses. If a trader is trying to trade Bitcoin (BTC) at a particularly volatile time, they can place two orders to sell at an expected high price or to mitigate losses if the price goes down at a certain point. For instance, if the price of Bitcoin is currently $18,000, a user can place a high sell order at $19,000 and a stop-loss sell order at $17,000 if the market moves in the opposite direction. The same can be done for buy orders as well. </div>
<p>It should be noted that OTOC orders require skillful execution and a deep understanding of the market and trading methods.</p>

<h2>What Is Online Storage?</h2>
<div>Online storage refers to the storage of private keys of a crypto account and the funds contained within in an online device or server, which maintains a constant and continuous connection with the internet. Online storage devices provide easy accessibility and convenient usage, but they also make it possible for attackers to access the device, giving them the ability to steal crucial and sensitive information.</div>
<div>However, they remain a popular way to store assets for new users thanks to their user-friendly interface. In addition, they can allow faster operations and more features on-the-fly as compared to offline storage devices.</div>
<div>While online storage is convenient, it is less secure than offline or cold storage, in which data is kept on devices like hardware wallets that have no active connection to the internet and therefore cannot be remotely hacked. </div>
<p>Online storage devices remain connected to the internet most of the time, not only when a transaction has to be sent to the network, which increases the time window for attackers to penetrate. They may go offline when a user shuts them down and or turns off their internet connection. </p>
<div>Fortunately, online storage devices and servers are still protected by encryption and other security measures. They include browser-based wallets like MetaMask, mobile-based wallets like Enjin and Trust Wallet, and PC/Laptop-based online wallets like Coinomi and Coinspot.</div>

<preview>Ontorand Consensus Engine is the VBFT consensus mechanism on the Ontology blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Ontorand Consensus Engine (Ontology)?</h2>
<p>Ontorand Consensus Engine is VBFT (Verifiable Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus mechanism on the Ontology blockchain.</p>
<div>VBFT is a combination of proof of stake, verifiable random function, and byzantine fault tolerance. Conventional blockchain requires each node in the network to have a complete copy of the blockchain, thus making it hard for the nodes to scale. By combining proof of stake, VRF, and BFT, the Ontology Consensus Engine (OCE) creates a blockchain that can theoretically allow near-infinite scalability, excellent security and speed.</div>
<p>Ontology blockchain is a public blockchain project and distributed trust collaboration platform. It makes decentralized trust systems available to everyone, connecting different blockchains, improving the efficiency of business applications, and providing mainstream users with the ability to use public blockchains without having to know about their technical implementations. </p>
<div>As the Ontorand Consensus Engine operates on VBFT (Verifiable Blockchain Fault Tolerance) technology, the processing power of consensus is doubled to mitigate faults. It uses the proof-of-work algorithm and ensures nodes verify transactions on the VBFT blockchain by making them perform computations on it.  </div>
<p>The VRF is part of an innovative cryptographic scheme that uses pairings to create a new, equally secure but much simpler function. It is more powerful than traditional two-party protocols such as those that rely on Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), and in many cases, it provides the same level of security with fewer steps.</p>
<p>Byzantine fault tolerance is a fault-tolerant consensus protocol. The algorithm ensures that if an arbitrary number of processes fail, the system still works. This is critical for distributed systems, where we cannot rely on a central server to dictate and validate the execution of a networked application. The term byzantine fault tolerance is used to describe fault-tolerance in computer systems in which failures may be caused by Byzantine faults (i.e., arbitrary faults that are not due to faulty hardware alone, such as software crashes). This is in contrast to the use of more typical terms like &quot;fault tolerance&quot;, which implies that only failed hardware is held to be a source of potentially erroneous behavior.</p>
<div>What differentiates VBFT from other consensus algorithms is its tight integration with the governance model of the Ontology blockchain. It’s adapted to operate on the defined parameters of Ontology without affecting the randomness and fairness of the consensus process. With the help of VBFT,  public blockchains can improve both performance and scalability. It consequently allows dApp developers to bring out their creativity the best way – the blockchain ecosystem relies on dApp developers hugely. VBFT has a long way to go and it’ll only improve with time.  </div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Open source is a philosophy, with participants believing in the free and open sharing of information in pursuit of the greater common good.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Open Source?</h2>
<p>Open source refers to the open nature of a software or code, which are deemed by the copyright holders or the creators to be open for inspection, duplication and modification. Being open source allows users to use, analyze, modify, change and distribute the software or the code, as per their requirements and needs, for anything without restrictions. This ensures that end-users are able to use the software freely without having to face any lawsuit or other liabilities from the original developers. However, open source doesn’t necessarily mean free, and developers can still charge for services, namely consultancy and troubleshooting, among others.</p>
<div>Most of the crypto projects and code are open source, which allows them to be easily inspected, verified for integrity, and modified without any restrictions. Furthermore, open source has enabled widespread interest from the developer community, who are able to create new projects by modifying the parameters of existing ones and adding new functionality. For instance, Bitcoin forks like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) were created from the original Bitcoin source code with differing block sizes and other changes.</div>
<div>The open source spirit of the crypto space has allowed an explosion of innovation that hasn’t been seen since the advent of the internet, bringing new concepts to life including stablecoins, DeFi and non-fungible tokens, among others.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The price at which a cryptocurrency opens at a time period or the programming principle of software parts being extendable.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Open/Close?</h2>
<p>Open/close can refer to the price at which a cryptocurrency opens at a time period, for example at the start of the day; the price at which a cryptocurrency closes at a time period, for example at the end of the day. In general, these terms were more useful in traditional financial markets as there are fixed hours of the day in which trading occurs.</p>
<div>In software development, open/close refers to the programming principle of software parts (functions, modules etc.) being extendable without allowing any kind of change in the source code. The code itself permits flexibility while restricting the ability to change its fundamental parts. This eliminates the need to change the software completely every time when new requirements arise. It was first described by Bertrand Meyer and forms part of the SOLID principle of object-oriented programming. Open/close is especially important for blockchain and crypto projects design because of their immutable nature.</div>
<div>Blockchain and its parameters aren’t easily changeable once implemented. This is because any change has to be agreed by all nodes and participants of the network and a consensus needs to be formed, which isn’t exactly easy. For that reason, blockchain platforms and decentralized applications are typically only changeable through a hard fork, which means starting on a new chain. </div>
<p>Hard forks are an inconvenient procedure and quite risky for users. It’s not practical for projects to hard fork every time they need to pursue changes and add/modify functionalities. Hence, blockchain programming relies heavily on the open/close principle, which means leaving room for extending capabilities without causing drastic changes.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is OpenSea?</h2>
<div>OpenSea is a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace for buying, selling and trading rare digital goods, from gaming items to collectibles to art, which are built on non-fungible token (NFT) technology and run on the Ethereum blockchain. In fact, OpenSea brands itself as the largest marketplace for digital goods as it has a broad range of available items in over 200 categories and claims to have the best prices for new items.</div>
<div>OpenSea allows the trading of digital art, decentralized domain names, trading cards, virtual worlds, digital collectibles, sports NFTs, utility NFTs, you name it. It is the go-to platform for some of the most popular NFT projects like Cryptopunks, Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained, CryptoKitties, SuperRare, etc.</div>
<div>Notably, OpenSea allows anyone to trade NFTs in the global market yet takes no custody for any items listed on its marketplace. Instead, the marketplace enables trading through a smart contract while users store their items in their chosen wallet. Furthermore, users are allowed to list their items on OpenSea even if they are also listed in other marketplaces as long as they remain in their wallets.</div>
<p>OpenSea merely provides an open platform for users to trade while taking only 2.5% of the purchase price of every NFT sold, which the platform boasts as the lowest in the space as of April 2021.</p>
<div>Lastly, ETH is the default cryptocurrency used for purchasing, but OpenSea accepts over 200 payment options including DAI, USDC, REVV, SAND, MANA, wBTC, MEME, and many more.</div>

<title>Opera Mainnet (Fantom)</title>

<file>opera-mainnet-fantom.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Opera (Fantom) is a permissionless, open-source framework that allows everyone to engage in the network through staking and governance.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Opera Mainnet (Fantom)?</h2>
<div>Opera, the Fantom mainnet, was established in December of 2019, making it one of the most recent functional blockchains. Opera is a permissionless, open-source framework that allows everyone to engage in the network through staking and governance.</div>
<div>The Fantom's native token is FTM. Within the network, it is utilized for staking, on-chain governance, and platform fees. Fantom employs the Lachesis consensus, which combines the Proof-of-Stake and Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus mechanisms for faster and cheaper transactions in comparison to other blockchains, and provides a highly secure environment.</div>
<h2>What Distinguishes Fantom From the Competition?</h2>
<div>First-generation and second-generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, were not designed to scale. Security and decentralization were their primary concerns. The network's transaction rates got slow as a result, especially as more nodes were added. A transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain network, for example, may take up to 15 minutes, but transactions on the Fantom network can be completed in a matter of seconds.</div>
<div>Fantom used the unique Lachesis consensus to solve the “blockchain trilemma” of balancing speed, security, and decentralization.</div>
<div>Lachesis' PoS mechanism, like any other PoS blockchain, allows validators to produce new blocks by staking their FTM. The aBFT protocol, on the other hand, is a key aspect of the Lachesis consensus since it allows nodes to construct blocks independently.</div>
<p>Even if there are broken or malicious nodes in the network, the Byzantine Fault Tolerance method allows for consensus. It could theoretically manage up to one-third of malfunctioning or malicious nodes without causing a network outage.</p>
<p>As a result, nodes can establish agreement on their own via a two-stage block confirmation procedure as long as they obtain a majority of two-thirds. This eliminates the need for a leader node to create blocks, allowing for speedier transactions while retaining excellent security.</p>
<p>Because the blocks in the Fantom network are self-contained, it is more decentralized. Every decentralized application runs on its own blockchain, which is linked to the Lachesis consensus.</p>
<h2>What Is the Fantom Virtual Machine?</h2>
<div>The Fantom Virtual Machine is used on the mainnet of Fantom Opera. This is Fantom's software development kit that provides the tools to create and deploy Decentralized Finance apps (also known as dApps on the network.</div>
<div>Furthermore, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is also supported by Opera. It enables developers to migrate their Ethereum-based decentralized apps effortlessly to the Fantom network, ensuring compatibility with the world's largest smart contract-based platform.</div>
<h2>What Is Lachesis?</h2>
<div>Fantom employs its own consensus technique dubbed Lachesis, rather than replicating the proof-of-work (PoW) processes used in Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the project's creators, Lachesis enables Fantom to run significantly quicker and be more scalable than previous blockchains. The Fantom network's proponents claim that it is ideal for applications that require a lot of throughput because of its speed.</div>
<div>An asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT) consensus mechanism is what Lachesis is renowned for. Fantom's creators claim that they have found a solution to the long-standing difficulty of scaling blockchains without sacrificing other important characteristics of the networks, such as decentralization and security. One of Lachesis' primary advantages over Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (pBFT) consensus systems is its resistance to distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS). Furthermore, aBFT systems are designed to be faster than pBFT-based consensus methods.</div>
<div>It should be noted that aBFT also employs Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which is common in other emerging blockchain consensus systems. Each network node keeps a local DAG, which is later used to compute the final order of events. Unlike previous blockchain systems, transaction events are compared to other nodes on the network rather than the blocks themselves.</div>
<p>The scalability trilemma, which stipulates that only two of three requirements may be included in consensus algorithms at the same time, has been effectively overcome.</p>
<h2>Fantom’s Architecture</h2>
<p>The Opera Core, Opera Ware, and Application Layer are the three layers that make up the Fantom architecture, like a sandwich.</p>
<div>The bottom bun in the Lachesis Protocol is Opera Core, which is responsible for maintaining consensus amongst nodes. Each transaction is kept on each node, however, Fantom is unusual in that it requires a second type of node called a witness node to validate transactions and relies on the dPOS technique to choose validating nodes. Additionally, in order to operate a validator, users must have at least 1,000,000 FTM.</div>
<p>Opera Ware is the protocol's &quot;meat&quot; that allows it to carry out tasks such as giving incentives and creating 'Story Data.'</p>
<p>The sesame-seed bun known as Opera Application has publicly available APIs that allow developers to connect with the Opera Ware layer through their dApps. Furthermore, an intriguing application that develops from it is 'Story Data,' which is a fundamental function for keeping indefinite and vast recordings of data that are critical, vital for applications such as supply-chain management.</p>

<title>Operating System (OS)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/operating-system-os</url>
<file>operating-system-os.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>An operating system (OS) is a software and a resource manager that sits between the hardware and the user.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Operating System (OS)?</h2>
<p>Operating systems are software programs that manage the resources of a computer. It is the software that lets apps communicate with a computer's hardware.</p>
<p>The program may communicate directly with the hardware. However, most software programs are not developed to communicate with a specific piece of hardware; instead, the operating system does it.</p>
<p>Operating systems were not available on the first computers. Every computer program had to incorporate all of the code needed to run and connect with the hardware, as well as accomplish the program's real function. As a result, computer programs became difficult to develop and too complicated to operate. Each software could only be executed on the specific computer for which it was designed.</p>
<h2>Functions of Operating System</h2>
<p>Operating systems conduct a variety of functions in order to fulfill the aims. These aims are as follows:</p>
<div>Process Management: At any one point in time, the CPU may have a number of processes in the ready state. However, a processor can only handle one process at a time. As a result, the CPU should employ procedures to make sure that operations have continuous and smooth access to resources. It should not prioritize any one process over another and ensure that all processes in the ready state get performed. First come, first serve, round-robin, shortest job first, priority scheduling, and other CPU scheduling techniques are examples.</div>
<p>Memory Management: To run a process, the entire process is loaded into the main memory, which is then performed. After the process is completed, the memory is released and may be utilized for other processes. As a result, it is the operating system's responsibility to manage memory by allocating and deallocating memory for the process.</p>
<p>I/O Device Management: In a system, there are many different I/O devices. Various processes require access to various resources; however, these devices should not be accessed directly by the process. As a result, it is the operating system's responsibility to authorize the usage of I/O devices by the processes that require them.</p>
<p>File Management: Each computer has its own set of files, folders, and directory structure. All of these are maintained and handled by the computer's operating system. A File Allocation Table, or FAT, is used to keep track of all of these files' information. As a result, the File Allocation Table stores every detail about the file, such as the filename, file size, file type, and so on. It is also the responsibility of the operating system to ensure that the files are not opened by unauthorized users.</p>
<p>Virtual Memory: When the size of the application exceeds the main memory, the operating system is responsible for loading only frequently used pages into the main memory. This is referred to as Virtual Memory. </p>
<h2>What Are the Most Popular Operating Systems?</h2>
<p>The following is a list of examples of several computer operating systems throughout the history of computing.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>GPOS refers to the operating systems listed below (general-purpose operating systems). Examples of RTOS may be found in our RTOS (real-time operating system) description.</p>

<title>Optimistic Oracle</title>

<file>optimistic-oracle.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>An optimistic oracle uses a dispute/arbitration process to ensure data accuracy.  This compares to a price-feed oracle, which relies on nodes to provide consistent price feed data on-chain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Optimistic Oracle?</h2>
<div>An optimistic oracle is an oracle where real-world data is integrated with decentralized systems (e.g. blockchains), and the data is accepted as true if it is not disputed during a certain period. The “optimistic” design differs from a price-feed oracle, where prices are streamed on-chain but without any recourse or error protection.</div>
<p>Because of the unique design, optimistic oracles can be used in different ways than price-feed oracles. In addition to the price of an asset, they can serve arbitrary data, and “long-tail” information requests that might not be feasible for price-feed oracles to support.</p>
<div>The optimistic oracle also protects smart contracts and users against manipulation of the external data feed, since incorrect data can be disputed. This is a unique feature, as other oracle solutions are only as secure as their data feed.                </div>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>An optimistic rollup is a type layer 2 scaling solution that relies on off-chain computation to trustlessly record transactions that happen in the layer 2.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Optimistic Rollup?</h2>
<p>An optimistic rollup is a type layer 2 scaling solution that relies on off-chain computation to trustlessly record transactions that happen in the layer 2. Periodically the system publishes a merkle root of the transactions that happen within the rollup in order to update the &quot;state&quot; of the rollup on the main underlying blockchain. A network of external validators checks the Merkle roots to make sure that they are correct, before the state is updated some time later. If an inconsistency arises, then the validator can publish a fraud proof during the dispute period, which can cause the state of the system to be rolled back to the previous valid state. </p>
<p>The main downside to optimistic rollups compared to zero knowledge rollups is the time that it takes for layer 2 users to be able to withdraw their funds back to the underlying blockchain. As an optimistic rollup has to rely on external validators to check the merkle roots for ‘cheating’ before the state can be updated, there needs to be a sufficient amount of time for validators to check and challenge the activity that has happened on layer 2. </p>
<p>The main advantage to optimistic rollups compared to their zero knowledge equivalents is that they are more generalist and can support smart contracts in a similar way to the underlying smart contract enabled blockchain. Native support for smart contracts within the rollup means that apps can be launched much easier, without the need for additional development.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Option?</h2>
<p>An option is a derived financial agreement which allows its holder to buy or sell an asset without requiring a commitment. Options have a set price, called a strike price, and an expiration date. They can be used in the trading of cryptocurrencies, indexes, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), among others. Rules governing option trading depend on an option’s style.</p>
<p>Basically, there are two option styles; American and European. The difference between the two lies in how holders interact with the instrument between purchase and expiration time. For example, American-styled options give their holders the freedom to buy or sell on or before the expiration date. On the other hand, European-styled options only allow holders to execute their rights on the expiration date.  </p>
<div>In the options space, buy and sell activities are referred to as call and put respectively. A call signal is a sign that an option holder can buy an asset at a predetermined price and time. Put and call option strategies work in opposites of each other. Note that options are traded in the options market. Although these financial instruments have a high level of risk compared to spot trading, they have several advantages.</div>
<p>For instance, they can help investors to efficiently deploy funds consequently, maximizing their returns. Additionally, due to their reduced financial obligation, they can be less risky than futures and other types of financial instruments. Options are highly flexible, allowing for the creation of synthetics, and thus, expanding investment alternatives.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Options Market?</h2>
<p>The options market is a public place to trade options. It provides cryptocurrency traders with a place to buy or sell digital currencies at a set price and time. Basic terms used in the market include call/put options and strike price. Call and put options are opposites. To elaborate, we can equate call options to buy orders and have a predetermined price and date.</p>
<div>Options market participants buy calls when the price of a tracked asset is projected to increase in value. In contrast, investors place sell calls when the market has a bearish outlook.</div>
<p>Put options, on the other hand, are sell orders. As such, they indicate a willingness by an option holder to liquidate their position. The predetermined price is called a strike price. Note that either American or European option rules govern the options market.</p>
<p>Apart from the above terms, an options trader needs to understand other words such as Greeks. Greeks are symbols that outline the risks during options trading. For instance, the delta symbol shows a change in the price of a tracked asset against a single dollar.</p>
<p>Theta, on the other hand, is used in the market to indicate a shift between the price of an option and time. It is sometimes called the time decay of an option. Gamma is another prominent symbol in the options market. It shows the change between an option’s delta and the price of a tracked asset. Other Greeks used in the market include vega and rho.</p>

<file>oracle-manipulation.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Oracle manipulation is when an oracle smart contract is manipulated by hackers.</preview>
<description>
<div>Oracle manipulation, or oracle price manipulation, is an exploit most common in the DeFi space where an oracle smart contract is manipulated by attackers, which leads to system failure, theft and other damages. DeFi networks are reported to have lost over $33 million due to price oracle manipulation in 2020 alone.</div>
<p>Oracles are third-party service providers that supply blockchains with external or real-world data such as price feeds, weather information, statistics, etc. Price feeds are by far the most exploited oracle data since they allow attackers to steal millions of funds from DeFi platforms. </p>
<div>Generally, there are two ways an oracle can gather price information. One is to seamlessly siphon price data from centralized exchanges via APIs. On the other hand, oracles can also do the calculations themselves by consulting decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Both methods have their own sets of advantages and disadvantages, as well as ways of being manipulated.</div>
<div>In the Harvest Finance hack, the culprit was able to penetrate its pools through a flash loan using a form of oracle manipulation. Basically, the hacker reduced the value of USDC within the Curve pool via a trade. Then, the perpetrator got into the Harvest pool at the deflated price, brought USDC back to its initial price reversing his trade, then exited the pool at a much higher price.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Are Oracles?</h2>
<div>Oracles are entities that interface real-world data with decentralized systems. In the decentralized environment, oracles are prominent with blockchain-based products. They give blockchains the ability to interact with off-chain data.</div>
<div>With Ethereum and other decentralized platforms powering the use of smart contracts, accessing data outside these systems bridges the conventional and decentralized environment. Note that oracles are not data sources by themselves. Instead, they collect, query, verify and validate data from different sources and deliver them to smart contracts.</div>
<div>Transmitted data can range from price feeds, payments, temperature from a sensor, scores from a football game, etc. Mostly, oracles are classified based on where they draw their data (software/hardware), the flow of information between them and their sources (inbound/outbound), and whether they’re decentralized or centralized.</div>
<p>Software and hardware oracles fetch data from different sources. For example, software oracles get data from internet-based services such as servers and databases, while hardware oracles receive data from information-reading gadgets such as barcode scanners.</p>
<p>Inbound oracles deliver off-chain data to smart contracts while their outbound counterparts relay information from contracts to the real world. Oracles that rely on a single data provider are centralized while those that interact with multiple sources are considered decentralized.</p>
<div>Most crypto proponents would refer to Chainlink (LINK) and Band Protocol (BAND) as quintessential examples of decentralized oracle networks.</div>
<p>Although multiple contracts and decentralized systems can reference one oracle, there are contract-specific oracles built to serve a single smart contract. Note that individuals with unique subject knowledge can fetch, verify, and validate data for use by blockchain-based agreements. These are known as human oracles.</p>

<h2>What Is An Order Book?</h2>
<div>An order book is an electronic documentation of an asset’s buy and sell activity on a trading platform such as a cryptocurrency exchange. Generally, an order book shows a sleek view of a particular asset by recording buy and sell orders. Platforms using electronic order books employ a matching engine to automatically sift and fulfill buy and sell orders, whether wholly or partially.</div>
<p>An order book comprises different key information regarding an asset. First, it has dedicated sections for buyers and sellers. Next, there is a bid and ask section. Here, &quot;asks&quot; represent sell requests while &quot;bids&quot; indicate buy orders.</p>
<p>Bids are placed on the left while asks occupy the right side of the book. Both sides have buy and sell prices from various traders. Bids are usually represented by a green color while asks are colored red.</p>
<div>Tables, line charts, bar charts and other visualization methods display the interaction between buyers and sellers. Also, Japanese candlesticks charting accompanies an order book to show the current and past status of the market and to help traders make informed trading decisions. In most cases, order books only contain orders set to be fulfilled using a trader’s specific prices.</div>
<p>These types of orders are known as limit orders. Orders placed to be fulfilled using the current market prices are called market orders. Highest bid prices and lowest ask prices appear at the top of the order book. The difference between these two prices is referred to as the bid-ask spread. It indicates the supply and demand strength.</p>

<preview>A valid block on the blockchain that is not part of the main chain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Orphan?</h2>
<div>An orphan is a legitimate block that is not part of the main blockchain. It is also called a stale or detached block. There are various factors that could cause orphaned blocks. Key among them include internet lags, the length of a blockchain, block size and the speed of the node housing the blockchain. These factors cause two blocks to have the same timestamp leading to the main blockchain rejecting one block and absorbing the other.</div>
<div>The time-lapse can occur in a situation where two miners in the Bitcoin blockchain, for instance, simultaneously find, solve and propagate a block. Due to the above factors, the two blocks are seen by different nodes at different times.</div>
<p>As more blocks arrive, nodes will add them to the chain they consider valid. The Bitcoin blockchain automatically believes that the longer chain is the valid one. Therefore, one between the two blocks will, despite being accurate, be an orphan (the shorter chain).</p>
<div>Blockchain developers reduce the presence of orphans by factoring in the propagation delay and block time. An orphan is likely to occur if the decentralized platform has a high propagation delay and a short block time. Note that too many competing blocks could also cause forks, hence, the introduction of competing chains. These chains lead to unstable or stuck decentralized networks.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is an Orphaned Block?</h2>
<p>An orphaned block is a block where the parent block does not exist or is unknown. These types of orphaned blocks are formed in older versions of the Bitcoin core software, where the network nodes had the ability to receive blocks even despite the lack of data about their ancestor.</p>
<p>Now, since the release of what is known as the Bitcoin Core v.0.10 in early 2015, Bitcoin orphaned blocks are an impossibility.</p>
<p>The term orphaned block is still used in the world of cryptocurrencies and it refers to valid minted blocks that have been discarded. These blocks can be called stale blocks or extinct blocks; however, because the client denotes their block rewards as orphaned, many people refer to them as orphaned blocks instead. Despite them having a known parent block, people still refer to them as orphaned blocks rather than stale blocks, but you should know the difference between them nonetheless.</p>
<p>An orphaned block is generated when two different miners relay their valid blocks at almost the exact same time, which causes the network to split into two competing versions of the blockchain until one of the blocks ends up being discarded. The longest chain prevails while the other is abandoned as a general rule; while both blocks are verified and valid in this case, only one of them can be attached to the main chain.</p>
<p>Now, given the fact that miners are constantly generating new blocks around the clock, certain blocks can be broadcasted onto the network simultaneously, and given the fact that the network itself is distributed, the transmission of this information between nodes can take quite a long time. As a result of this, a possibility exists that a group of nodes will end up choosing to validate one block, while another group will choose to validate another. This is what would cause one of the blocks to end up being orphaned.</p>

<file>ouroboros-praos.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Ouroboros Praos is a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism developed by IOHK and is an updated version of Ouroboros Classic.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Ouroboros Praos?</h2>
<div>Ouroboros Praos is an improvement over Ouroboros Classic, the first version of the consensus protocol developed by IOHK. It was the first proof-of-stake algorithm to be formally proven secure in a rigorous cryptographic model.</div>
<div>Ouroboros Praos improves upon classic's security guarantees, introducing a novel &quot;layered&quot; approach to the protocol, which allows it to scale gracefully with the size of the network. The algorithm is provably secure in the asynchronous setting, making a common and standard cryptographic assumption</div>
<p>Praos is not only a technically superior protocol but also one that is easier for developers to integrate into their applications in comparison to its predecessors. As such, it has been selected for implementation in Cardano.</p>
<p>The Ouroboros Praos proof-of-stake protocol is the second iteration of Ouroboros, the first provably secure proof-of-stake protocol, developed by IOHK’s research team. Like Ouroboros Genesis, Ouroboros Praos is a provably secure proof-of-stake blockchain protocol, which allows users to run a node and mint new blocks when they are randomly selected.</p>
<p>Praos stands for “self-sufficient”, as this iteration of the protocol provides stronger guarantees than Ouroboros Genesis in terms of scalability and security. As with all IOHK research papers, this has been published in an academic journal (the Journal of Cryptographic Engineering).</p>
<div>Ouroboros Praos operates on a two-tier system: the main chain is comprised of epochs (collections of blocks), and each epoch contains slots (opportunities to mint blocks). The time taken for each epoch depends on the total number of stake pools on the network.</div>
<p>The main advantage of having pool operators (who run stake pools) as part of the system is that it makes the network more accessible. </p>
<p>One of the main differences between Ouroboros and Ouroboros Praos is what they each require from their individual staking pools.</p>
<p>With Ouroboros, every pool needed to have a single leader that was responsible for producing blocks. This meant that every pool required at least one account in order to start staking, which means that all of the computational work was done by that one account.</p>
<p>With Ouroboros Praos, however, pools don't need to have a leader. They can instead share responsibilities with all accounts in the pool. This means that computational work can be shared amongst multiple accounts instead of just one, so there's less pressure put on anyone's account.</p>
<p>The other two forms of the Ouroboros algorithm are Ouroboros Genesis and Ouroboros Classic.</p>
<p>Ouroboros Genesis uses a verifiable random function (VRF) in addition to the traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism used in Ouroboros Classic. VRF is a cryptographic primitive that allows a party to generate a random output at any time and get it publicly verified by other parties. In the context of Ouroboros, VRF is used to determine the leader that commits blocks to the ledger in each slot. VRF improves our ability to provide security and decentralization for Ouroboros Genesis, compared with Ouroboros Classic. Additionally, this enables Ouroboros Genesis to be more scalable than Ouroboros Classic for certain adversarial models.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Over-Collateralization (OC)?</h2>
<p>Over-collateralization (OC) is the provision of collateral that is worth more than enough to cover potential losses in cases of default. It is used to effectively manage risk and involves placing an asset as collateral on a loan where the value of the asset exceeds the value of the loan. </p>
<p>An over-collateralized stablecoins has a large number of cryptocurrency tokens maintained as a reserve for issuing a lower number of stablecoins. This offers a buffer against price fluctuations. </p>
<div>DAI, for example, has a loan and repayment process utilizing a collateralized debt position via MakerDAO to secure assets as collateral on-chain. Users can deposit Ether or other accepted cryptocurrencies and can borrow against the value of their deposits to receive newly generated DAI. </div>
<p>Collateralizing stablecoins, as they grow in demand and adoption, is not always efficient as it means collateral sitting idle could be used more productively elsewhere. Today we are seeing new innovations where stablecoins, with algorithmic controllers, can issue more coins when the price increases and buy them off the market when the price calls. This algorithmic manipulation of supply to change the price removes the requirement of collateral backing. </p>
<div>Author: Travis Moore, CTO of Frax </div>
<p>Bio: Travis Moore is an angel investor, programmer, entrepreneur and the CTO of Frax, the world’s first fractional algorithmic stablecoin that is partially backed by collateral and stabilized algorithmically. Frax is open-source and permissionless, bringing a truly trustless, scalable and stable asset to the future of decentralized finance. Moore is also co-founder of the blockchain based knowledge base, Everipedia. Moore has a triple-major from UCLA in Neuroscience, Biochemistry and Molecular, Cell, &amp; Developmental Biology. His passions are artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, which he believes are the two industries that will impact the world the most in the coming decade.</p>

<title>Over-the-Counter (OTC)</title>

<file>over-the-counter-otc.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Over-the-counter is defined as a transaction made outside of an exchange, often peer-to-peer through private trades.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Over-the-Counter (OTC)?</h2>
<div>Over-the-counter (OTC), also called off-exchange trading, is a transaction conducted outside of a traditional trading platform through the help of intermediaries. Often, OTC trading is preferred by private traders as it usually involves huge transactions and offers more flexibility and better pricing than exchanges can offer. Equities and cryptocurrency derivatives are among financial instruments that are tradable over the counter.</div>
<div>OTC is not limited to deep-pocketed private traders though, and over-the-counting trading is also prominent in jurisdictions where, for example, cryptocurrency exchanges are disallowed. Another reason to use an OTC avenue instead of a normal exchange is when the amount involved is so significant that it may affect the markets and price of the crypto asset involved.</div>
<div>Furthermore, over-the-counter is ideal where the instruments traded aren’t listed on a conventional exchange. Therefore, prices and quantities involved in OTC trades aren’t automatically accessible by the public.</div>
<div>Note that over-the-counter trades only involve two parties. However, the traders don’t physically meet. Instead, they use OTC-specific networks to meet and trade. Over-the-counter trading is a key component in the global financial sector since it boosts liquidity and enhances trading flexibility.</div>
<p>Despite its advantages, OTC trading has higher counterparty risks compared to formal exchanges. The trading option may suffer from low liquidity when high trading amounts are involved. Additionally, lack of transparency on prices lead to uneven trading grounds.</p>
<div>Information sharing on OTC networks goes through electronic listing services such as the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB). Examples of OTC networks dealing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies include Coinbase Prime, Kraken OTC Desk, BitBay OTC and Bitpanda Plus.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading?</h2>
<p>To understand over-the-counter (OTC) trading, you'll first need to understand what over-the-counter actually means. Over-the-counter refers to the process of how securities are traded through a broker-dealer network as opposed to a centralized exchange. Over-the-counter trading involves equities, debt instruments as well as derivatives that are financial contracts an can derive their value from an underlying asset, an example being a commodity.</p>
<p>There are specific cases as well where the securities might not meet the requirements to have a listing on standard market exchange and these can be traded over-the-counter.</p>
<p>Now, in trading terms, over-the-counter trading is the process of trading through a decentralized dealer network. A decentralized market is a market that is structured to consist of various technical devices, and this structure is what allows investors to create a marketplace without a central location. As such, the opposite of OTC trading is exchange trading, and this takes place through a centralized exchange.</p>
<p>An example of over-the-counter trading would be smaller securities, as they consists of stocks that do not need to meet market capitalization requirements. Over-the-counter markets can also involve companies that cannot keep their stock above a certain price per share or ones that are in bankruptcy filings. These types of companies are not able to trade on an exchange, but can trade on over-the-counter markets. </p>
<p>Over-the-counter trades have risks associated with them: investors can experience additional risk when trading over-the-counter. Furthermore, OTC prices are not disclosed publicly until after the trade is complete, and as such, a trade can be executed between two parties through an OTC market without others being aware of the price at the point of the transaction.</p>

<title>Overbought</title>

<file>overbought.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>When a cryptocurrency has been purchased by more and more investors over time, with its price increasing for an extended period of time.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Overbought?</h2>
<div>Overbought is a term used to describe a phenomenon where a cryptocurrency price increases over time due to continued investments, but without a supporting investment rationale. Usually, a selling period follows an overbought condition. In other words, a crypto asset enters the overbought region when it is believed to be trading above its fair value.</div>
<div>The occurrence can be long or short-lived, and the price may tank if the phenomenon reverses. In the digital currency ecosystem, technical analysis is one of the tools used to determine if an asset is overbought and when the trend is likely to make a U-turn.</div>
<div>Fundamental analysis, which involves evaluating publicly available information tied to industry and macro-economic factors, can also be used to unearth an overbought condition. In addition, fundamental analysis helps forecast when a cryptocurrency will abandon its unsupported upward price increase.</div>
<div>Measuring overbought levels through technical tools involves factors such as traded volume, recent price and trading momentum. Examples of technical formulas used to indicate an overbought level include the relative strength index (RSI), stochastic and Williams %R. RSI factors in the trading speed and the price fluctuation; it records the levels with values between 0 and 100, with anything above 70 indicating an overbought signal.</div>
<div>The stochastic, on the other hand, shows an overbought level by comparing the current asset price with its highest and lowest price over a given period. On a scale of 0 to 100, a rating of 80 shows it is overvalued.</div>
<p>Williams %R evaluates how the current price compares with the highest price over a given period called lookback. A value of 20-0 indicates an overbought level. In 2020, for instance, the RSI showed that Bitcoin reached overbought levels in February when it clocked the $10,000 mark.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>When a cryptocurrency has been sold by more and more investors over time, with its price decreasing for an extended period of time.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Oversold?</h2>
<div>Oversold is a term used to indicate that an asset such as Bitcoin is trading at a price lower than its true value. Oversold is the opposite of overbought. Therefore, whether an asset is treading the oversold region is subjective since analysts employ different analysis tools.</div>
<div>An oversold occurrence has no known reversal period. However, technical indicators measure a cryptocurrency asset's oversold status. Moreover, the indicators provide estimates of when the condition is likely to reverse. In most cases, the reversal date is based on “if” conditions. For example, analysts may observe that a shift will only happen if a certain price level, often called a support level, is reached.</div>
<div>Common technical indicators used to indicate an oversold condition include relative strength index (RSI) and Bollinger bands. The RSI indicator uses a momentum oscillator to evaluate the speed and price fluctuation. On the other hand, Bollinger bands consist of a lower, middle, and upper band.</div>
<div>The middle band taps into an asset’s moving average while the lower and upper bands record standard price deviations in respect to the middle band. An oversold condition occurs when the values shift towards the upper band. Apart from technical indicators, an oversold condition can also be revealed using fundamental analysis. Fundamental indicators rely on current and past prices.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Pair?</h2>
<div>A pair is a combination of two cryptocurrencies to facilitate trading on a digital currency exchange. Commonly referred to as a trading pair, it shows which cryptocurrencies can be exchanged during a trade. A dash (—) or a slash (/) represents a pair by separating the two coins. For example, BTC/ETH indicates a Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pair. Interacting with this pair allows a trader to buy BTC with ETH or sell Bitcoin to get ETH.</div>
<div>Apart from crypto-to-crypto pairs, exchanges supporting fiat currencies can have fiat/crypto pairs. However, the trading basics are the same. In a pair, the first currency is known as the base currency, while the second makes the quote currency.</div>
<div>For instance, in our above example, BTC is the base while ETH is the quote currency. On an exchange, a pair spells out how much of the quote currency is needed to purchase a full unit of the base crypto. On most cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether (USDT) form the base currencies in most trading pairs.</div>
<div>Choosing a trading pair is influenced by many factors. Key among them include whether the preferred exchange has listed the pair and whether the pair has enough liquidity. Note that choosing a trading pair with low liquidity or trading volume means that it may take time to fill the order or the order might not even be filled at all.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Paper Trading?</h2>
<div>Paper trading or simulated trading is the practice of using a virtual transactional environment to simulate trading without the use of real capital. Paper trading can be practiced in several ways through various applications and software, or traditionally by paper-based bookkeeping methods. </div>
<h2>Why Is Paper Trading Used?</h2>
<div>Primarily, paper trading is used to evaluate real-life trading processes, expectations, and outcomes without incurring any risk. Moreover, as the trading scenarios are purely hypothetical, they can be applied to any financial instrument, be it indices, forex, stocks, bonds, futures, margin products, or even cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>Novice traders can begin to invest a certain amount of virtual assets and leverage them onto the data provided by the market. This way, they can generate accurate results, test multiple trading strategies, gauge their sentiments, and practice risk management before risking any actual money down.</p>
<h2>Possible Drawbacks</h2>
<div>The only potential downside for paper trading is unlimited trade capital which can lead to bad trading habits. The other obstacle faced in paper trading is the absence of real outcome-based emotions. Loss is met with relief of evading real penalties and gains bring out FOMO (Fear of missing out). </div>
<p>However, these problems can be mitigated by limiting the virtual trade balance and maintaining a broader view of trading outcomes. </p>
<p>Keeping virtual trading scenarios as close to real-world trading is known to achieve the most beneficial results. </p>
<h2>What Are the Best Paper Trading Platforms and Apps?</h2>
<p>Paper trading can be practiced in a number of ways depending on the ease of accessibility and replicability of results. It can be done on something as simple as a piece of paper or a complex trading simulation. </p>
<p>These days, modern trading platforms are preferred for their simplicity and accuracy of the market simulation. Functionally, many of these platforms tend to be similar in a manner that they allow users to choose desired time to place a fake buy or sell order. Then, based on the information of the performance of the financial instrument, gain or loss-based outcomes are presented, similar to actual trade. </p>
<p>Some of the most commonly used paper trading platforms can be found below:</p>
<p>Heralded by industry professionals and trading novices alike, Think or Swim by TD Ameritrade provides a platform for paper trading. It is available to use via a website or the official app. TD Ameritrade offers the basic version of the platform for free. However, a funded account can give access to additional features. </p>
<p>Functionality and a user-friendly interface make Think or Swim a popular choice in the trading community. Aside from standard paper trading, Think or Swim contains perks like historical trades. It allows its users to travel back in time, as far as 2008, and perform simulated trades as those price movements are happening in the present.</p>
<p>TradingView provides an in-depth and detailed look into paper trading with customizable charts, detailed metrics, and functional projections. While the interface can be overwhelming for rookies, its charting options make it a go-to platform for day traders.</p>
<p>TradingView is particularly desirable for its options day trading, offering stocks, forex, and cryptocurrency pairs.</p>
<p>Easily one of the most popular platforms, Jstock takes a more relaxed approach to its design. By keeping a minimalistic interface and a legible overview, Jstock provides simplicity and ease for beginners. However, while lacking in certain areas, this is a solid option and is worth considering for its user-friendliness and operability. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Paper Wallet?</h2>
<div>A paper wallet is a physical storage system that holds cryptocurrency private keys. Since cryptocurrencies are virtual assets, a wallet doesn’t store them in the paper wallet, per se. Instead, a paper wallet provides a mechanism to safely store unique keys to your virtual wealth. Keys are written or printed on a piece of paper; hence the term paper wallet.</div>
<div>The keys can be stored in their alphanumeric raw form, or they can be printed as a QR code. Note that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have public and private keys. A public key, for example, works like a public email address and can be publicly shared to allow others to deposit, but not access, BTC in your account. A private key, on the other hand, works like a sensitive password and gives its holder the ability to access and transfer the coins.</div>
<p>Although they’re very secure when kept in safe hiding, paper wallets have dropped in popularity due to advances in cryptocurrency storage technology. Setting up a paper wallet involves the use of a reputable paper wallet generator. However, avoid generating a paper wallet from any electronic source as far as possible. This is because by generating a paper wallet, even if it’s just a printing file, you may leave a digital footprint for hackers to exploit. </p>
<div>Instead, the safest way to create a paper wallet is to simply write down your recovery seed phrase or private key from your screen or device, double check it, and then hide it somewhere secure. This applies to both software and hardware wallets. </div>
<div>Wallet generators provide random but unique public and private keys. Despite their shared offline features, like cold storage devices that operate offline, paper wallets present multiple risks.</div>
<p>For example, the paper may be misplaced or damaged. The quality of the paper and ink used by the printer may negatively impact the readability of the keys, especially when stored for long periods. The paper wallet can also be damaged by the elements, like water, fire or moisture in the air. Additionally, problems may arise if the wallet-generating software gets an update and fails to recognize the old paper wallet’s format.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are also “steel wallets” (made of strong rust-resistant metals like aluminium and titanium) available that are fire-resistant and should last a very long time.</p>

<preview>Parachains are application-specific data structures that run in parallel to each other within Polkadot.</preview>
<description>
<div>Parachains refer to application-based, individual blockchains (although there is no specific need for them to take the form of blockchains) that run in parallel with each other within the whole Polkadot network. Parachains are connected to Polkadot in a “hub and spoke” style architecture, allowing developers to create new and independently functioning networks powered with the same framework as the main chain.</div>
<div>The technology behind parachains is supported by Substrate, a new-generation framework for building blockchains with web3 functionality, which is also utilized to build and develop Polkadot and Kusama. </div>
<div>Each parachain is connected with the main chain through the central Relay Chain, which allows them to function independently without compromising their connection with the entire network. You can treat a parachain just like a regular blockchain since it can have its own functionality, token, governance system and other attributes. However, each parachain can still enjoy the security provided by the Polkadot network and be backed by its validator model since it is linked by said Relay Chain. In other words, one is not required to build his own validator community in order to maintain a parachain.</div>
<p>There are also “collator” nodes that assist validators in securing parachains. As opposed to validators, collator nodes do not secure the network. Collator nodes keep a record of every parachain data, select new block candidates and confirm the inputs and status of a parachain along with validators. Moreover, cross-chain message passing (XCMP) enables parachains to interact with the main chains. </p>
<p>Since the economics of a parachain can be different from the entire Polkadot ecosystem, they can set different transaction fees according to the choice of their own community.</p>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Participation nodes are present in the Algorand platform to help in conducting the Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) consensus process.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Participation Node?</h2>
<div>The definition of nodes changes from application to application depending on the purpose provided. In the context of a blockchain network, nodes are electrical devices that are linked to the network and have an IP address. In general, nodes serve as communication endpoints, which implies that any user or program wishing to connect with the blockchain must do so via nodes. As a result, nodes serve as a point of communication redistribution.</div>
<div>Because there is no central authority controlling who has access to a decentralized ledger: anybody may run a node. Most public blockchains strive to be dynamic and decentralized, with people coming and departing and nodes going down and up on a regular basis. Furthermore, certain blockchains may allow nodes to run while not participating in consensus. This happens in some Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) blockchains, where stakeholders vote on who gets to be a validator and create a block. However, not everyone has the time, knowledge, or competence to manage a node.</div>
<div>There are two kinds of nodes in Algorand: relay nodes and participation nodes. In Algorand, relay nodes act as network hubs, transmitting protocol messages between participating nodes in a timely and efficient manner. Participation nodes, one of the most powerful nodes in Algorand, help Alog’s consensus process by introducing and validating new blocks. Participation keys are used to sign consensus protocol communications and are stored on participation nodes.</div>
<div>Participation nodes use the Algorand consensus mechanism to connect with one another via relay nodes. To become a participation node, each network participant must stake ALGO and generate a valid participation key. Algorand's PPoS consensus method employs a two-phase block creation procedure that includes proposing and voting. Participation nodes are coordinated by relay nodes, which allow communication across them but do not directly engage in proposing and voting processes.</div>
<div>The participation nodes, who are authorized by the user's participation key, propose and vote on blocks on behalf of the user's stake inside the consensus process. If the relevant participation keys are placed in a single participation node, it can represent numerous users. Anyone is welcome to run it. It assures the Algorand blockchain's security, as long as enough of them operate the consensus process honestly, the blockchain will never split, even if all relay nodes are corrupted.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Passive Income?</h2>
<p>Passive income is money produced from investments that do not require the earner to be actively involved. The aim of a passive income is to generate a steady income stream without the requirements expected from a full-time job. A passive income can encompass many investments; however, it’s traditionally often seen in dividend stocks, peer-to-peer lending, rental properties and royalties, to name a few industries. Through these methods, investors can increase their earnings and boost their financial goals.</p>
<div>With the growth of the crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) industries, it’s opening up doors for investors keen to earn a passive income in different ways. For newcomers and veterans of the space, DeFi is providing an opportunity for crypto investors to earn annual percentage yields (APYs) that puts most bank savings to shame. Since DeFi kicked off in the summer of 2020, aided by the sale of Compound’s COMP token, there have been a number of ways for investors to generate passive income.</div>
<p>Some popular methods in DeFi for earning passive income include lending, staking, and yield farming, all which use your crypto to generate passive income. </p>
<div>Lending platforms are a straightforward concept. Users lend their idle crypto assets to a platform, which are locked into a smart contract. In return, the lending platforms pay the crypto holders an APY. The locked assets are accessed by borrowers as loans, with interest paid back to the platform. With the aid of smart contracts governing the entire process, there is no risk to the crypto lender with the borrower defaulting on their loan. This means that those who wish to withdraw their crypto assets can do so at any time.</div>
<div>Staking, which originates from networks that run proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms, is the process that involves a crypto holder locking, or staking, their assets in a smart contract. By keeping a user’s assets locked up for the long-term, they are able to earn more of the same token in return. For instance, if it’s on the Ethereum blockchain, it’ll be its native Ether token. Staking is a way for users to earn extra through incentives as they contribute to the network’s security and decentralization. By sharing the network revenue, network validators can ensure that the PoS blockchains are abiding by the rules and that the system isn’t being cheated.</div>
<div>Another popular method in DeFi for earning a passive income is through yield farming. Yield farming, which is also referred to as liquidity mining, allows crypto holders to generate extra rewards while providing liquidity to pools. Liquidity providers (LPs) receive an LP token denoting their pool share for supplying liquidity to a pool. The rewards generated for being a LP usually includes trading fees when trades happen in the pool. LP tokens can then be staked onto a protocol or project to earn additional rewards. These rewards are usually in the form of the project’s/protocol’s native token. These tokens can then be staked for even more rewards, making yield farming quite profitable and a good source of passive income. Yield farming is generally seen as riskier compared to staking/lending, but also rewards the farmer with higher APYs.</div>

<h2>What Is a Password Manager?</h2>
<p>With so many passwords to remember, plenty of savvy internet users have entrusted a password manager to secure and manage their passwords. A password manager is a time-saving tool that encrypts and stores a user’s passwords so that they can access their accounts when needed. Typically, a web browser may have a password manager already installed, but there are also password manager software programs that can be downloaded separately. </p>
<div>The downside to password managers is that they can make one vulnerable to losing access to all of their accounts, so many password managers will require 2FA for additional safety. Unfortunately, if someone hacks or phishes the master key (the password to the password manager), the hacker can have access to all of a user’s login information.</div>

<description>
<div>Paul Le Roux is a mysterious figure that some think could be the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Le Roux is a cryptographer, international crime kingpin and former informant for the DEA. Le Roux was born in Zimbabwe in 1972 to unknown parents and was adopted by a young couple who later moved to South Africa. As a teen, he became extremely interested in the new technology of computers and quickly learned to program and found work as a programmer in the UK, U.S. and Australia.</div>
<p>Paul Le Roux invented an encryption software known as E4M (Encryption for the Masses), which was designed to give the public more privacy when it came to disk storage. He believed strongly in privacy from the prying eyes of governments around the world. After a divorce, he relocated several times to Hong Kong and then the Netherlands all the while taking on encryption projects for various companies.</p>
<p>Le Roux went on to launch a series of websites dedicated to online prescription filling where customers could get access to prescription drugs under dubious circumstances. His company, RX Limited, became extremely profitable, and he went on to make possibly millions in sales through the websites. He quickly moved on to establish businesses in a number of industries, from land leasing in Zimbabwe to logging operations in the Congo. He relocated to Manila, Philippines, where he oversaw his businesses which had expanded to a slew of illegal activity including arms dealing, drug and gold smuggling, and money laundering through a series of shell companies he founded.</p>
<p>He became something of a cartel leader with a growing amount of hired muscle and guns, all the while running operations through his Manila compound. At some point in his operations, he was approached by the DEA and became an informant of global crime. However, this would not save him from ongoing investigation and eventual prosecution. After a cocaine and methamphetamine deal involving a Colombian cartel (consisting of undercover DEA) in Liberia, Le Roux was arrested by Liberian police and DEA operatives. In 2020 Le Roux received a 25-year prison sentence in the U.S. for his crimes surrounding RX Limited and his global crime operations.</p>
<p>With a rap sheet fit for a Bond villain, Paul Le Roux’s actions were shrouded in secrecy. Although he had become a murderer and global crime kingpin, many surmise that his brilliance in coding and encryption land him as a prime suspect as Bitcoin’s creator. We may never know who the real Satoshi Nakamoto is, but Paul Le Roux will remain high for some on the list of potential identities.  </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Payee?</h2>
<p>A payee is a party within an exchange of goods or even services that can receive payment. The payee is paid by cash, check or another form of transfer medium by a payer.</p>
<p>The payer receives the goods or services in return for making the payment.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that payees can be more than just one party in a transaction, and at times, they are the same party.</p>
<p>To truly get a grasp of this, in any type of transaction, there will always be a party that involves the goods or services, and the party that receives the goods or services. To receive goods or services, a buyer has to provide value, or in other words, an exchange of value, that is often money to the payee. This can also be a cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Now, in a banking situation, the payee must have an active account that is in good standing, through which the funds can be transmitted by the payer themselves. This is if the transaction is not done in cash, however.</p>
<p>Then you have the promissory note, where one party promises to pay another party a predetermined sum, where the party which receives the payment is known as the payee. The party which makes the payment is known to the buyers as-well. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that payees can also be more than one party, and this typically happens in electronic transfers when a person withdrawals money from a payer's account and ends up splitting it into a variety of different payee allocations.</p>

<preview>The decentralized interactions between parties in a distributed network, partitioning tasks or workloads between peers.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Peer-to-Peer (P2P)?</h2>
<div>Peer-to-peer (P2P) refers to a distributed network where “computer systems” communicate with each other to share data or tasks. This means that two or more parties arranging and agreeing to deal with each other are sufficient for the whole process to occur. Furthermore, a central server isn’t required to facilitate and manage such communication. </div>
<div>All peers are considered equal and enjoy the same privileges. The only requirement to access a P2P system is an internet connection and a copy of the software (or protocol) used. Peers or nodes generally make all or some parts of their resources available to the network in the absence of a central server processing request and managing resources/tasks. </div>
<div>P2P has special significance in the context of cryptocurrencies and blockchain. For instance, Bitcoin’s whitepaper defines its protocol as “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” — a reference to the mutually beneficial and equal involvement of all participants without the need for any intermediaries. All peers or nodes of a blockchain typically have the same copy of records of accounts and transactions history, although miners (and other “full nodes”) who contribute processing power to the network in lieu of block subsidies and transaction fees have a more complete copy of the records. </div>
<div>Bitcoin is a true peer-to-peer protocol which doesn’t rely on any third party with centralized control, but P2P doesn’t always have to be blockchain-based. BitTorrent was originally not blockchain-based (before Tron acquisition), yet it is considered one of the largest decentralized peer-to-peer systems.</div>

<title>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending</title>

<file>peer-to-peer-p2p-lending.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Crypto P2P lending refers to a practice of lending assets without the involvement of a middleman. Such loans rely on collateral material originally owned by borrowers.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending?</h2>
<div>Peer-to-peer lending, also known as P2P lending, crowdlending, or social lending, allows borrowers to connect directly with lenders, bypassing the middleman normally involved in traditional banking systems. In a P2P lending scenario, lenders are typically referred to as “investors,” who loan money to qualified applicants. An intermediary website (P2P platform) usually sets the rates and the term for the lending agreement, and once the terms are agreed by both parties, the transaction is facilitated.</div>
<p>To better understand P2P lending, it is important to have a firm grasp of the traditional banking model. Typically, if you want to take out a loan, you must fill out an application and submit it to the bank. The bank will then assess your creditworthiness and any other factors they deem relevant before deciding on whether or not they will grant you the loan and the terms you will be offered. Once terms have been agreed, the bank will then source the capital from either the central bank or the savings deposits of their other banking customers.</p>
<p>There are a few challenges involved with this method:</p>
<h2>Traditional P2P Lending</h2>
<div>Traditional P2P lending occurs when fiat currencies, such as USD, GBP, or YEN, are exchanged by two parties outside the conventional banking system. In these instances, peer-to-peer lending websites, such as Prosper, Lending Club, and Peerform, offer multiple loans and have competitive interest rates and low fees. These P2P platforms usually highlight their borrower qualifications upfront to save time during the application process.</div>
<h2>Cryptocurrency P2P Lending</h2>
<div>In recent years, the P2P lending market has continued to evolve with the introduction of cryptocurrency, in particular, the Ethereum blockchain. Now, P2P lenders can utilize decentralized networks and smart contracts to open up new possibilities for accessing financial services outside of traditional banking infrastructure. This is what is commonly referred to as DeFi (decentralized finance).</div>
<div>Thanks to blockchain technology, borrowers and lenders may engage in a loan arrangement without the necessity for a middleman. With the use of this tech, smart contracts are automatically executed as per the loan terms, which enables trustless transactions between both parties. </div>
<div>Just like traditional P2P loans, loans that occur on the blockchain still require collateral, usually deposited in either fiat or digital currencies. In most cases, the collateral is held on an intermediary website or crypto P2P platform, where it will be held in a smart contract in accordance with the terms stipulated in the agreement.</div>
<div>The maximum quantity an individual can borrow is decided by the value of the collateral given. This is typically known as the collateral factor or collateral ratio. This system is implemented due to the fact that there is no creditworthiness evaluation or past history to consider because the lender generally does not reveal their identity. On the other side of the transaction, lenders earn interest from borrowers, which is usually set at a pre-agreed rate. In some cases, crypto P2P platforms offer incentives and other bonuses to lenders in order to attract more volume to their platform so that their lending ecosystem can function adequately. </div>
<p>Some of the most popular crypto-based P2P lending projects include:</p>
<p>These decentralized platforms make lending available to anyone with access to the internet and sufficient funds to put down as collateral. These services are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week, and operate much more efficiently than traditional banking services. It is one of the reasons for the massive surge in popularity over the past couple of years. </p>
<div>Furthermore, there is no need for any KYC process, which means that lenders and borrowers can interact anonymously, which would have been thought impossible in the not-so-distant past. </div>
<div>With that said, one of the main criticisms of crypto P2P lending is the steep learning curve associated with the process, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the fundamentals of cryptocurrency transactions. The UX of most major platforms is relatively clunky, and there is still an element of uncertainty towards the safety and security of these platforms. Unfortunately, many of the major lending platforms have experienced hacks and exploits in some respect, which has caused both lenders and borrowers to lose funds and suffer financial losses. </div>
<p>As the industry continues to grow and find new ways to iron out these kinks, it’s likely that crypto P2P lending platforms will begin to play a larger role in our collective financial future, which should pave the way for a more simple, accessible, and cost-effective form of lending. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Peg?</h2>
<p>A “peg” is a specified price for the rate of exchange between two assets. This is in direct contrast to “floating” currencies which have no hard price target and follow looser monetary policy.</p>
<p>In the usual global context of currencies, a peg allows foreign currencies to be traded for the chosen base currency at a fixed exchange rate. Some of the most common benefits of establishing a peg are to encourage trade between nations, to reduce the risks associated with expanding into broader markets and to stabilize macro-economic activity.</p>
<div>In the context of cryptocurrency, a peg refers to the specific price that a token is aiming to stay at. The majority-case use of a peg is for stablecoins; stablecoins are cryptocurrency assets that maintain their value over a long period of time. Notable examples include USDT, DAI and FRAX, all of which are pegged to $1. The dollar itself is “soft-pegged” to the consumer price index (CPI) which tracks a basket of goods.</div>
<div>Stablecoins maintain their peg through contraction or dilution of the total supply. The changes in the token supply will change the relative price of each token, until it reaches the desired peg. Collateralized stablecoins such as USDT and DAI are minted and burned as appropriate, with the newly minted tokens receiving collateral backing in the form of other digital assets. </div>
<div>Algorithmic stablecoins maintain their peg through a combination of collateralization and utilising complex smart contract algorithms that contract and expand the supply based on various market factors.   </div>
<div>Author: Sam Kazemian, CEO of Frax </div>
<div>Sam Kazemian is the founder of FRAX, a fractional algorithmic stablecoin that is partially backed by collateral and stabilized algorithmically, and the only fractional stablecoin that has maintained its peg since its conception. FRAX is open-source and permissionless, bringing a truly trustless, scalable and stable asset to the future of decentralized finance.</div>
<p>Kazemian brings a wealth of experience as a leading blockchain entrepreneur and crypto enthusiast, as the co-founder of the blockchain based knowledge base, Everipedia. Kazemian’s crypto journey started at UCLA in 2013 where he began mining crypto in his college dorm room and today is a frequent guest lecturer at UCLA covering crypto, computer science and entrepreneurship.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Pegged Currency?</h2>
<p>A pegged currency or currency pegging is the process of a country attaching, or pegging its exchange rate to another currency, or basket of currencies or another measure of value. As such, pegging is sometimes referred to as a fixed exchange rate. A currency peg is something used in order to provide stability to a currency by attaching its value, which is at a predetermined ratio, to add different and more stable currency. </p>
<p>Pegged currency provides benefits, as it is a fundamental basis for a government that is planning to promote credibility as well as discipline in monetary policies, and this is especially the case of impoverished as well as unstable economies.</p>
<p>Businesses can gain a competitive advantage in the International markets against rivals that face forex risk. Countries that do not adopt currency pegs however are susceptible to foreign influence, and this leads to trade imbalances where it might be difficult to attain an automatic exchange rate adjustment. A minor deviation from the peg could lead to heavy speculative attacks as well.</p>
<p>When we discuss pegged currency in the world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are the most recent version of pegging in the crypto world. A stablecoin is a currency whose value is pegged to a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency. There are many projects out there that involve stablecoins., and they perform an important function in an industry that is known for its high volatility when it comes to prices. Stablecoins offer the utility to easily convert crypto coins into FIAT currencies. Stablecoins can also solve liquidity issues on crypto exchanges, and the technology can even create paths for more financial services, such as loans and insurance to be implemented within the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A ledger designed with restrictions, such that only people or organizations requiring access have permission to access it.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Permissioned Ledger?</h2>
<div>A permissioned ledger is a closed-source distributed ledger technology (DLT) variant where the participants are known and authorization is required before usage or activity validation on the network. This property differentiates them from public networks such as the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, which are open to all and don’t require any prior authorization. Permissioned ledgers are more suitable for organizations or consortiums, which have the requirement of privileged private information, far away from public domain. </div>
<div>A permissioned ledger is distinguished from a centralized database in the sense its participants are diverse and it has no single point of failure. Unlike in centralized databases, all data is verifiable using secure cryptography and digitally-verifiable signatures. Permissioned ledgers can be based on other public networks, but are notably different in design and execution.</div>
<div>However, such ledgers are tokenless and offer high performance. Furthermore, they allow business entities and corporations to share sensitive information with security, cost-effectiveness and confidentiality. Permissioned and public ledgers share a similarity in terms of immutability, although the latter is generally a lot more robust in this aspect. </div>
<div>The governance mechanism of permissioned ledgers is semi-centralized, but requires the agreement of all the authorized parties involved. These systems also vary in degrees of decentralization, transparency, anonymity, security and censorship-resistance. They also enjoy advantages in legal and regulatory matters over their permissionless counterparts. Typical examples of permissioned ledgers are R3, B3i and Hyperledger.</div>

<file>permissionless.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Often used to describe blockchains, a system is said to be permissionless when there is no entity that can regulate who can use it and how it can be used.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Permissionless?</h2>
<p>A system is said to be permissionless when it has no so-called “gatekeepers.” In the case of blockchains, we can say that Bitcoin is permissionless since no entity can forbid anybody else from using it or limiting its use for any purpose.</p>
<p>Put simply, Bitcoin is permissionless because anybody can use it in any way they want as long as the protocol itself allows for it, without anybody being able to stop them.</p>
<p>The permissionless nature of cryptocurrency is often highlighted by Bitcoin proponents as one of its foremost features. Thanks to it being permissionless, Bitcoin and its blockchain can be used by political dissidents or other organizations blacklisted by the banking systems, such as Wikileaks or even criminals. No state can censor transactions on a permissionless blockchain.</p>
<p>Permissioned systems, on the other hand, have some entity which limits who and/or how the system can be used. The traditional financial system is permissioned, since banks and states limit who and for what purposes people can use banks and other financial entities.</p>
<p>Much like the traditional financial system, some blockchains are also permissioned in nature and cannot be used by anyone and for any reason. Usually such blockchains are used by enterprises for a single purpose and can only be used by market participants, as only whitelisted addresses can use the chain.</p>
<p>The term “permissionless” refers to the property of a protocol being accessible to everyone without restriction, and thus, not requiring any prior permission. </p>
<div>It is broadly embedded in the decentralized spirit and open-source ethos of the crypto and blockchain community that no central party should have the option to allow or disallow anyone from using a permissionless platform. Therefore, anyone who wants to access a blockchain generally does not usually need to provide identification or other KYC requirements. </div>
<p>Permissionless or public blockchains ensure that nobody is discriminated against or censored on any basis, and that everyone has equal opportunity to participate whoever or wherever they may be. </p>
<div>Generally, the consensus mechanisms used in permissionless networks are proof-of-work (POW) or proof of-stake (POS). With these mechanisms, it is paramount for the system’s long-term viability that its network participants (miners and stakers) should be incentivized to be honest and act in favor of normal operation. Typical examples of permissionless networks are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero.</div>
<div>This is in contrast to permissioned networks like Facebook’s Diem or enterprise blockchains, where a central party can restrict or censor either a network’s users or certain types of activities/transactions. They also require the identification of users to be declared and entered into their records. Most permissioned networks are cryptographically secured by a few validators who are authorized to produce blocks and/or contribute to the network.</div>

<file>perpetual-contracts.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A perpetual contract is a derivative similar to a futures contract but without an expiry date.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Perpetual Contracts?</h2>
<div>Perpetual contracts are a type of derivative that lets you easily speculate on the price of an asset. Similar to futures, you use tokens as collateral to open a leveraged position. If you speculate that the price of that asset will go up and it indeed goes up, when you close your position you will receive more tokens than you put in. Vice versa, if the price goes in the opposite direction, upon closing your position you will receive less than the amount you put into this position. </div>
<div>The major difference between futures and perpetual contracts is the expiration. Futures contracts are settled after a pre-set period, whereas perpetual contracts have no expiration or settlement date, meaning you can hold a contract for an indefinite amount of time.</div>
<div>For traditional futures contracts, the contract’s price gradually converges with the underlying asset’s spot market price as the expiry date approaches. Since they do not have an expiry date, perpetual contracts have a premium called a funding payment that is paid between traders to help keep the price in line with the spot market. If the contract price is above the spot price, traders holding long positions will pay traders holding short positions, and vice versa. These payments occur at regular intervals (typically 1 hour or 8 hours). </div>
<p>Due to their ease of use and flexibility, perpetual contracts are the most traded instrument in the cryptocurrency space, with trillions of dollars in trading volume each day.</p>

<h2>What Is Phone Phishing?</h2>
<div>Phone phishing, also known as a telephone scam or vishing (voice phishing), refers to the practice of using fraudulent and malicious phone calls to extort money or sensitive information from victims. Phone phishing involves attackers impersonating trusted institutions or parties for personal gains.</div>
<p>Attackers would often call unsuspecting victims, offering them extended warranty on products, services, antivirus software, charity donations, or even free vacations. They then proceed to ask for victims’ credit card numbers and other financial information.</p>
<p>Hackers may rely on fear tactics and threats to force people into giving them money. They commonly prey on the most vulnerable types of people such as immigrants, threatening them with arrests, fines, or even deportation if they do not pay taxes or a solicited amount of money. Phone phishing scams may also involve ultimatums or urgent warning messages to intimidate victims into responding spontaneously. </p>
<div>In 2018, phone phishing schemes have accounted for more than $48 million in losses in the US alone. Unfortunately, the practice is still on the rise even today, which is why people must get informed on common phishing tactics to prevent falling prey to future attacks.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A physical Bitcoin is a physical token that usually has an intricate design, as well as a public key and private key.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Physical Bitcoins?</h2>
<div>The idea of creating various physical forms of Bitcoin (BTC) has been around ever since the cryptocurrency’s creation. Whilst Bitcoin is thoroughly a product of the digital age, there has nonetheless been interest in practices such as printing out private keys and safeguarding them in the form of physical items, or finding ways to make digital assets feel more like traditional fiat currencies through a physical token. Having something physical in hand appeals to many people and this approach has driven an entire subset of the crypto community to develop the concept of physical Bitcoin. Many are also interested in the item’s potential as a collectible object.</div>
<p>There are many different ways to transform a virtual currency into a physical object: most frequently, by making a coin that replicates the familiar experience of cash.</p>
<p>A physical Bitcoin essentially has three aspects. The creation of a physical coin, which, however, in itself implies no virtual value. Then there is the appealing design of the front side of the coin — yet again, this is done only for cosmetic reasons. The design can be a simple logo or a more elaborate design concept. The third and final aspect is the posterior side of the coin. Coins that have a blank side are known as blanks. In this case, this means that the coin is not loaded with any Bitcoin or Bitcoin addresses.</p>
<div>You might well be asking yourself, how can this physical item potentially be transformed into Bitcoin? Two further components are needed for this, similar to the principle behind paper wallets. The first is the provision of a public key, which is hidden from plain sight. It should, however, still be accessible to the holder when needed. The holder can read the public key on the backside, in different ways, depending on how the physical Bitcoin is designed and configured. This allows him or her to spend the Bitcoin that is stored on the physical coin. </div>
<div>The second component is the safekeeping of a private key, which is typically done using a tamper-proof hologram in order to ensure maximum security.</div>

<preview>Play-to-earn blockchain games are one of the biggest new ways to make money just by playing a game.</preview>
<description>
<div>Play2Earn (play-to-earn) games refer to the concept of gaming in which a platform provides its players with a chance to earn any form of in-game assets that can be transferred to the real world as a valuable resource. </div>
<p></p>
<p>As technology has become more accessible to the general public, video game business models have developed to a whole new level. Previously, games could only be played on arcade machines in specific gaming arenas. Gamers would battle for the highest score with a sack full of quarters. However, things changed drastically as the revolution in technology brought games to our smartphones, home computers, and gaming consoles such as PS5, Xbox, and so on. </p>
<p></p>
<div>Now, the world is seeing a new gaming model known as play2earn, specifically in the blockchain universe. It effectively gives players a chance to generate revenues by participating in games. Players create value for other gamers and developers by engaging in the in-game ecosystem and earn assets for their contributions. These digital assets might range from coins to accessories that have been tokenized on the blockchain. As a result, the play-to-earn business model pairs nicely with blockchain games.</div>
<p></p>
<div>A great example of play2earn games is  Axie Infinity. In this game, Axies are adorable animals that players acquire, breed, and battle to win rewards. Each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT), meaning it is a one-of-a-kind digital collectible. Within the game, there is a whole economy (a world called Lunacia). </div>
<p></p>
<div>In Lunacia, users can acquire land and breed Axies using their in-game tokens, Smooth Love Potion (SLP) and Axie Infinity Shard (AXS). These tokens have utility in real life as well. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Play-to-earn games, like Axie Infinity (AXS), are already helping people around the world (especially countries hit hard by the current pandemic) earn a handsome amount of money. According to an estimate, people in the Philippines are earning $1,500-$2,000 a month just by playing Axie Infinity as a hobby. Many people in Vietnam have also quit their full-time jobs as they are earning a handsome sum of money from these games. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Other NFT games include Lost Relics, Splinterlands, CryptoBlades, DogemonGo, and Sorare.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The NFT market has already surpassed $2.5 billion in sales in 2021 and this number is set to grow exponentially as new NFT games flood the market. The boom in NFT is giving birth to a new generation of revenue streams inside the blockchain world and it might not be long before it surpasses every other major industry.</div>

Previously, games could only be played on arcade machines in specific gaming arenas. Gamers would battle for the highest score with a sack full of quarters. However, things changed drastically as the revolution in technology brought games to our smartphones, home computers, and gaming consoles such as PS5, Xbox, and so on. </p>
<div>Now, the world is seeing a new gaming model known as play2earn, specifically in the blockchain universe. It effectively gives players a chance to generate revenues by participating in games. Players create value for other gamers and developers by engaging in the in-game ecosystem and earn assets for their contributions. These digital assets might range from coins to accessories that have been tokenized on the blockchain. As a result, the play-to-earn business model pairs nicely with blockchain games.</div>
<div>A great example of play2earn games is  Axie Infinity. In this game, Axies are adorable animals that players acquire, breed, and battle to win rewards. Each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT), meaning it is a one-of-a-kind digital collectible. Within the game, there is a whole economy (a world called Lunacia). </div>
<div>In Lunacia, users can acquire land and breed Axies using their in-game tokens, Smooth Love Potion (SLP) and Axie Infinity Shard (AXS). These tokens have utility in real life as well. </div>
<div>Play-to-earn games, like Axie Infinity (AXS), are already helping people around the world (especially countries hit hard by the current pandemic) earn a handsome amount of money. According to an estimate, people in the Philippines are earning $1,500-$2,000 a month just by playing Axie Infinity as a hobby. Many people in Vietnam have also quit their full-time jobs as they are earning a handsome sum of money from these games. Players in the Philippines can check the live value of SLP right here on CoinMarketCap using our SLP to PHP converter.</div>
<div>Other NFT games include Lost Relics, Splinterlands, CryptoBlades, DogemonGo, and Sorare.</div>
<div>The NFT market has already surpassed $2.5 billion in sales in 2021 and this number is set to grow exponentially as new NFT games flood the market. The boom in NFT is giving birth to a new generation of revenue streams inside the blockchain world and it might not be long before it surpasses every other major industry.</div>

<title>Player Payout</title>

<p>Player payouts is a new way of automatically paying online gaming participants immediately after the tournament ends. The underlying blockchain network and smart contract technology ensure all payments are processed instantaneously with cryptocurrency like ETH, MATIC, DAI, USDC, etc.</p>
<h2>What Are Player Payouts?</h2>
<p>The e-sports industry is one of the fastest-growing industries, exceeding billions of dollars in revenue. Due to its surging demand and growing viewership worldwide, esports tournaments attract huge sponsorships from VC firms, Fortune 500 companies, and major media networks.</p>
<p>However, it’s not uncommon for e-sports tournament organizers to delay payments to players for many weeks or even months. To some extent, it’s understandable, as organizers have to manually distribute payments individually among all the winners. Most organizers use traditional transaction models like wire transfers, ACH Transfer, paper checks, etc. These methods are expensive, dependent on human resources and painfully slow, leading to delayed payments.</p>
<p>Automated player payouts are a possible solution for this and other related problems plaguing the esports community. By using smart contracts and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), tournament organizers can automate the process of distributing winnings and processing them immediately to the winner’s crypto wallet. Not only will this help avoid unnecessary transaction fees that both parties pay to the financial institutions, but it will also motivate more organizers and players to be a part of the Play2Earn gaming revolution.</p>
<p>E-sports tournaments are often massive and complex global events that attract millions of competitors annually. Each tournament has a monetary prize pool that is distributed among a select number of winners. Using smart contracts hosted on a blockchain network, organizers can customize and manage the payouts based on each player’s performance in the tournament. Additionally, smart contracts also add more transparency to a tournament’s structure and payout schedule. </p>
<p>Smart contracts are digital contracts that automatically process transactions based on pre-defined parameters. Let’s consider an example to demonstrate how an Ethereum-based smart contract for an esports tournament works (this same process would go for tournament contracts deployed on the Polygon network or any other smart contract ecosystem). </p>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain uses a system of computers (called nodes) that continually confirm and document all transactions on the network. Tournament organizers begin by pre-configuring the payout distribution by choosing how many players will be paid out and what percentage of the funds in the contract each placing will receive. The tournament smart contract is then deployed onto the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>The prize pool is typically made up of player entry fees and/or sponsor donations which are sent in, and held in escrow as the tournament plays out. To start the player payout process after the tournament completes, the organizers will need a small amount of ETH to initiate the smart contract-powered payments. As the players meet the ranking requirements, the defined transactions are processed by and documented on the underlying blockchain. There is no third party involved; hence tournament winners receive their payments almost instantly and for a nominal fee.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Plutus (Cardano)?</h2>
<div>Plutus is one of the most important components of Cardano that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on Cardano.</div>
<div>Smart contracts are automated contracts that can be used to exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent way while avoiding the services of a middleman.</div>
<p>Plutus is an advanced programming language that allows developers to write smart contracts on Cardano in a functional way. It is based on Haskell, which offers a unique combination of top-notch security and high performance.</p>
<p>Developers will be able to create dApps (decentralized applications) using Plutus and Haskell, then run them on the blockchain securely and efficiently.</p>
<p>Plutus was born out of the desire to have a clear, intuitive and consistent language for writing smart contracts on Cardano. It has been specifically designed to interact with a blockchain. It is based on Haskell, which is a general-purpose functional programming language that has been around for decades and is widely used in industry and academia. It's a statically-typed, purely functional language with a strong type system.</p>
<p>Plutus programs run in two different environments:</p>
<p>The first one is a blockchain node, where your financial contract will run when it will be submitted by someone who wants to use it;</p>
<p>The other one is your desktop computer, where you can write and test your contract locally before submitting it.</p>
<p>A contract has no state other than the value of its bound variables. It can read and write data to the ledger, but cannot store any information locally. The only way to change the outcome of a contract based on changing inputs is through recursion because there are no loops or variables in Haskell.</p>
<p>The value of each bound variable appears in the output of the transaction; in addition, a contract can return a list of events to record in the blockchain's event log.</p>
<p>Contracts aren't allowed to interact with external resources outside of the blockchain, so they're much easier to verify and reason about than traditional smart contracts.</p>
<p>In fact, Haskell has long been used for writing critical financial software like the Barclays trading platform and the Bloomberg terminal. </p>
<p>The reason Haskell is such a good fit for financial programming is that it allows you to build large systems in a principled way from small components. For example, Plutus contracts are written in a subset of Haskell — a subset that is functionally pure and has no side effects. This means you can be certain that if you give your contract the same input data, it will always produce the same output.</p>

<file>politeia-decred.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A decentralized governance platform that allows Decred stakeholders to submit, track and discuss proposals for suggestion and implementation of new ideas.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Politeia (Decred)?</h2>
<div>Politeia is a decentralized platform for Decred’s governance. It allows users to submit, discuss and vote on proposals. Politeia is designed to be flexible and extendable so that it can evolve with the needs of the Decred community. Changes to the Decred project are proposed by submitting a proposal to Politeia. Proposals can be anything from a change to the consensus rules to funding for a development project or marketing campaign. It is up to the Decred stakeholders to decide what happens next via voting. Proposals can be voted on by any user that has staked DCR at the time of the vote.</div>
<p>Politeia is used to help protect the governance system of Decred, and it enables stakeholders to make sound decisions with regard to Decred's future. It allows stakeholders to see proposals when they are submitted, discuss them, and vote on them once they are approved.</p>
<p>Decred is an autonomous digital currency. With a hybrid consensus system, it is built to be a decentralized, sustainable, and self-ruling currency. The blockchain-based project strongly focuses on community input and open governance.</p>
<div>The Decred blockchain is secured using a hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus voting model to ensure that a small group cannot dominate the flow of transactions or make changes to Decred without the input of the community.</div>
<p>Stakeholders made the decision to implement Politeia in 2018. The reason? Stakeholders wanted to move from Bitcoin's informal model of governance to a more formal one, which would allow for more effective decision-making and protection against changes that wouldn't work for everyone.</p>
<p>Politeia is important to Decred because it provides an incentive for people to hold DCR. It also allows stakeholders to contribute meaningfully, ensuring that they'll continue holding onto DCR in order to help shape the future of that currency.</p>
<p>Politeia is based on the concept of decentralized governance.</p>
<div>Decentralized governance is a concept that was originally developed by the blockchain community. It has to do with the fact that blockchain technology creates a network of computers that are spread across the globe and can be accessed from anywhere.</div>
<p>The idea behind decentralized governance is to take control away from central authorities and put it back in the hands of users. This way, no one person or entity can shut down a project at will, putting an end to work on it. It also allows for more diverse ideas to be developed, because anyone could submit a proposal and vote on it. The fact that these proposals can't be censored means they're less likely to be rejected.</p>

<file>portfolio-tracking.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The act of tracking the movement and performance of assets of your financial holdings is termed portfolio tracking.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Portfolio Tracking?</h2>
<p>Portfolio tracking is one of the critical components guiding every successful investor. For investors who wish to accurately (and instantaneously) track how a group of investments is performing over time, portfolio tracking is the corresponding method.</p>
<div>Financial markets represent an ever-changing ecosystem, especially when it comes to new-age investment options like cryptocurrencies, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), and DeFi (decentralized finance). In a world where economic uncertainty is a constant, the aim of every individual investor is to meet their financial goals - goals which may be short-term, medium-term or long-term in nature.</div>
<p>Investing across a diverse range of assets doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll succeed. Tracking your investment’s performance and accordingly making the right investment decisions at the right time is crucial to success. From creating Excel spreadsheets to depending on portfolio tracking software and apps, tracking a portfolio in any form or method offers multiple benefits while at the same time delivering useful insights about overall performance.</p>
<p>Risk and return are the two most important aspects of every financial investment and trade. You might have also heard that the higher the risk, the greater the return. But, in reality, the majority of the investors are always on the lookout for opportunities to minimize risks as much as possible. </p>
<p>But how do you minimize the risk?</p>
<p>It is simple: keeping track of assets that you own, how they are performing, and reallocating under-performing assets in real-time.</p>
<p>And this is where portfolio tracking comes into the picture. With portfolio tracking, investors can keep closer tabs on investments like stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies - all of it from a unified dashboard. Be it via an Excel spreadsheet or a high-level application, portfolio tracking provides a more detailed view of how funds have been allocated, the status of current investments, and a big picture view in terms of profitability and losses.</p>
<p>While it may not seem so important, portfolio tracking plays a vital role in helping investors plan and execute portfolio strategies. Besides the big picture view, this activity offers a real-time view that highlights choices available to ensure that investors can appropriately maximize returns while at the same time minimizing possible risk factors that might negatively impact an investment portfolio.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Portfolio Tracking</h2>
<p>Here are some key reasons why everyone should start tracking their investment portfolios:</p>
<p>Helps to manage asset holdings and portfolio rebalancing</p>
<p>Provides valuable insights from past and present performance, facilitating better strategizing for future investments</p>
<p>Build customizable investment plans to meet varying financial goals</p>
<p>Powers faster tax assessment and management</p>
<p>Insights can be leveraged to reallocate funds for maximum returns</p>
<p>Unlocks more diversification opportunities</p>
<p>Delivers preparation for volatile market conditions</p>

<title>Position Size</title>

<preview>Position size is defined as the number of units of a trading instrument that are bought or sold.</preview>
<description>
<div>Written by Yenwen Feng, co-founder of Perpetual Protocol.</div>
<div>Yenwen Feng is a cryptocurrency and technology professional with vast experience as a CEO and co-founder of several startups. Since 2004, Yenwen founded Decore (Stripe Atlas fMessengeror Crypto Companies), Cinch Network (Decentralized Derivatives), Cubie Messenger (Mobile , 500 Startups B5, 10M downloads), Gamelet, and Willmobile (Top mobile financial service app in Taiwan, acquired by Systex). Since 2019, Yenwen is co-founder of Perpetual Protocol.</div>
<p>Position size is a vital part of a trading strategy, since it is directly related to one’s potential profit or loss. A larger position size will generate a higher profit or loss as compared to a smaller position size for a given price move. Sizing a position also plays an important role in risk management as knowing when to execute larger or smaller trades, and when to increase or reduce the size of a position impacts profitability. </p>
<p>Reducing position size may be a good idea when one is in a profitable position and if there’s an imminent risk of the price moving against you. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to increase size when the risk to your position is very low and you want to capitalize on the market’s momentum during a sudden move.</p>
<p>Having a better understanding of position size is particularly important as new traders often oversize their positions in the market in the hopes of making big bucks. But in the process, they expose themselves to a lot of risk and can end up losing a lot of their capital. Therefore, traders should take a methodical approach to position sizing, based on the value of their account, the risk per trade and an invalidation point (which is a price at which the trade idea is considered invalid).</p>
<p>Suppose you have an account value of $10,000 and you’re willing to risk 3% (i.e. $300). Let’s say you’re looking to long ETH at $3,000, then the bullish idea is invalidated once the price goes below $2,700, since the risk you’re willing to take is equivalent to a $300 loss. Therefore, position size should be around 1 ETH.</p>

<description>
<div>Post-mining is a practice performed by developers that creates new coins following the launch of a cryptocurrency, but before public mining is possible. This allows the team to produce new coins without competition from external parties.</div>
<div>This sometimes occurs between the snapshot date — such as when token balances are counted so a newly created coin can be dropped or swapped on exchanges — but before code has been made public for outsiders to mine new coins.</div>
<p>Bitcoin Gold (BTG) conducted what many considered post-mining. The team behind the project produced 100,000 BTG between the snapshot date and the date that public mining began.</p>
<p>The founding team set aside 5,000 BTG for each of Bitcoin Gold’s six core members. The rest was left for growing the newly created currency’s ecosystem. But some saw these 100,000 BTG as a large amount for that purpose.</p>
<p>Coinbase did not support the launch of BTG, saying that the currency’s developers hadn’t made the code available to the public for review. The exchange considered this a “major security risk” — and a sense of negativity spread out across the community towards BTG.</p>
<div>BTG then suffered a 51% attack and, despite the team reacting and implementing an update to its mining algorithm, the damage had already been done.</div>

<description>
<p>Pre-IDO refers to token offerings before the actual initial DEX offering (IDO) takes place. It is an innovative concept that allows DeFi users to get exposure to new and upcoming crypto projects. On the other hand, a pre-IDO allows DeFi projects to increase their fundraising capability regardless of the market movements.</p>
<h2>What Is a Pre-IDO?</h2>
<div>Pre-IDO refers to projects offering coins or tokens before the initial DEX (decentralized exchange) offering, more commonly called an IDO. Unlike a pre-sale, where tokens are only offered to a selected group of investors, a pre-IDO allows everyone an opportunity to invest in upcoming DeFi projects.</div>
<p>Although IDOs are one way to raise funds for a project, the market condition plays a significant role in influencing the price of the tokens. However, with a pre-IDO, developers can raise funds regardless of the market volatility. The tokens offered in pre-IDOs are future unlocked tokens, meaning all tokens come with a lockup period predetermined before the launch of the pre-IDO. Each token is unlocked only when the lockup period expires.</p>
<p>Compared to an IDO, a pre-IDO offers more democratized investment access and relatively high price advantage. Moreover, there’s a lockup period, and investors get instant access to liquidity after listing. </p>
<h2>Advantages of Pre-IDOs</h2>
<p>Pre-IDO offers general users exposure to VC-style funding events. Generally, VC firms and institutional investors, with millions of dollars, invest in these projects. They get the first-mover advantage and enjoy a much lower price than the IDO. For instance, the token price for public rounds of IDOs is usually predetermined and higher than that of seed and private funding rounds. </p>
<p>Individual investors can invest and buy the project tokens at private investor and VC-level rates through a pre-IDO. This gives them the first-mover advantage and price advantages compared to purchasing tokens during the public IDO.</p>
<p>The concept of pre-IDO works in favor of the developers as well. Projects can raise funds and increase their capacity by hosting a pre-IDO. Furthermore, a pre-IDO allows developers to receive adequate funds for the project irrespective of the market ups and downs, allowing them to focus wholly on product development.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Pre-Mine?</h2>
<div>Pre-mining is the creation of a certain amount of cryptocurrency before the digital currency is made available to the public.</div>
<p>In the crypto world, pre-mining is a similar practice to selling a stake in a company to employees before the enterprise goes public via an initial public offering (IPO.)</p>
<div>In the case of a digital currency, the coins created beforehand — and set aside prior to the currency being launched — will create value for their holders after becoming tradable.</div>
<div>In most cases, these first coins would go to ICO investors, developers and team members that helped give birth to the currency.</div>
<div>Ethereum, the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization, is an example of a cryptocurrency that saw a large number of coins being pre-mined ahead of its ICO.</div>
<div>Unlike Bitcoin, for instance, pre-mined coins are usually held by a centralized authority, such as Ripple (XRP.) This digital currency was created for a centralized payment system that provides faster and cheaper ways to transfer funds in partnership with banks. Nevertheless, a large chunk of this cryptocurrency is owned by Ripple itself.</div>
<div>Some blockchain users are against pre-mining, while other believe it is a legitimate practice. Supporters argue it is fair to reward developers and employees who take part in the design and modelling of the project, and that it incentivizes their participation.</div>
<p>However, pre-mining remains a dark practice for many, as it generates distrust among users. Many developers would pre-mine and set aside a large number of coins before the ICO, without releasing this information to the public. Then, when the cryptocurrency is launched and prices are inflated due to lack of coins available, these developers would take their pre-mined coins back into the market, causing a steep decline in their price and damaging outsiders.</p>
<p>Pre-mining should not be mistaken for Premine, a cryptocurrency with the currency symbol PMC.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Pre-Sale?</h2>
<div>Pre-selling is a practice performed by some crypto projects ahead of an initial coin offering, in which tokens are sold to interested parties at a certain price.</div>
<div>This could be considered beneficial for both investors and the development team, if all was to go well and the digital currency was to be a success. While the project’s creators would receive much-needed funds to finalize the project, investors have the potential to acquire an altcoin that could be worth a lot more in the future.</div>
<p>Developers may also perform a pre-sale in order to create buzz ahead of the ICO, hoping for a price surge when the asset goes public.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that pre-selling can come with risks. If a project fails, investors can find themselves owning worthless tokens, unable to make a profit from their investment. This adds to the fact that, when the actual ICO takes place, the plethora of coins now available to the public might dampen the value of the ones they initially bought.</p>
<p>On the other hand, developers have to be wary of investors who might offload pre-sold token shortly after launch, making a decent profit.</p>
<div>It definitely doesn’t look good for a coin that recently underwent an ICO if early investors dump the coins they own at the first chance.</div>

<h2>What Is A Prediction Market?</h2>
<div>A prediction market is a platform that revolves around the speculation of the outcomes of events across a wide spectrum of industries. Unlike regular markets, where people speculate on the price of an asset, in predictions, you can speculate on the outcome of all kinds of events like election results, sporting events, and contest results. Recently, absurd predictions, like “the color of the outfit during a US presidential speech” or even “number of coronavirus cases” have been observed in prediction markets.</div>
<div>There are also, however, some prediction markets that use the parimutuel system where all punters back possible predictions and place their bets into a pool. The winning prediction takes the entire pool of bets and divides it among punters proportionally to their share of the winning stake. In this case, the organizer takes a small commission of the pot.</div>
<p>Because of the need to evaluate the predictions of many people, prediction markets rely on big sample sizes. So the more people participate, the more data they have, and the more accurate they are.</p>
<div>Many modern prediction markets use blockchain technology to offer different types of incentives to encourage people to bet on predictions. In general, some of the following strategies or mechanisms are practiced:</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Price Impact?</h2>
<p>Price impact is an expression used to describe the correlation between an incoming order and the change in the price of the asset involved caused by the trade.</p>
<p>Buy trades push the price of a given asset higher by exhausting the cheapest sell orders in the order book, while the opposite happens for selling trades. The extent to which the price moves as a result of trades largely depends on the liquidity of the trading pair affected. More liquid trading pairs will see a smaller price impact than those with lower trading volumes.</p>
<p>Traders — especially those trading on markets with limited liquidity or those who make big trades — have to keep in mind the impact of their trade on the asset price. Their second buy trade will on average be more expensive than the first one because of their impact on the market.</p>
<p>Monitoring and controlling price impact is one of the hottest areas of interest in research conducted by trading firms. Much effort is currently being dedicated to understanding how dependent the trade impact is on the trade size and how long it takes for its effect on asset price to manifest fully.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Private Blockchain?</h2>
<div>A private blockchain is a type of blockchain in which only a single organization has authority over the network. This implies that it is not open to anyone from the public to join. Existing private blockchain solutions all implement some form of authorization system to identify who is accessing the platform. Private blockchain solutions and platforms are typically developed for use in the internal networking system of an enterprise. The network model relies on trust and only the employees within a specific firm are able to be part of it.</div>
<div>Unlike a public blockchain, a private blockchain is not, therefore, decentralized. However, aspects of the system may in themselves be decentralized or distributed in their structure. Private blockchain platforms often involve regulations that public platforms do not have; for example, all of the nodes may need to abide by certain rules in order to ensure a proper workflow.</div>
<p>The upside of private blockchains is their high level of efficiency. This is in contrast to public blockchains, in which a large number of people use a lot of resources that the platform may not be able to support.</p>
<p>Another benefit is the higher level of privacy and discretion, due to the fact that fewer people have access to it.</p>
<p>Private blockchain solutions are useful for enterprises that need sophisticated and powerful technologies to back up their processes and facilitate their workflows. Implementation within the internal system of an enterprise thus remains the best use case for a private blockchain.</p>
<p>Private blockchain solutions are also known to be quite stable, as only a handful of people can initiate transactions, implying fewer delays and lower congestion.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Private Key/Secret Key?</h2>
<div>A private key generally refers to an alphanumeric string that is generated at the creation of a crypto wallet address and serves as its password or the access code. Whoever has access to a private key has absolute control over its corresponding wallet, access to the funds contained within, and can transfer or trade assets and use the account for other purposes. </div>
<div>Thanks to the irreversible nature of blockchain and the cryptographic derivation of private keys, it is impossible to change private keys. Therefore, once a user suspects that an unauthorized entity or person knows his private key, the only possible way to secure the funds is through creation of, and transfer to, a new wallet. </div>
<div>There are several ways in which the private keys are stored. The basic and the most vulnerable method is the direct seed code, for instance “e0c9795a7fcf4ad2b7a257952dc5151ab1c865a02d88a41b7885b5f4e15b5879”. </div>
<p>Some wallets also use general encrypted files accessible through a password, which is simply a level above raw key. However, the most common method is through generation of mnemonic 12-24 phrases using the BIP39 protocol. This makes them easier to remember but hard to guess; e.g “shampoo plane stingray gully mollusk anyway clarify observing echo bazooka heading replica.” </p>
<p>Interestingly, some wallets like the CoolWallet S hardware wallet uses numbers instead of words for its recovery seed and then uses a checksum to verify that it’s been correctly recorded at the end. This is to help non-English speakers avoid spelling mistakes such as “plan” instead of “plane.” Such a small mistake could make it impossible to access your wallet. </p>
<div>Regardless of the manner of generation and storage, it’s absolutely critical to safeguard private keys properly. Users are advised to store them offline instead of keeping them on an online device. </div>
<p>Another option is to write them on pieces of paper and keep them inside safes or deposit boxes. The most common way to safeguard them is by using hardware wallets in order for them to be kept offline. There is also a niche category of users that store them on specially designed holders made of titanium and other fire resistant robust materials.</p>

<title>Procedural Programming</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/procedural-programming</url>
<file>procedural-programming.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Procedural programming refers to a series of instructions that inform a computer what it should do step-by-step to achieve the task.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Procedural Programming?</h2>
<p>Procedural programming is usually the first paradigm that a developer learns. Fundamentally, the procedural code is the one that directly tells a device how to perform a task in logical phases. Based on the notion of a procedure call, procedural programming separates the program into procedures, which are sometimes known as routines or functions, simply having a set of actions to be carried out. This paradigm takes a linear top-down approach and sees data and methods as two independent entities.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of Procedural Programming</h2>
<div>Parameter Passing: Parameter passing is a technique used to pass parameters to functions, subroutines, or procedures. Parameter passing may be done by “pass by value”, “pass by reference”, “pass by result”, “pass by value-result” and “pass by the name”.</div>
<div>Local Variable: A local variable is defined in the main structure of a method and is confined to the local scope it is given. It can only be used in the method it is defined, and if it were to be used outside the defined method, the code will cease to operate.</div>
<div>Predefined Functions: A predefined function is often an instruction indicated by a name. Usually, the predefined functions are built into higher-level programming languages, but they are drawn from the library or the registry, rather than the program. </div>
<p>One example of a pre-defined function is ‘charAt()’, which looks for a character position in a string.</p>
<div>Modularity: Modularity is when two distinct systems have two different goals at hand but are brought together to finish a bigger job first. Every set of systems then would have its own tasks done one after the other until all tasks are accomplished.</div>
<div>Global Variable: A global variable is a variable that is declared outside every other function specified in the code. Due to this, global variables may be utilized in all functions, unlike a local variable.</div>
<h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) vs. Procedural Programming </h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that stores data (in the form of fields or attributes) and code in &quot;objects&quot; (in the form of procedures or methods). </p>
<div>Object-oriented programming is a top-down method of programming that uses the notion of objects to interact with the actual world. The majority of widely used programming languages, such as C++, Python, and Java, employ a variety of paradigms, including the object-oriented programming paradigm.</div>
<p>Procedural programming differs from object-oriented programming in that procedural programming is mostly focused on functions, whereas OOP is primarily based on objects. The following are some key distinctions between these two programming paradigms:</p>
<p>The Focus</p>
<p>Algorithms are the foundation of the procedural-oriented programming paradigm (a finite sequence of executable computer instructions) primarily concerned with the storage, manipulation, and administration of data.</p>
<p>Working Mechanism</p>
<p>In procedural programming, the fundamental strategy is to break down a difficult problem into smaller parts that are easier to comprehend, handle, and manage. </p>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP), on the other hand, concentrates on the objects to be processed rather than the technique or logic by which they will be handled.</p>
<p>The Origin</p>
<p>The procedural-oriented programming paradigm is developed from the imperative programming model, whereas the declarative programming paradigm is related to the OOP paradigm.</p>
<p>Division of Programs</p>
<p>A program is organized into functions or code blocks under the procedural programming paradigm. The function is the programming unit in this paradigm. The program is organized into multiple objects of classes under the object-oriented programming paradigm, and the programming unit is class.</p>
<p>Memory Requirement</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming’s data-oriented approach needs a large memory. </p>
<p>The procedure-oriented programming paradigm, on the other hand, works with extremely small memory.</p>
<div>Approach </div>
<p>Procedural-oriented languages use a top-down approach to problem-solving, breaking down a huge complicated problem into smaller sections that may be explored separately. </p>
<p>Object-oriented programming employs a bottom-up strategy, which entails assembling smaller chunks to build up a large object. </p>
<p>The former divides a huge program into smaller pieces, whereas the latter assembles a large program from a number of smaller ones. In this way, the procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming approaches are diametrically opposed.</p>
<p>Debugging and Repurposing Code</p>
<p>Debugging procedural languages is complex, but debugging object-oriented languages is simple and straightforward. Furthermore, compared to the procedural-oriented programming paradigm, object-oriented programming allows for considerably simpler reuse of code.</p>
<p>Storage of Data</p>
<p>In an object-oriented programming paradigm, data and related behavior are stored at a single location, whereas in a procedural-oriented programming paradigm, they are separated and stored in various areas. </p>
<p>Parallel programming is not supported by the procedural-oriented programming paradigm, but it is supported by the object-oriented programming model.</p>
<p>Communication</p>
<p>In the procedural-oriented programming paradigm, code is communicated by invoking the program's function.</p>
<p>In object-oriented programming, objects communicate with each other by passing messages.</p>
<h2>Examples of Procedural Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Haskell, C, Pascal, Fortran, and BASIC are some languages that enable a procedural-oriented programming paradigm. </p>
<p>C++, Python, and Java are well-known examples of languages that support the OOP paradigm.</p>

<title>Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) Statement</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/profit-and-loss-p-l-statement</url>
<file>profit-and-loss-p-l-statement.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement is a financial document that gives that sum up the earnings, costs, and expenditures incurred during a specified period.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) Statement?</h2>
<p>A Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) statement is a financial report, also known as an income statement, operating statement, earnings statement, or statement of operations.</p>
<p>The P&amp;L statement shows the company's revenue and expenses, including gains and losses. It lets you see how much profit the company is making or losing, which can help you make investment and business decisions.</p>
<p>The P&amp;L statement will show you how much money your company is bringing in (revenue), how much it spends to get that money (costs), and what's left once you subtract costs from revenue (net profit).</p>
<div>A P&amp;L report may be prepared for a division within a large company or for an entire corporation. The report may also be prepared as an internal document only and not included in filings with regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). When the SEC requires public companies to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, these reports must include a consolidated statement of operations.</div>
<p>Companies use the P&amp;L statement to:</p>
<p>Report income to investors, regulators, and tax collection agencies;</p>
<p>Assess profitability;</p>
<p>Identify areas where expenses can be reduced;</p>
<p>Guide future business decisions; and</p>
<p>Develop budgets.</p>
<h2>Profit and Loss vs. Cash Flow Statement</h2>
<p>A profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement is different from a cash flow statement. While the P&amp;L statement tracks revenue minus expenses over a period of time — typically each month or quarter — the cash flow statement tracks the movement of money into and out of your business during the same period.</p>
<h2>Components of Profit &amp; Loss Statement</h2>
<p>A profit and loss statement lists the following:</p>
<div>Sales Revenue: Money received by the company for goods or services, including discounts and deductions for returned merchandise.</div>
<div>Cost of Goods Sold: It is the direct costs associated with the production of the goods sold. COGS also involve the cost of materials &amp; labor spent on goods production. It doesn’t include indirect expenses such as costs of distributions &amp; sales force. </div>
<div>Gross Profit: This is what remains from sales revenue after subtracting the cost of goods sold. Gross profit will appear on an income statement before operating expenses are subtracted out.</div>
<div>Operating Expenses: Expenses relating to the company's main operations. Operating expenses include items such as rent, utilities, office supplies, etc. In addition, operating expenses may also include depreciation expense on equipment used in daily operations.</div>
<div>Operating Income: The excess of revenues over expenses from primary activities; it is calculated before taxes and interest charges are deducted and extraordinary items are included (if any). Operating income represents earnings before tax and interests. </div>
<p>The P&amp;L statement is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from total revenue. The COGS figure includes all direct costs associated with producing and selling products or services, such as labor, materials, and shipping. In other words, it includes everything that goes into making the product or service you sell to customers, minus any discounts from suppliers.</p>
<p>To calculate net income, you must also subtract operating expenses from total revenue. Operating expenses include all indirect costs such as administrative salaries, office supplies, and rent or utilities for your business location.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Programmability?</h2>
<p>Programmability implies that something is capable of following instructions — a capacity that sets the computer apart from other electronic devices. </p>
<p>Programmability therefore broadly describes the ability of a software program or hardware device to follow a set of coded instructions. If you take a look at your keyboard, you might identify special keys that are programmed to do specific things, such as muting the volume, changing the brightness of your screen, etc. </p>
<p>Within the crypto industry, there has been a lot of discussion surrounding how to extend this capacity to money itself: to create digital, programmable money.</p>
<div>To understand the distinctiveness of programmable money, keep in mind the general properties of money more broadly. When it comes to fiat currencies, it’s common to use physical coins or banknotes. As objects, these are in themselves worthless. The only reason why a $10 bill has value is due to the fact that it has been assigned that value by a central bank, which adheres to a shared system of juridical rules. Anyone who uses the dollar implicitly agrees to participate in these rules to abide by them.</div>
<div>Programmable money in the digital space, and especially when it comes to crypto, implies greater flexibility and the possibility of setting different rules altogether. These will define when, between whom and how value can be exchanged. Such new rules could support different functionalities and automated use-cases – for example the integration of smart contracts to manage payments for smart devices or streamline business processes. Programmability therefore opens the potential to reimagine how different parties — and even devices – transact with each other.</div>

<h2>What Is a Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP)?</h2>
<div>Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP) refers to a business offering to use the ERC-721 NFT protocol on Ethereum to ascribe individuals a unique, non-fungible blockchain-based identifier that only the person can access. POAP addresses the problem of identifying people rather than transactions or value, and it uses the blockchain that underpins digital assets and non-fungible tokens.</div>
<div>POAP provides event participants with a way to verify their attendance through collecting digital badges where they live on-chain. The badges are all unique, meaning that the only way to claim them is to receive them at the event. Each badge is visually unique and non-replicable, meaning it doubles as an NFT and can be traded as NFTs on exchanges. One of its key values is that it provides irrefutable proof that an individual had been to an event or studied at a certain place. For instance, proving to your future employers that you studied at Harvard or having a track record of highly successful work in your profession means that people are more likely to trust and value your expertise in the field.</div>
<div>POAP has two categories of users: event organizers and collectors. Event organizers can create events and make and distribute POAP badges to attendees. At the same time, collectors can bookmark moments in their lives or demonstrate their attendance to others with custom, unique NFT badges.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Authority (PoA)?</h2>
<div>Proof-of-authority (PoA) is an alternative consensus mechanism, which relies on known and reputable validators to produce blocks, and thus, provide computational power to a network. It enables relatively faster transactions using a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm with identity as a stake. </div>
<p>PoA is a type of consensus mechanism geared towards enterprises or private organizations who want to build their own chains that are essentially closed in nature and don’t require participation from general users. </p>
<div>Since a network running PoA is permissioned, it doesn’t require any “mining” activity. However, network participants can still deploy redundancy by running multiple nodes under the same identity.</div>
<div>This type of consensus mechanism isn’t resource intensive, but requires validators to preserve the integrity of their nodes. It can be understood as a mechanism, which provides incentivization to act honestly and in accordance with the proper functioning of a network, due to user identity and reputation at stake. </div>
<p>PoA requires three conditions to be met: </p>
<div>Moreover, these kinds of networks can borrow design and modes of operation from existing public blockchains like Ethereum or Cardano with notable changes.</div>

<preview>Proof-of-burn is an attempt at creating a system that can prevent fraudulent transactions on a blockchain and can also improve the overall efficiency and functioning of the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Burn?</h2>
<div>Some blockchain systems use proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) as their consensus mechanism; however, there is an alternative known as proof-of-burn (PoB).</div>
<p>Proof-of-burn is an attempt at creating a system that can prevent fraudulent transactions on a blockchain and can also improve the overall efficiency and functioning of the blockchain.</p>
<div>Keep in mind that the blockchain is the shared database for a given cryptocurrency, which contains all the transaction-related information within blocks. A block is written into the blockchain only once all the participant nodes reach a consensus regarding a set of transactions that they deem to be valid.</div>
<p>Now, due to the fact that this is autonomous and given the decentralized nature of blockchain networks, an automated mechanism is required in order to ensure that the nodes agree on truly valid transactions. This is a task that is typically performed by consensus mechanism algorithms.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Burn is a consensus mechanism that attempts to resolve the high energy consumption issues that plague PoW-based blockchains. </p>
<div>PoB allows miners to burn digital currency in order to gain the right to write blocks. To burn coins, miners have to send them to a verifiably unspendable wallet address, essentially permanently removing them from circulation. </div>
<p>This is a process that does not consume many resources, and therefore energy, and also ensures that the network can remain as active and as agile as possible. Miners are allowed either to burn the blockchain’s native currency or the currency of an alternative chain. In the latter case, they receive a reward in exchange, which is denominated in the native currency of the blockchain.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Burn (PoB)?</h2>
<div>Proof-of-burn (PoB) is a blockchain consensus mechanism with minimal energy consumption, compared to proof-of-work (PoW). Decentralized platforms employing the PoB method ensure miners reach a consensus by burning coins. Burning is the process of permanently eliminating cryptos from circulation. Although the practice reduces inflation, PoB-powered blockchains use it to validate transactions.</div>
<div>However, unlike in PoW-based decentralized platforms like Bitcoin, Proof-of-Burn uses virtual mining rigs instead of physical ones to validate transactions. Simply put, PoB miners initiate coin burns as a way to show their involvement in the network and be allowed to mine.</div>
<div>How many coins a miner burns demonstrates his virtual mining power. Therefore, the more coins, the higher the power and vice versa. Note that just like in PoW systems, higher mining power improves the speed of finding new blocks. Consequently, the miner earns more rewards.</div>
<div>On proof-of-burn (PoB) networks, the coin burn process involves sending the coins to an “eater address.” This address is publicly verifiable but inaccessible. Note that eater addresses are randomized and they don’t have private keys.</div>
<div>Proof-of-burn is similar to proof-of-stake (PoS) in the sense that both consensus mechanisms involve interaction with coins to secure the network. However, unlike PoB, coins locked in PoS systems aren’t permanently erased; their holders can still access and sell them in case they want to leave the network. On the other hand, PoB, unlike PoS, leads to a coin scarcity.</div>
<div>Note that the PoB mechanism is a new type of consensus algorithm. As such, it hasn’t been proven to work on large networks yet. Some advantages of the PoB mechanism is that it is sustainable and its mining process is highly decentralized.</div>

<h2>What Is Proof-of-Developer (PoD)?</h2>
<div>Proof-of-developer (PoD) is a process that seeks to connect a blockchain project with its real developer or developers. The process prevents fraudsters from taking over a project, especially the funding, without delivering the final product to investors. Proof-of-developer is common with cryptocurrency-based projects.</div>
<div>PoD started in 2014 when crypto investors suffered losses emanating from pumps and dumps. These are scenarios in the digital currency space where a coin’s developers or malicious investors artificially inflate the prices. When their holdings attract a good ROI, they “dump” or sell them, causing the price to tank resulting with other investors incurring losses.</div>
<div>Proof-of-developer was launched at a time when initial coin offerings (ICOs) were gaining momentum. Some ICO issuers were only out to defraud unsuspecting investors. PoD enables investors to look beyond the glittering ROI values and see whether an ICO project has, in fact, living and real developers.</div>
<p>Additionally, proof-of-developer assists in unearthing individuals who are simply copy-pasting other crypto codes and marketing them as their own original projects with the intention of attracting investments.</p>
<p>The PoD mechanism stores developers’ names, country of origin, individual social media handles and personal email addresses. Moreover, the process involves verifying the details and ascertaining the developers’ education level and GitHub page.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Donation?</h2>
<p>Proof-of-donation refers to the integration of charitable donations into the functionality of a blockchain. Typically, this describes a redirection of funds, set by a smart contract and triggered upon each transaction, toward a charitable destination. The charitable donation can be given to a wallet owned by a charity, or a separate fund whose funds are controlled by a DAO or other party.</p>
<p>Proof-of-donation is a modification of a traditional proof-of-burn that aims to bring altruism and sustainability to the blockchain transfer model. As blockchain activity scales, given the programmatic redistribution of funds, the charitable donations will likewise scale and contribute to the sustainable growth of the network. </p>
<p>An example of proof-of-donation is that employed by Hermez Network: coordinators bid for the right to process transaction batches using the token HEZ; 40% of each winning bid is donated to Gitcoin as a way to fund Ethereum public goods, while 30% is burned and 30% is redistributed to the network. </p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Proof of History (PoH) nodes have internal clocks that validate events and time. The incoming events are hashed using a verifiable delay function, also known as VDF.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-History (PoH)?</h2>
<div>Deployed by Solana, Proof of History (PoH) is a method of incorporating time itself into the blockchain, attempting to reduce the load on network nodes while processing blocks. In a traditional blockchain, gaining consensus on the time a block was mined is just as important as getting consensus on the transactions in that block. Because timestamping informs the network (and any observer) that transactions occurred in a specific order, it is crucial.</div>
<div>The successful block miner in a Proof of Work (PoW) scenario is the first to determine the proper nonce, which takes a given amount of computer power. Proof of History (PoH), on the other hand, employs Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs). Only a single CPU core can solve a VDF by performing a certain set of consecutive steps. Because no parallel processing is permitted, it is simple to determine how long each step will take. </div>
<p>Proof of History (PoH) overcomes the time barrier, making blockchain lighter and quicker by reducing the processing weight. Solana combines Proof of History (PoH) with Tower Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Tower BFT), a security system that allows users to stake tokens to vote on the validity of a PoH hash. </p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Low Fee: Solana offers cheaper transaction fees in comparison to other networks, such as Ethereum. As a consequence, Solana is an excellent choice for frequent transactions and money transfers.</p>
<p>Scalability: Transactions on the Solana network are quick. As a result, the whole picture gains scalability.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
<div>Solana presently employs less than 1,200 validators to validate transactions on its network.</div>
<div>Solana is sometimes referred to as an Ethereum killer however there are fewer dApps on the network in comparison. On Solana, around 350 dApps have been developed, but on Ethereum, over 3,000 dApps have been built.</div>
<h2>Proof of History (PoH) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)</h2>
<div>Proof of Stake and Proof of History are quite similar. This is due to the fact that Proof of Stake evolved into Proof of History. Both algorithms are built on the same foundation. Validators are used in both algorithms to guarantee that transactions are validated and new blocks are created.</div>
<p>However, there is a significant difference between these two methods in terms of how time is calculated. The timestamp function is used in Proof of Stake. This means that each node relies on the network's timestamp. Because time must flow via the network first, the network will operate slower.</p>
<p>This isn't essential with Proof of History since it employs the Verifiable Delay Function, which calculates the time based on historical occurrences. After analyzing these occurrences, a hash function is constructed that can be confirmed by anybody. Every block created by the network has this hash appended to it. This method of determining the time takes essentially little time, making the Solana blockchain incredibly scalable at the moment.</p>
<h2>Potential Issues with Proof of History (PoH)</h2>
<p>Proof of History is a consensus mechanism based on Proof of Stake, but with a different method of calculating time. Historical events are now used to determine the passage of time. These events are transformed into a hash, which can only be generated by previous events. The hash cannot be forged in any way.</p>
<p>Solana is the only blockchain that employs the Proof of History algorithm. Therefore, the blockchain is incredibly scalable, capable of processing up to 60,000 transactions per second. PoH guarantees that determining the timing of a transaction takes less time.</p>
<p>Proof of History, on the other hand, has a number of flaws. For example, this method has never been put to the test on a wide scale, so we don't know if it actually works flawlessly. Furthermore, various vulnerabilities and attacks in Solana have been discovered in the past, some of which were caused in part by Proof of History. As a result, we're not sure if Proof of History is a safe consensus mechanism yet.</p>

<preview>Proof-of-Immutability (PoIM) enables the blockchain to persist data in a decentralized and provably immutable manner, without having to distribute the data among nodes.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Immutability (PoIM)?</h2>
<div>Proof-of-Immutability (PoIM) is a type of blockchain system that utilizes a sophisticated hash-based approach to store blockchain metadata in a remote hash vault. A PoIM-powered blockchain network upholds the highest data privacy standards, as the data appended to the ledger is not copied and distributed among network nodes, rather, a hash pointer with no traceable metadata is. This approach also empowers a blockchain to scale and attain high throughput without hurting its decentralized nature. </div>
<div>The PoIM system allows participants of the blockchain network to inspect the trustworthiness of one another’s data (by proving its immutability), at any time, without invading the inspected party’s data privacy. This mechanism for proving immutability may sound redundant at first, as immutability is perceived to be something inherent to all blockchains. Indeed, blockchain as a distributed ledger technology enjoys a higher level of immutability compared to centralized database systems, however, the degree of immutability varies among different blockchains, depending on factors such as consensus mechanism and the size of membership. For example, a permissioned/private blockchain network is usually smaller in size and therefore easier to manipulate. PoIM provides a mechanism that allows participants to check whether the chain has been manipulated or a piece of record has been altered, without accessing the database. In addition, as real-world adoption gains speed, an auditing mechanism for validating information integrity within the blockchain ledger plays a key role in propelling the legal recognition of blockchain data and smart contracts.</div>
<div>Note: PoIM is invented by ParallelChain Lab. Its processes and methods have been applied for patents (US-2021-0297265-A1; US-2021-0218549-A1; EP3848845; CN2021102000629400). PoIM had its first implementation on ParallelChain Private. It is expected to be implemented in “Inter-ParallelChain Communication” to satisfy the trust and data privacy protection requirements for permissioned and permissionless networks to interoperate in the Web3 ecosystem.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Replication?</h2>
<p>Proof-of-replication (PoRep), often used in reference to Filecoin, is the way that a storage miner proves to the Filecoin (or other) network that they have an entirely unique copy of a piece of data held for the network.</p>
<p>Proof-of-replication acts as a proof-of-retrievability mechanism inside of a proof-of-space mechanism. What does that actually mean? It means that PoRep allows a “prover” to show that they are really and truly using space to store replicas of a piece of information or data. Not only that, but PoRep means that the data that the prover is storing can easily be accessed, aka “retrieved.” </p>
<p>In a proof-of-replication system, participants in the network want to join in as provers and store as much data as they can, because they get network rewards in exchange for their storage space. </p>
<p>Some critics of proof-of-replication systems argue that while the use of proof-of-replication by storage providers creates durability (aka provides the assurance that data will be available even in the case of node failures), PoRep overlooks the fact that the replicated data must be transferred every time a new node is added to the redundancy pool — which can take up bandwidth.</p>

<h2>What Is Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt)?</h2>
<p>Proof-of-spacetime (PoSt), usually used in reference to Filecoin, is that way that a storage miner proves that they are continuing to store a unique piece of data for the network.</p>
<p>PoSt is similar to proof-of-capacity in several ways: they both require participants in the network to have a financial incentive to participate honestly in the network, and have no benefit gained by harming the network. However, PoSt differs in that it lets network participants show that they have been physically storing data over a certain period of time. This is proved as randomly chosen miners will be selected and have their data read for verifications.</p>
<div>According to the creators of proof-of-spacetime, Tal Moran and Ilan Orlov, this is called the “'Rational' Proofs of Space-Time because the true cost of storage is proportional to the product of storage capacity and the time that it is used.”</div>

<preview>A blockchain consensus mechanism in addition to Proof-of-Work that maintains the integrity of blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?</h2>
<p>PoS is another consensus mechanism, the method by which blockchain confirms transactions and prevents the problem of double counting.</p>
<p>Double counting occurs when the same coin or token is used for more than one transaction.</p>
<div>While Proof-of-Work is used for Bitcoin  transactions, PoS was created to work as a powerful alternative.</div>
<p>Many researchers believe PoS is significantly more energy efficient compared to PoW and more secure, although some critics question the integrity of these claims.</p>
<p>It is relatively quite easy to spot double counting in a centralized environment, such as a bank overseeing fiat money.</p>
<div>But double counting under cryptocurrencies, which rely on decentralized systems, would be very hard to prevent if it were not for PoW or PoS.</div>
<p>Industry participants often point out that Bitcoin uses the amount of energy as Switzerland — highlighting the level of strain cryptocurrencies put on electricity systems.</p>
<div>Proof-of-Stake involves miners validating additional blocks if they have greater amounts of money locked up in the system.</div>
<p>To illustrate an example, a miner who owns 10% of coins of Bitcoin will only be able to mine 10% of the blocks.</p>
<div>Sometimes energy costs are so high under PoW that miners need to sell coins in order to pay their energy bills.</div>
<p>PoS’ structure means the mechanism can be less vulnerable to cyberattacks as its structure acts as a disincentive for a miner to attack the system due to the structural way the system ranks compensation.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Proof-of-Time (PoT) is a decentralized, scalable, verifiably secure, and environmentally-friendly consensus algorithm.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Time (PoT)?</h2>
<div>Proof-of-Time (PoT) is a decentralized consensus algorithm that works by selecting validators in proportion to their ranking scores and fixed stake. A ranking score is a numerical weighting measure that the algorithm assigns to each validator based on its historical experience (the accuracy with which the node validates event data) and other validators’ experience with the validator. </div>
<div>On the other hand, a fixed stake is a staking mechanism where all the validators stake an equal amount of tokens—the platform’s native asset—to participate in the consensus process. Unlike typical proof-of-stake (PoS), where nodes must stake large amounts of tokens to be considered for consensus, the PoT mechanism is fair. Any node can participate as a validator provided it has staked a fixed amount of tokens and accumulated a ranking score. </div>
<p>PoT consensus relies on the verifiable delay function (VDF) to pick block proposers (time electors) and block confirmers (time nodes) pseudorandomly. As long as a node has accumulated a high ranking score and has staked an equal amount of tokens, it has a higher chance of being pseudo-randomly selected to propose or confirm blocks.</p>
<h2>The Proof-of-Time Process</h2>
<p>The entire Proof-of-Time consensus mechanism is a two-step process and consists of four categories of nodes.</p>
<div>Nodes:</div>
<div>Publishers- nodes that submit event data to the main chain</div>
<div>Time Electors - nodes that propose blocks on the main chain</div>
<div>Time Nodes - nodes that confirm blocks to the main chain</div>
<div>Tesseract Nodes - nodes that participate in the interoperability processes</div>
<p>Process:</p>
<div>Soft Voting - This stage begins when the broadcaster submits event data to the network. A randomly selected time elector is then responsible for collating the submitted event data, verifying its signature, and computing VDF. Once accomplished, the time elector relays the hashed event data and the VDF proof to the remainder of the time nodes.</div>
<div>Hard Voting - As soon as the time nodes receive the data, it triggers the hard voting phase. In this phase, a committee of 1,000 time nodes (all of whom are selected via VDF) jointly determines if the submitted transaction is valid. If the majority of the time nodes vote to accept the proposed block, it gets appended to the main chain.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Proof-of-validation (PoV) is a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that works to achieve consensus through staked validator nodes.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Validation?</h2>
<div>Proof-of-validation (PoV) is a unique proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism that works to achieve consensus through staked validator nodes. Each node within a PoV system keeps a complete copy of the sequence of transactions in blocks that are created on the blockchain. A copy of all of the user accounts can then be identified by a user's public key, as well as whichever crypto token that node owns.</div>
<p>From this point onwards, a user can stake their coins inside of the validator nodes. The number of tokens staked within each validator will consequently determine the number of nodes that a specific validator possesses.</p>
<div>A new block is confirmed once a set of validators, with at least two-thirds of the network’s total voting power, send a commit vote for that block. This means that PoV protocols can be Byzantine fault tolerant, and they can only remain healthy if one-third or less of the network's total nodes get compromised.</div>

<preview>A blockchain consensus mechanism involving solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. *see Proof-of-Stake (PoS).</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Proof-of-Work (PoW)?</h2>
<div>In contrast to fiat money which is typically regulated by a central authority such as a bank, cryptocurrencies are decentralized.</div>
<div>PoW paves the way for many cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum to work without the involvement of a government or company.</div>
<p>This consensus mechanism is crucial to avoiding double spending — ensuring that a coin or token isn't used more than once to facilitate a transaction.</p>
<p>It is the key process behind adding new blocks to Bitcoin’s blockchain and verifying transactions.  </p>
<p>The network approves a block each time a cryptocurrency miner successfully completes PoW behind the block.</p>
<div>Miners are rewarded with BTC if they successfully solve the PoW.</div>
<div>In the case of BTC, cryptocurrency miners are tasked with the objective of creating a hash matching Bitcoin’s current target.</div>
<p>This consists of a hash which is frontloaded with multiple zeros. The probability of achieving a hash that has several zeros at the front is rather low.</p>
<p>The person who achieves the goal first earns BTC.</p>
<p>The reason why PoW makes it so difficult to tamper with any part of the blockchain has to do with the fact that any alteration would require all blocks to be edited.</p>

<preview>A protocol layer of the blockchain is defined as the rules and processes that govern how the network will operate.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Protocol Layer?</h2>
<div>The protocol layer of the blockchain is the foundation of the blockchain network. Developers can extend this layer to create new rules for their blockchain networks. They can design new transactions and smart contracts that conform to the rules of their blockchains.</div>
<p>The protocol layer is a set of rules and designs that establish:</p>
<p>The ability to transfer value from one address to another</p>
<p>The ability to record transactions in a ledger</p>
<p>The requirements for creating new blocks, or transactions, in the chain</p>
<div>A mechanism for reaching a consensus among network participants on which transactions are valid, and which order they should go in</div>
<p>The block creation process, including the types of transactions included in a block</p>
<div>The process for adding nodes to the network</div>
<div>The process for mining new blocks.</div>
<p>The rules for adding information to a blockchain can be simple or complex and are determined by the protocol layer.</p>
<p>The most basic rule for adding information to a blockchain is that all participants in the network must agree on the information that is being added and the time it is added.</p>
<div>The protocol layer includes a consensus mechanism that allows all participants in the network to reach an agreement on what information is added and when it is added. Consensus mechanisms are used to prevent network attacks, such as double-spending, where an attacker attempts to spend funds twice by spending a coin on two different transactions at roughly the same time.</div>
<div>The Bitcoin protocol uses proof of work as its consensus mechanism. Proof of work allows anyone with enough computing power to add a block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. It also greatly increases the cost of attacking the network since an attacker would need to control over half of the computing power on the network in order to successfully double-spend coins.</div>
<p>The blockchain consists of different layers:</p>
<div>Application Layer: It is responsible for interacting with the user, e.g., an end-user or a developer who wants to develop dApps based on that particular blockchain. Ethereum Wallet, Metamask, etc, come under this category.</div>
<div>Contract Layer: This layer includes smart contracts which are responsible for executing transactions and changing the state. It includes Solidity (Ethereum), Neo Contract(Neo), etc.</div>
<div>Protocol Layer: It defines how transactions can be added to the public ledger, and how new nodes may join and sync with an existing blockchain network. It includes consensus protocols like PoW (Bitcoin), dBFT(NEO), etc, and P2P networking layer, like TCP/IP (Bitcoin), Devp2p (Ethereum).</div>

<h2>What Is a Public Blockchain?</h2>
<div>A public blockchain is a decentralized platform accessible by anyone. In other words, it is permissionless, meaning anyone can join, write and read the information on the platform. A blockchain is a distributed ledger where transaction data is packaged and stored in the form of blocks.</div>
<div>Therefore, a combination of these “blocks” forms a blockchain. A key factor that differentiates one block from the other is the timestamp. Once validated, data stored on the platform can’t be altered despite being publicly available.</div>
<div>A public blockchain uses a consensus mechanism to validate transactions. The leading two public blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. However, Ethereum has started the journey to transition into a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.</div>
<div>A public blockchain offers greater transparency compared to private networks, and is more decentralized since anyone can join and no single entity has control over the whole system. Unfortunately, a lot of public blockchains also suffer from low transaction speeds and other scalability issues. Furthermore, a public blockchain is also limited to a few consensus mechanisms compared to a private blockchain.</div>
<div>A private and public blockchain are similar in the sense that each node on their network has an exact copy of their ledger, their stored data is immutable and both platforms rely on transaction validators.</div>

<h2>What Is a Public Key?</h2>
<div>A public key refers to a series of alphanumeric characters used to encrypt plain text messages into ciphertext. A public key is used in conducting peer-to-peer transactions without the need to reveal the composition of one’s private keys, supporting a cryptographic function that allows for a safe and secure exchange of assets and information without the need for a third party.</div>
<p>A user provides his public key in order to engage in a peer-to-peer transaction with any individual. They can also keep this key publicly available. All private keys, which are secret keys used to access crypto funds, are associated with a corresponding particular public key since they are mutually generated using advanced asymmetric algorithm systems. This ensures that no one can derive the private key of any user just by knowing their public keys.</p>
<div>To better understand how both function together, a private key can be viewed as a security feature that encrypts a transaction to prevent anyone from getting unauthorized access over an asset while a public key is a feature that decrypts the private key in order to authorize access. In the cryptocurrency space, a public key allows you to receive tokens and the private key allows you to prove that you are the real owner of the token you are receiving.</div>

<preview>A public sale is the final stage of an ICO in which a company offers its token to the public at a significant discount before the token is listed on cryptocurrency exchanges.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Public Sale?</h2>
<p>In the blockchain world, the public sale is a term used when a company/project makes their tokens/coins available to the general public, (mostly) before the token is listed on cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<div>It has become a trend in the cryptocurrency market for blockchain companies to sell specific tokens or coins of a specific project and then launch their platform or app with the capital raised from the sales. This phenomenon is known as an ICO, and it is similar to next-generation crowdfunding.</div>
<div>The main concept behind an ICO is the ability to offer crypto tokens to investors and sell them in exchange for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Participants can sell or trade their assets at 3 or even 100 times the original price on all cryptocurrency exchanges.</div>
<p>The ICO is generally divided into three stages:</p>
<p>Private sale</p>
<p>Pre-sale</p>
<p>Public sale</p>
<p>To participate in all three phases, simply do the following: </p>
<p>First, convert fiat to cryptocurrencies, such as ETH or Bitcoin. Place it on your blockchain wallet. Participate in the initial coin offering (ICO) and finally secure your new tokens.</p>
<div>Most of the token sales these days actually occur on the Ethereum blockchain, using a smart contract to collect Ethereum tokens and instantly swap them for a new token issued by the startup. There are no exchanges or brokers involved, thus this is totally peer-to-peer.</div>
<p>The ICO begins with a private sale in which select people who align with the ICO goals are chosen and can purchase tokens before the tokens are available to the general public. Then they proceed to the presale, which is an exclusive &quot;early bird&quot; opportunity for people to purchase coins before the ICO is made public.</p>
<p>The presale period is an effective way for companies or projects to accumulate fund and use it to launch an effective marketing campaign before the project or app is fully launched. For investors, it is a good way to get a higher discount or bonus than a crowd sale while avoiding the drawbacks or risks that may occur during a private sale. </p>
<p>The ICO crowd sale, also known as the public sale, is the most important stage in the ICO's journey to success, so it is promoted and advertised more widely than the presale. Because it is one of the final stages of the token sale, it is possible to avoid the downsides or risks that may occur during a private sale. </p>
<p>However, there are fewer bonuses or discounts available than during the presale or crowd sale periods. The bonus and the discount system greatly depend on the number of investments people are willing to make, the offers can be similar to the private and presale campaigns.</p>
<p>Advantages include:</p>
<p>One can predict the ICO result at the public sale based on the previous two campaigns.</p>
<p>The project at this stage also has a minimal risk because it is more developed.</p>
<div>Greater liquidity, because there is less time to trade the token.</div>
<p>There is lesser scope of crypto volatility that affects the price of the cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Some tradeoffs can be:</p>
<p>Lower discounts compared to the presale period.</p>
<p>There is a possibility of a lower maximum cap per investor.</p>
<p>Chances are that the public sale can be called off on the occasion of the tokens being sold out during the presale period.</p>
<p>There are chances of token dump when bought at a discount.</p>

<preview>Public-key cryptography is a collection of algorithms-based cryptographic procedures that are used to jumble secret data and make it look randomized.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Public-Key Cryptography?</h2>
<div>Public-key cryptography entails two keys: a private key and a public key. These keys contain a piece of information that is used to scramble data and make it appear random. Only with the correct key can the messages be unencrypted and decrypted.</div>
<p>For instance, suppose we take a plaintext message, &quot;Cool,&quot; and encrypt it with a key, say &quot;323vjhqwhdj.&quot; Our message &quot;Cool&quot; has been encrypted with this key, and it now reads &quot;X5xJCSycg14=&quot;, which appears to be random garbage data. However, we can recover &quot;Cool&quot; by decrypting it with the same key.</p>
<div>To prevent unauthorized access to data, the protocol employs a pair of keys that encrypt and decrypt it. The certification authorities provide the network's users with a public and a private key. If other users want to encrypt data, they obtain the public key of the intended recipient from a public directory. This key is used to encrypt and send the message to the recipient. Later on, it is decrypted by the recipient using a private key to which no one else has access.</div>
<div>The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm is a public key cryptography system that is widely used when sending secure, sensitive information over an insecure network, such as the internet. The RSA algorithm is helpful because it allows both public and private keys to encrypt messages while maintaining their authenticity and integrity. Other cryptosystems include Diffie-Hellman, DSS, and Elliptic Curve.</div>

<file>public-key-infrastructure.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a collection of roles, rules, hardware, software, and processes for creating, managing, distributing, using, storing, and revoking digital certificates.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Public-Key Infrastructure?</h2>
<p>Public-key infrastructure is a framework that includes tools for creating public keys for encryption, which ensures that information transferred on the internet is secure.</p>
<p>All modern web browsers have PKI inbuilt in them that aids the security of web traffic of users on the network. Many organizations use it to secure internal communications and often it is also used to ensure that connected devices are safe.</p>
<div>The PKI technology is also associated with cryptographic keys that encrypt and serve authenticated users and devices in the digital environment. To verify that a specific key belongs to a user or device, the PKI involves one more trusted party to certify the authentication through digital signs. The key then works as the digital identity of the user on the network.</div>
<p>Most computers and web browsers trust many certificate authorities by default.</p>
<p>The foundation of public key infrastructure is digital signature technology, which employs public-key cryptography to create each entity's secret key which is only known to that entity and is used for signing. In addition to a user or device, it could be a program, process, manufacturer, component, or something else that can be linked to a key that serves as the identity of an entity.</p>
<p>The public key, which is derived from a private one, is made accessible to the public and is commonly included in the certificate document.</p>
<p>A certificate authority is a trusted third party who signs the document that links the key to the device. Furthermore, it possesses a cryptographic key that is used to sign these documents. These are known as certificates.</p>
<p>PKI is important because it involves encryption and identity verification that enables trustworthy, secure online communication. For example, in a firm, PKI can verify an intruder trying to gain access to the network via a connected device which in turn helps to keep a dangerous threat at bay.</p>
<p>PKI operates by utilizing two main systems: certificates and keys. A key is a series of numbers that is used to encrypt data. The key formula is used to encrypt each element of a message. For instance, suppose a plaintext message, &quot;Cool,&quot; is encrypted with a key, say &quot;323vjhqwhdj.&quot; Our message &quot;Cool&quot; has been encrypted with this key, and it now reads &quot;X5xJCSycg14=&quot;, which appears to be random garbage data. If someone obtains this key, they will receive what appears to be a meaningless message and decrypt it.</p>
<p>The public key is freely available to anyone and is used to encrypt messages sent to you. After receiving the message, you use a private key to decrypt it. A complex mathematical calculation is used to connect the keys. Even though the private and public keys are linked, this complex calculation facilitates the link. As a result, determining the private key using information from the public key is exceptionally hard.</p>
<p>Certificates verify the person or device you want to communicate with. When the proper certificate is associated with a device, it is considered valid. The authenticity of the certificate can be verified using a system that identifies whether it is genuine or not.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Pump and Dump (P&amp;D) Scheme?</h2>
<div>As cryptocurrencies have risen in prominence in recent years, so has the number of P&amp;D schemes taking place in the crypto space.</div>
<p>P&amp;D crypto schemes work when a group of co-ordinated cryptocurrency traders target a specific coin aimed at artificially driving demand for the coin.</p>
<p>The pump and dumpers not only choose a coin, but they also target a specific exchange.</p>
<div>Their aim is usually to drive up the volume of the selected coin. They normally target coins which have low volumes.</div>
<p>As the price of the targeted coin creeps up, many traders unrelated to the coin usually flock to it, driving up demand and price for it.</p>
<p>The coordinated action is usually repeated later in the opposite direction, where the organizers exit the market, normally once a specific price target has been met.</p>
<p>The result usually is a dramatic decline in the price of the coin, leading to huge losses for the traders who were unaware of the scheme and bought the coin based on unrealistic and false expectations.</p>
<p>Traders involved in P&amp;D schemes normally coordinate the act using communication platforms such as Discord and Telegram.</p>
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, P&amp;D schemes related to cryptocurrency markets accounted for $825 million worth of trading activity between February and August 2018.</p>
<p>The core organizers of P&amp;D schemes are usually the ones who stand to make the most profit at the expense of traders who bought into the false expectations.</p>

<preview>Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) is Algorand’s consensus mechanism that allows random selection of validators based on the consistency of their stakes.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS)?</h2>
<div>Algorand uses the Pure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, which is built on Byzantine consensus. In this approach, the influence of each user on a new block is dependent on their stake. The system secretly and randomly selects users when it comes to creating new blocks and voting on block proposals.</div>
<p>The likelihood of a user getting chosen in the creation of new blocks is proportional to their stake.</p>
<div>The PoS consensus mechanism is based on the premise that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to their stake (i.e., the number of coins that they hold). If someone owns 3% of the coins available, then it means that they can theoretically mine or validate 3% of the total transactions.</div>
<p>The primary benefit of this is that it makes mining accessible to individuals who don’t necessarily have the resources to participate in traditional mining. Instead of requiring expensive and energy-consuming hardware, all a person needs is a computer with an internet connection and some coins!</p>
<p>Algorand is a pure proof of stake blockchain protocol that achieves scale, security and decentralization. It was developed by Silvio Micali, Turing Award winner and professor at MIT.</p>
<p>Algorand solves fundamental problems faced by other blockchain protocols:</p>
<div>Scale – The transaction throughput problem faced by blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum can be solved with Algorand’s near-instantaneous transaction finality.</div>
<p>Security – Enabled by pure proof of stake and an elegant Byzantine Agreement scheme, Algorand has provable asymptotic security against Byzantine adversaries.</p>
<p>Decentralization – With a homogeneous token distribution, Algorand empowers a truly decentralized network with no special roles or nodes.</p>
<p>Algorand is a scalable blockchain platform designed to be simple, secure, and efficient. The blockchain is built on the concept of Proof of Stake (PoS), which ensures that participants with the highest value in the system are selected to validate transactions. This approach eliminates the need for high energy consumption (and cost) as well as complex network structures, which are required to maintain a PoW blockchain.</p>
<p>The Algorand platform employs two types of participants: users and nodes. Users transact using the Algorand platform by sending or receiving tokens to other users. Nodes participate in the network by processing transactions and securing them. The system also features special nodes called Block Producers (BPs), which perform all functions of an ordinary node as well as verify blocks in the system by signing them.</p>
<p>At launch, the first million blocks were pre-mined. Afterward, new blocks are created every five seconds at random intervals. The block creation process starts with a set of randomly selected BPs choosing a leader for each block cycle. A leader is elected by means of a multi-round Byzantine agreement protocol called the Binary Byzantine Agreement (BBA). During this process, BPs communicate with each other offline until they reach a consensus about who will become a block proposer.</p>

<preview>A put option contract offers an owner the opportunity, but not the compulsion, to buy an underlying security at a certain price within a given time frame.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is A Put Option?</h2>
<div>When the price of an asset decreases, the value of a put option rises. The attractiveness of put options is that they provide a short position in the underlying asset. This is why they are mostly used for hedging to speculate on the downside price action.</div>
<div>The bearer of a put option can place a protective put which serves as a great risk management strategy to avoid losses up to a certain price, also known as the strike price. </div>
<div>Brokerages and financial exchanges are where put options, as well as many other forms of options, are exchanged. Options traders can make use of unique features and perks offered by some brokers. Many brokers that specialize in options trading offer their services to interested buyers. It is critical to choose a broker who is suitable for your investing requirements.</div>
<div>For a specific period, the put buyer has the right to sell an asset at the strike price. They deposit a premium for gaining that privilege. If the underlying price falls below the strike price, the option will be profitable, meaning it will have intrinsic value. </div>
<div>As the price of the underlying asset falls, the valuation of a put option grows, resulting in a higher premium. When the asset/stock/currency price rises, the premium for a put option falls or loses value. When put options are exercised, they provide investors with a sell position in the asset. As a result, these are frequently utilized to hedge or protect a long asset position against negative movements.</div>
<div>Stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities, futures, and indices are all traded as underlying assets for put options. They are critical to identifying when deciding whether to do a straddle or a strangle.</div>
<p>Due to the chance of the stock dropping below the stated strike price as the time to expiration approaches, the worth of a put option generally drops as the time to expiration approaches. Selling the option contract back to the market is a substitute for executing the option. The simplest and most popular technique of closing an option position is to sell it. In other words, the investor does not swap shares; instead, the change in the option's price results in a net gain or loss for the investor.</p>
<div>Options (Call &amp; Put) are a part of traditional financial markets. The primary distinction between trading traditional options and crypto options is that the crypto market is open 24/7, whereas regular financial markets are only open at specific times and days. Crypto markets are also more volatile, which means that the price fluctuates more frequently and severely.</div>

<h2>What Is a Pyramid Scheme?</h2>
<div>A pyramid scheme, like a Ponzi Scheme, is a “get-rich-quick” swindle that benefits those who sit at the top of the organization.</div>
<div>With pyramid scheme, there doesn’t need to be a specific product for sale. Instead, the scheme may prey on individuals seeking to make money by asking them to pay a fee to join the organization. Those who join are promised money from the individuals that they recruit. The pyramid scheme is structured such that those on top gain money, while those on the bottom typically lose money. Pyramid schemes are one of the oldest scams in the book, but unfortunately remain to be relevant due to their predatory and manipulative tactics. </div>

<h2>What Is a QR Code?</h2>
<div>For cryptocurrencies, QR codes are often used to easily share wallet addresses with others.</div>
<div>For users to send or receive payments, a Bitcoin address is required.</div>
<p>The problem with a Bitcoin address is that they are quite long and difficult to remember.</p>
<p>Using a Bitcoin QR Generator which converts a Bitcoin address into a QR Code allows a user to send or receive crypto payments by simply just scanning the QR code.</p>
<p>A label can also be added to the QR code to indicate the desired amount that needs to be sent and who the recipient is.</p>
<p>The process of creating a QR code is very simple.</p>
<p>The first step involves entering a crypto address in the address field.</p>
<p>The second step is for the sender to state how much the recipient should receive.</p>
<p>The sender can add a frame and change the colours of the QR Code. The purpose of this is to ensure the QR Code stands out and is more easily recognized.</p>
<p>The final step is to download the QR Code.</p>
<p>However, QR Codes can also be part of a scam activity conducted by tricksters looking to obtain details to peoples’ cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>A network of Bitcoin-to-QR-code generators stole more than $45,000 in a four-week period at the start of 2020.</p>
<p>Nine websites asked users to provide their Bitcoin addresses so that they can be converted into QR Codes.</p>
<p>But instead of converting a Bitcoin address into its own unique QR code, the websites always generated the same QR code which corresponded to the scammer’s crypto wallet.</p>

<preview>A unit of measurement for the number of bits in quantum information, and is also called a &quot;qubit.&quot;</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Quantum Bit (Qubit)?</h2>
<p>Qubit is the two-state quantum-mechanical system. A qubit can store a 0, a 1, or a superposition of those states. Qubits are the elements through which quantum computers operate. These, in general, can act as computational bits.</p>
<p>The two basic operations performed on qubits are quantum gates and measurements, which have to be applied with great care because even the slightest interference can destroy the fragile superposition state. In general, the number of qubits needed to implement a quantum computer scales exponentially with the complexity of an algorithm. This is why some problems might be intractable for classical computers but can be solved easily on a quantum computer.</p>
<p>In qubit, the spin of the electron is up and down at the same time. The measurement of this superposition state returns either up or down with equal probability. It is one of several varieties of quantum superposition states. The qubit can be used as the basis for a variety of useful quantum algorithms and has been proved to be optimal for linear optical quantum computing operations.</p>
<p>For example, in just one ten-thousandth of a second, the qubit can:</p>
<p>Test all possible passwords at once.</p>
<p>Perform an arbitrary sequence of calculations that depends on both the previous and next steps in a computation.</p>
<p>Create massive parallelism by performing calculations in different parts of space simultaneously.</p>
<p>Create a secure communication channel that cannot be hacked remotely by exploiting physical properties such as polarization, directionality, and entanglement.</p>
<p>Qubit also demonstrates the key properties of quantum computing — all its calculations are done in a non-linear fashion. It is inherently probabilistic and all its qubits are entangled with each other. These properties enable qubit to perform many powerful calculations that classical computers cannot do, such as solving difficult problems where conventional computers get stuck on local minima. </p>
<p>A bit is the basic unit of data in computing. A bit has only two possible values, usually denoted 0 and 1, representing off and on, low and high voltage levels, and so on. In classical computing, a bit can exist in only one state at a time. </p>
<p>A qubit (quantum bit) is a unit of data used in quantum computing. In a quantum computer, qubits are capable of existing in multiple states at once (superposition). Using superposition to represent information offers tremendous advantages over classical computers.</p>

<h2>What Is Quantum Computing?</h2>
<div>Quantum computing is the study of how to use phenomena in quantum physics to create new ways of computing. The basic unit of information in quantum computing is a qubit. Unlike a traditional computer bit, which is a binary digit characterized as either 0 or 1, a qubit can be a coherent superposition of both 0 and 1. The power of a quantum computer increases with each qubit that is added. However, adding more transistors will not add power linearity, as it would with traditional computers.</div>
<p>Superposition and entanglement are the two features of quantum mechanics used for quantum computations. These features empower quantum computers to handle operations at speeds that are exponentially higher as compared to traditional computers, while also consuming a lot less energy in the process. </p>
<p>A very simple definition of a quantum computer is a computer that harnesses phenomena from quantum mechanics in order to perform much more efficient computations than older, classical computer technologies are capable of.</p>
<p>The field of quantum computing originates in the 1980s, when it was discovered that certain computational problems can better be tackled using quantum algorithms than with the classical counterparts in use at the time.</p>
<p>Quantum computing could significantly contribute to the fields of finance, military affairs, artificial intelligence, big data, etc.</p>
<div>In the cryptocurrency sector, there has been some debate about how the advent of quantum computing will affect the security of networks such as Bitcoin (BTC) by posing a threat to the resilience of their cryptography. Developers and mathematicians are therefore working to investigate how it might be possible to create quantum-resistant cryptography that could future-proof these networks.</div>

<preview>A smart contract by OMG Network to solve layer-2 blockchain problems.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Quasar Smart Contract?</h2>
<div>Quasar Smart Contract is the solution to one of the biggest challenges faced by layer-2 blockchain projects; it takes around 14 days to move the asset to layer 1 from layer 2. </div>
<p>OMG Network uses its Plasma layer-2 scaling solution to get past the issue of layer-2 blockchain scalability. It enhanced its Plasma solution to transform it into Quasar.</p>
<p>Every layer-2 blockchain that uses fraud proofs faces the ‘exit period challenge.’ OMG Network also faces the problem, but its Quasar Smart Contract approach enables ‘fast exit.’</p>
<h2>The Need for Layer-2 Solutions</h2>
<p>Chains can generally have two of the three properties: scalability, decentralization, and security. Scalability is inversely proportional to decentralization for a given level of security. As a result, trade-offs must be made in a blockchain. High transaction fees and extended waiting times are a problem on Ethereum, the most popular blockchain. Some projects aim to alleviate this fundamental difficulty by processing transactions on a second layer. Plasma is one of five different actors in the umbrella of layer-2 solutions.</p>
<p>Multiple copies of the main chain run alongside each other in plasma. These subsidiary chains handle thousands of transactions before bundling them and sending them back to the parent chain as a single transaction. A child chain is a non-custodial, trustless chain in which users own their funds. They may thus go to the most recent accurate snapshots of the plasma chain to recover their tokens if there are any mistakes or exploits.</p>
<p>Plasma layers have a high throughput of over 1,000 transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of traditional technologies. There is no need that a trade must be made with a set number of known companies or persons; there is always room for flexibility. Plasma solutions are only suited for transactions and swaps and do not completely enable smart contracts. Polygon and OMG Network are two projects that utilize plasma layers.</p>

<h2>What Is a Quorum (Governance) ?</h2>
<p>A quorum is the minimum number of members of an assembly or group that must be present at any of its meetings to make the proceedings of that meeting valid. In a business context, companies will often stipulate the quorum of shareholders that are required to be present in order to make a binding decision.</p>
<p>The quorum can be as simple as a 51% majority. In other cases, some groups and firms come to more specific arrangements. There are even  guidelines that exist that companies can draw upon in order to determine the appropriate formula for their quorum.</p>
<p>To clarify, there is no definitive number, percentage or formula that universally constitutes a quorum. However, best practices suggest that a quorum is, at minimum, established as a simple majority of members within an organization. </p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, the quorum number or percentage needs to be representative of members in a decision-making role. It can be stipulated in governance or contractual documents to make it binding.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Rage-quit?</h2>
<p>Rage-quit is the process where a member of a DAO exits part or all of their stake, leaves with a proportional share of the assets in the DAO’s treasury, and quits their participation.</p>
<div>Rage-quit was first developed as a key part of the V1 Moloch DAO framework and has remained a core feature of all subsequent versions of the Moloch DAO framework. It has also since been introduced as an option within other DAO frameworks, such as Gnosis Guild’s Zodiac and 1Hive’s Dandelion Org, often under the label of “exit.”</div>
<div>In the Moloch DAO implementation, rage-quit can be invoked by any member at any time, unless the member has already voted “Yes” on an active proposal. Importantly, a member who has not voted “Yes” (i.e., they have voted “No” or have not voted at all) can rage-quit in the grace period between when that proposal has passed and when it is executed. </div>
<div>Rage-quit, therefore, ensures that all members of the DAO maintain full custody over their share of the assets in the DAO’s treasury, even while those assets are available to be collectively deployed to advance the DAO’s purpose. That same property also protects minority members from the tyranny of the majority, lowering the barrier for all individuals - wealthy and less-wealthy, alike - to pool their assets to advance shared goals.</div>
<p>A DAO that includes the Rage-quit feature attracts members who value participation in the DAO’s activities over their quittable proportion of the treasury, fostering stronger alignment among the remaining DAO members.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Raiden Network?</h2>
<div>The Raiden Network is a scaling layer built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to initiate fast and low-cost transactions. The network interacts with tokens built using Ethereum’s ERC-20 standards. In other words, it is similar to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. Raiden differs in operation from its main chain because it doesn’t require global consensus.</div>
<div>However, to preserve the integrity of transactions, Raiden powers token transfers using digital signatures and hash-locks. Referred to as balance proofs, this type of token exchange uses payment channels. These channels allow Raiden to facilitate bidirectional transfer between two participants without the intervention of the underlying blockchain.</div>
<p>Note that balance proofs on the Raiden Network are monitored by the main chain, and they act as binding contracts. Apart from bi-directional payment channels, the Raiden Network is characterized by the presence of mediated transfers and routing.</p>
<div>Mediated transfers happen when a token transfer between two participants goes through other users. This occurs when there’s no open peer-to-peer channel. Routing, on the other hand, is responsible for facilitating mediated transfers through multiple nodes.</div>
<div>Being an off-chain or layer two scaling solution for Ethereum, the Raiden Network makes it economically feasible to transfer small amounts of ERC20-based tokens. This is made possible by removing the high transaction fees incurred when directly interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.</div>
<div>Another advantage of the Raiden Network is its increased privacy compared to when sending coins on-chain. The protocol can be used to facilitate instant token swaps, micropayments, and retail payments.</div>

<h2>What Is Rank?</h2>
<div>Rank is the relative position a cryptocurrency occupies in the market. Usually, the rank of a digital currency is evaluated by its market capitalization. Market capitalization, or market cap, is calculated by multiplying the price of a cryptocurrency with its circulating supply at any given time.</div>
<p>Apart from relying solely on price and circulating supply, some ranking platforms consider an asset’s 24-hour trading volume. Since the birth of digital currency, Bitcoin has occupied position one.</p>
<div>Ethereum has largely managed to maintain as second in rank, although it was once dethroned by Ripple (XRP). XRP usually occupies the third in rank until Ripple faced security accusations with the SEC, which caused its coin to nosedive, both in market price and rank. Generally, apart from Bitcoin, the rest of the coins fluctuate in rank depending on market sentiment and price action.</div>
<div>Examples of coins that battle for the top ten positions include BTC, ETH, XRP, Tether (USDT), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), EOS (EOS), Monero (XMR) and Binance Coin (BNB). Since the rank of a cryptocurrency is largely dependent on the market capitalization, investor sentiments and industry news play a huge role.</div>
<div>Although most individuals track cryptocurrency ranks according to market cap, CoinMarketCap gives the option to adjust ranking based on price, 24-hour and seven-day price change, volume and circulating supply.</div>

<h2>What Is Ransomware?</h2>
<div>Ransomware is a type of malware used by hackers to steal or encrypt their victims’ files to extort them for a ransom in exchange for file decryption or restoration. Ransom payment may range from a few dollars to millions, usually paid in digital currencies, depending on the victim being attacked.</div>
<p>Ransomware programs can access devices or systems in numerous ways, most commonly through phishing schemes, which come via emails presented to would-be victims as trusted files. Malicious spam emails would often be booby-trapped with infected links, PDFs, or other attachments. Once activated, ransomware programs swiftly take control of a device while the attacker blackmails their target by threatening to destroy, leak, or sell the stolen data if the ransom isn’t paid in due time. </p>
<div>There are three categories of ransomware: scareware, screen lockers and encrypting ransomware.</div>
<p>Scareware programs come in the form of pop-up messages that claim to have found malware in your device and that the only way to get rid of them is by paying a certain amount of money. </p>
<p>Screen lockers are used by hackers to freeze out users from their devices. As soon as their devices are booted up, victims are met with a message from law enforcement offices (FBI, Department of Justice, etc.) stating that illegal activities have been detected on their devices or system and that a fine must be paid.</p>
<p>Encryption ransomware programs are used by hackers to encrypt a user’s files and demand them for payment before their files are decrypted. No security software or tool can ever decrypt an encrypted file or system.</p>
<div>Bitcoin appears to be the most popular form of ransom payment demanded by ransomware hackers.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Rebalancing?</h2>
<div>Rebalancing is the process of realigning the weightage of a portfolio of assets, involving buying or selling assets periodically to maintain a targeted level of asset allocation and risk. It can help investors manage downside risks while still participating in most of the upside. </div>
<p>This process is critical during moments of financial instability to help individuals mitigate the risks of loss and depreciation of their digital assets. This not only prevents overexposure but also helps to instill good trading habits by building a certain discipline to stick to a long-term financial plan that allows the regular monitoring of anypk= potential market movements that could cause losses.</p>
<p>Most rebalancing strategies are time period-based, such as yearly, quarterly or monthly. They can also be reactionary, for example, based on allowable percentage compositions of assets, which is more cost-intensive. If the original target asset allocation was 50/50 among assets A and B and asset A performed well, it could have increased the weighting of the portfolio to 70%.</p>
<p>This means that an investor may sell some of A to buy more B to return to the original target allocation of 50/50. While the split does not need to be even among assets, rebalancing is most effective with a good mix of volatile and non-volatile holdings in the portfolio, as it safeguards investors from overexposure to undesirable risks.</p>
<p>In traditional finance, rebalancing is either done manually by the investor tracking through spreadsheets and buying/selling through exchanges/brokers or investing in funds where portfolio managers handle it.</p>
<p>Rebalancing in DeFi can be more advantageous as the process can be automated via smart contracts and doesn’t require you to monitor your portfolio and cross-check the value of your assets against the stock markets constantly. This allows users to distribute their gains across their assets while allowing the portfolio to retain a net positive gain. </p>

<title>Rebase</title>

<file>rebase.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A token designed so that the circulating supply adjusts automatically according to price fluctuations.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Rebase?</h2>
<div>A rebase (or price-elastic) token is designed in a way that the circulating token supply adjusts (increases or decreases) automatically according to a token’s price fluctuations. This expansion and contraction is what we call a rebase mechanism.</div>
<div>Rebase tokens are somewhat akin to stablecoins, in the sense that they both have price targets. However, unlike stablecoins, rebase tokens’ have an elastic supply, meaning the circulating supply adjusts accordingly to supply and demand, without changing the value of the tokens in users’ wallets.</div>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<div>A rebase protocol happens routinely. For example, Ampleforth’s AMPL has a rebase scheduled every 24 hours, with a target price of $1. If its price goes above $1, the circulating supply expands during rebase, thereby reducing the value of each AMPL token. Conversely, if the price of AMPL dips below $1, the current supply contracts during rebase, thereby increasing the value of each token.</div>
<p>What happens from the users’ point of view? The amount of tokens in each wallet will increase or decrease accordingly. Yet the total value of each wallet does not change, thanks to the rebasing mechanism. </p>
<p>To elaborate, if Bob has 1 AMPL, which doubles in value to become $2, the supply will inflate during the rebase period. This means that Bob’s 1 AMPL will decrease to 0.5 AMPL, yet the value will still be $1 since 1 AMPLE would now be worth $2.</p>
<div>Other rebase tokens include YAM, RMPL and BASED.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Recovery Seed?</h2>
<div>A recovery seed is a cryptographically derived security code composed of a list of random words, typically ranging between 12 and 14, which allows anyone to access a cryptocurrency wallet on any device as long as they have the right software. This code must be safely stored and kept private to maintain the security of one’s digital asset holdings.</div>
<p>A recovery seed, which may also be referred to as a seed phrase or a backup seed phrase, can be used to retrieve control over a crypto wallet in the event of losses or damaged devices. </p>
<p>It is recommended that once a recovery seed is generated, the user should jot it down on a piece of paper and keep it close by without anyone knowing its location. Note that anyone who can access your seed phrase can have custody over your funds or outright steal them even if they don’t have your device.</p>
<p>There are other security features attached to a crypto wallet such as authentication systems that allow the owner to set a password as a secondary safety layer on top of the recovery seed. This security model requires a user to input both the recovery seed and password correctly in order to regain access to lost crypto funds. Losing any of the two would mean losing your funds, which makes it a double-edged sword.</p>
<div>A notable report that highlights the value of keeping a copy of a recovery seed is the story of Stone Man. In the report, a BitcoinTalk user shared his loss of 8,999 BTC (worth around $24 billion in today’s prices) after a single wallet file was wiped out of his drive. Unfortunately, the incident happened back in 2010 when recovery seeds were nonexistent.</div>

<title>Redundancy</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/redundancy</url>
<file>redundancy.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The term refers to something that is in excess of that required for normal operation.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Redundancy?</h2>
<p>Redundancy is a concept in which an entity has more than one piece of something. That can be anything from a piece of information to a backup system, to a repetitive explanation of something (just like what we did here). The idea behind it is that if one fails, there's another to take its place.</p>
<p>In computing, redundancy can refer to extra storage space or an extra power supply on a computer. In this sense, it makes sure the system has enough storage space and power to keep running even when something goes wrong.</p>
<div>In networks, redundancy refers to having duplicate pathways between nodes so that if one link fails, there is still at least one other path for the network traffic to travel through.</div>
<p>In communications, redundancy refers to using multiple channels or paths for data in order to improve reliability or security.</p>
<p>In datacenter design, redundancy refers to having multiple servers or systems able to take over each other's roles if one fails (for example, if you have two web servers and one goes down, the other can pick up the work).</p>
<p>While redundancy is useful in many situations, it becomes an issue as well – writers for instance. </p>
<p>In writing, redundancy is where two words, phrases, or sentences are used in the same text and have the same meaning. It makes the second part unnecessary as it doesn't add to the idea. It's also called tautology or pleonasm. A classic example of redundancy is: &quot;It was freezing cold outside.&quot; Both &quot;freezing&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; mean the same thing, hence using both the words in the same sentence became unnecessary.</p>
<h2>Built-in Redundancy Makes Blockchains Extremely Fault-tolerant</h2>
<div>Blockchain is a distributed ledger (or database) that stores immutable records of events across multiple systems in such a way that they cannot be altered. These records can be viewed by any participant in the network, but they cannot be changed. A blockchain provides a shared truth that is replicated among participants who do not fully trust one another. These attributes make it attractive for many applications that require consensus about data or transactions without relying on a trusted third party.</div>
<p>It is the redundancy of blockchains that makes them extremely fault-tolerant, although this also implies very high storage requirements. When a transaction is added to the blockchain, every node in the network receives a copy of that transaction for storage as part of the chain. This adds overhead to the system, consuming computational and storage resources within each node.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Redundancy</h2>
<p>Redundancy has been shown to reduce downtime and increase productivity. The more productive an organization is, the better it will do financially. Redundancy also helps maintain a good reputation for reliability and service in an industry. This can lead to more clients and better revenue.</p>
<p>A redundant system would need multiple processors, which in turn increase the processing capacity of a computer system. This can help improve response time for users who may be waiting for responses from computers that are overloaded or running too slow.</p>
<p>Redundancy can also help with disaster recovery efforts in the event of a server crash or other major disaster that wipes out critical data on the main computer system. If there are additional copies of files held on backup systems, then it's possible to recover lost data from those backups in such an event.</p>

<h2>What Is Regenerative Finance (ReFi)?</h2>
<p>Regenerative Finance uses money as a tool to solve some of the most challenging issues we face in the world, including combatting the natural climate and environmental crises in a way that will help benefit the Earth for future generations. </p>
<p>It is a movement towards establishing a new financial system in balance with the earth and its planetary boundaries – one where economics and ecology align.  </p>
<p>It is a new way to think about economics, looking at how we can connect financial activity in tandem with regenerating the world’s natural resources, making the environment a key stakeholder within the global economic system. </p>
<div>In crypto, regenerative finance focuses on funding community and public goods projects that will support our largest silent stakeholder: planet Earth. Increased sources of demand for carbon credits, or new use cases like real-world asset-backed stablecoins, can make it a lucrative asset while also catalyzing environmental project development. And increased demand is made possible by the tokenized carbon credits that can be integrated natively within applications for automated climate action.</div>
<p>The concept of ReFi sees money as a powerful tool to aggressively address our greatest challenge – the climate crisis. It is the idea of how to make capital flow to regenerate the Earth in a manner that is scalable, permissionless, and without middlemen.</p>

<h2>What Are Regens?</h2>
<div>Regen is a play on words on “‘degen” (short for degenerate), a popular term in crypto communities, particularly for traders interested in risky decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. </div>
<div>Regen, meanwhile, is a term used in regenerative finance (ReFi). Regenerative Finance is a different segment of DeFi that uses web3 tools, such as smart contracts, to introduce planet-positive, environment-related markets, such as carbon credits, that are focused on creating positive change in human behaviors while regenerating our planet. </div>
<p>Regen, like degen, is a term used to describe a crypto user who jumps into ReFi communities or invests in tokens that use blockchain technology to advance positive environmental impact. </p>
<p>Regens often purchase tokens that can generate yield and be plugged into other aspects of the web3 ecosystem while also helping to fund public goods that are mainly advancing the protection of the Earth. The term promotes how crypto users can leverage blockchain technology for profit and, at the same time, benefit from a secure, reliable, transparent and open financial ecosystem that is channeled towards revitalizing the Earth and combating climate and societal issues.</p>

<title>Regional/Local/Community Currencies</title>

<file>regional-local-community-currencies.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Regional, local, and community currencies are a means of exchange of goods used in specific geographical locations.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Regional/Local/Community Currencies?</h2>
<p>In economics, there are a variety of currencies that can be found in one locale. A local currency is one that is spent in a certain geographical location. A regional currency refers to a local currency utilized in a larger area, and a community currency is often used within a specific community as a means of exchange. </p>
<p>Local currencies are usually created for a variety of reasons – sometimes to encourage spending within local groups and businesses. Sometimes they are created because a community of people doesn’t trust the legal tender of their state. This distrust is a phenomenon that is not new but as old as money itself. While modern-day economics may seem to be more structured and stable, many local economies around the world, particularly around South America, are experiencing high rates of inflation that is leaving local communities seeking alternative means of exchanging goods. </p>
<p>Another common reason for using a community currency is the belief that money harms the civilized interaction of individuals because everything becomes focused on maximizing profit. This social reason encourages employment creation, promotes various local activities and small businesses, and strengthens community solidarity.</p>
<p>The way that local currencies measure value can differ – some are exchanged 1:1 for local legal tender. Others use work time as a currency and then calculate the value of each persons’ time in the same way. </p>
<p>Forgery is not a huge problem in smaller communities. Still, as the planet’s population grows, pressure on these local currencies increases when governments begin to sense competition in the monetary system. </p>
<div>Blockchain technology offers a few solutions to the challenges faced by local currencies. One solution is to automate the currency’s loss of value over time. Typically, a token is worth a fixed amount of an asset (whether that’s something tangible, working hours, etc.). </div>
<p>However, many regional currencies want their units to slowly lose value over time so that nobody starts hoarding them. The blockchain infrastructure separates documentation from tokenization and allows you to introduce a gradual loss of value natively to the tokens, for example, one percent per day or month. This separation is a simple technological solution and works perfectly in an all-digital community.</p>

<title>Regulated</title>

<file>regulated.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Regulation is when something is controlled by a specific set of rules.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Does Regulated Mean?</h2>
<p>Regulated means that a specific thing, such as an exchange, or a currency is controlled or maintained so that it operates properly. In the world of cryptocurrencies, the currency in question is only regulated if the sale constitutes the sale of a security under state or federal law, or is considered money transmission under state law or conduct. In other words, regulation means that something is controlled, by making it work in a specific way or through following pre-set rules. </p>
<p>In regard to cryptocurrencies, you have probably heard the term regulated market or controlled market. This means that it is a market that is essentially an idealized system where the government or other organizations oversee the market itself and control the forces in terms of supply as well as demand. They can even regulate the market actions if applicable. </p>
<p>That being said, this does come with its own benefits, and a variety of forms of regulation can be found in a regulated market. These include controls, oversights, environmental protection, taxation and anti-discrimination.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that regulation can change over time due to the various technological advancements as well as a change in attitude towards a specific regulation in general. </p>
<p>This practice of regulated markets has its origin all the way back to when ancient societies relied on standardized weights as well as measurements and even practiced punishment when theft or fraud occurred — quite fascinating.</p>
<p>Another way we can define the market is as a multilateral system that is operated as well as managed by a market operator, and intended to bring together or facilitate the binding together of a multitude of third-party buying. This is of course alongside the process of selling interests in financial instruments. In this system, as well as in accordance with its rules, it can result in a contract and in respect of the financial instruments that were admitted to trading under its rules or systems.</p>

<title>Regulatory Compliance</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/regulatory-compliance</url>
<file>regulatory-compliance.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Regulatory compliance is a set of mandates that every company or industry is required to follow to track accountability at work.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Regulatory Compliance?</h2>
<p>Regulatory compliance is the efforts made by companies to implement and follow all applicable laws, regulations, and rules.</p>
<p>When it comes to a company's operations, it must follow a set of rules and regulations. These rules are developed by state, federal, or international institutions, and the requirements may differ depending on the industry or type of business. When a company operates according to these mandates, it is essentially following regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Adherence to external legal mandates issued by state, federal, or international governments can be considered regulatory compliance. Furthermore, following company policies and procedures entails following the company's internal regulations. Both, nevertheless, contribute to increased workplace accountability.</p>
<div>In the year 2009, blockchain emerged as a revolutionary technology in the world. However, its application and potential extend beyond cryptocurrencies. Blockchain operates on a simple framework that consists of a distributed ledger that runs concurrently on millions of nodes distributed across geography, organizations, and individuals. What distinguishes blockchain is its cryptographically guaranteed data integrity and irreversibility.</div>
<p>For example, once ledger transactions are pooled into blocks and recorded to the database, they are followed by cryptographic authentication which makes it nearly impossible to change any part of the ledger illicitly.</p>
<div>This is one of the most impressive aspects of blockchain from the standpoint of compliance because it is practically immutable: once data is saved into the chain, it cannot be changed or deleted. As a result, blockchain is used as a document or proof of transfer for any digital asset, such as bitcoins or other digital currencies.</div>
<p>The immutability of blockchain can also be used in the proof-of-process for compliance. Blockchain technology can be used to record the steps required by regulatory requirements. The immutable recording of actions and their outputs can create an audit log for regulatory authorities to ensure adherence.</p>
<div>KYC (know your customer) and anti-money laundering policies are a part of regulatory compliance, and blockchain can play a key role. Banks and other financial institutions must complete several tasks and steps to accept new clients. There are important rules to follow regarding confirmation and verification, in addition to data collection. In some cases, the process can take several months. Many of the steps could be skipped if the data was already in a secure, tamper-proof database – an incorruptible blockchain.</div>
<p>Blockchain technology has the potential to improve private regulatory compliance, and it can also assist regulatory agencies. </p>
<p>Agencies can maintain near-real-time access to secure compliance-related data stored on regulated financial organizations' blockchains. Rather than analyzing information after the fact, this would allow regulators to continuously improve.</p>
<p>In conclusion, regulatory compliance is a protocol that every field must follow. But with the help of technology, these regulatory processes, such as KYC and financial crime prevention, maybe early converts among the many processes that could be improved and made efficient. All industries can reap enormous benefits.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Rehypothecation?</h2>
<p>Rehypothecation is the practice where banks, and even the brokers themselves, use assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients for their own purposes. Clients that permit rehypothecation of their collateral can be compensated through a lower cost of borrowing or a rebate on fees.</p>
<p>Rehypothecation occurs when the lender ends up using its rights to the collateral in order to participate in their own transactions, with the hopes of eventual financial benefits.</p>
<p>Rehypothecation occurs when a borrower promises the right to an asset, as a form of collateral, in exchange for funds. Rehypothecation was a common practice all the way until the year 2007, where hedge funds became warier about it.</p>
<p>Rehypothecation takes place if a customer leaves a number of securities with a broker as a deposit, in a margin account, where the broker can then use the securities as a pledge for the margin on his own margin account or as backing for a loan.</p>
<p>In this instance, you have hypothecation, which occurs when a borrower promises the right to an asset as a form of collateral in exchange for funds.</p>
<p>A common example of this occurs in the primary housing market, where a borrower can use the home he or she is purchasing as collateral for a mortgage loan.</p>
<p>Now, even though the borrower asserts a level of ownership over the property, the lender has the ability to actually seize the asset if payments are not made as required.</p>

<preview>Rehypothecation is a process where brokers use the assets collateralized by clients for their own benefit.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Rehypothecation?</h2>
<div>Rehypothecation is a way of generating credit from assets and allowing multiple financial transactions to be collateralized by the same asset. To understand rehypothecation, one must understand what hypothecation is. </div>
<div>Hypothecation is the process of pledging assets as collateral for a debt. This is a common practice in lending. In the case of rehypothecation, it is a process of using hypothecated collateral as an asset in itself and offering that as collateral when seeking a loan.</div>
<div>An example of rehypothecation is of securities that have been posted with a prime brokerage as collateral by a hedge fund. The brokerage can then use its conditional right to those hypothecated securities as an asset to hypothecate its own loan applications.</div>
<div>Rehypothecation is utilized in situations where the broker-custodian has loaned the principal money to purchase the assets in the first place. It helps to create liquidity for individual market participants and across the market, increasing access to capital for businesses and delivering social benefits.</div>
<p>In the digital economy, rehypothecation has been said to destabilize the crypto space, suppress BTC prices and reduce the efficacy of blockchain security by taking claims to ownership off-chain that have not materialized. Bitcoin has more than tripled in value since 2018, suggesting price-suppression effects have been minimal.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A shorthand slang for “wrecked,” describing a bad loss in a trade.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is REKT?</h2>
<p>REKT (or rekt) is an internet slang for “wrecked,” meaning severely damaged or utterly destroyed and ruined. However, depending on the context, it may mean something else.</p>
<div>In the crypto community, rekt often refers to someone who has experienced a heavy financial loss due to a wrong trade or investment. For instance, let’s say Bob invests more than half his savings on XRP just after its price soared. And a week later, the price of XRP nosedived to less than 20% of the previous week’s value due problems with regulation. In this case, Bob has gotten REKT.</div>
<p>In addition, the word REKT can also refer to a digital asset itself that loses value. In the above example with Bob, one could appropriately say XRP got rekt.</p>
<div>It needs to be noted that being REKT and truly losing money are different things, since rekt assets can still bounce back. Back in early 2018, BTC was rekt, yet near the end of 2020, not only did it bounce back, but it also reached a new all-time high.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A form of technical analysis that serves as a momentum oscillator, measuring the speed and change of price movements.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Relative Strength Index (RSI)?</h2>
<p>Relative Strength Index (RSI) refers to an indicator derived from the price momentum of any particular asset. The main factors for the computation of the RSI are the asset’s change in price and the speed with which it happens. Those movements, especially since they can strongly shift from two extremes, are considered oscillations. RSI oscillations are rated between 0-100.</p>
<div>The importance of determining the RSI of a particular asset is to check whether it is either overbought or oversold. Typically, an RSI indicator that reflects more than 70 is considered overbought. When it is oversold, RSI can reflect figures lower than 30. This is used as a signal by traders to identify the trend of an asset’s price, divergences and potential swings.</div>
<p>As already mentioned, RSI is also important for traders trying to identify potential trend reversals and support and resistance levels. This helps traders perform a more comprehensive technical analysis. RSI is applied in determining whether the market is exhibiting either a bearish or bullish divergence.</p>
<p>In a bullish divergence, the RSI gets higher while an asset’s price continues to drop. This reflects that there are more people buying the asset despite the price decreasing.</p>
<p>In a bearish divergence, the price of an asset rises while the RSI drops lower. This reflects that the asset’s price increase is beginning to lose upwards momentum.</p>
<p>The RSI is measured based on the change of an asset’s price between 14 periods, which can either be on a daily or hourly chart basis. To calculate the RSI, the average gain of an asset within the period and its average loss is divided and plotted on the zero to 100 scale.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Relay Chain?</h2>
<p>The Relay Chain is the central chain that is used by the Polkadot network. Polkadot is a heterogeneous multi-chain and translation architecture that allows specialized blockchains and public blockchains to connect within a unified network.</p>
<p>The Relay Chain has deliberately minimal functionality, so, for example, smart contracts are not supported. The main task here is to coordinate the overall system and its connected parachains – the term for the  various individual layer 1 blockchains that run in parallel on the network.</p>
<div>All of the validators of Polkadot stake the network’s native DOT tokens and validate the Relay Chain. The architecture allows for a number of transaction types that allow validators to interact with governance mechanisms, parachain auctions, and nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS). </div>
<p>Polkadot can support a number of execution slots, which are like scores on a CPU. Each of these can run one process at a time. Polkadot facilitates these slots using two subscription models:  parachains and parathreads. Parachains have a dedicated slot for their chain and are a process that runs constantly. Parathreads share slots among a group and are processes that only need to be called upon occasionally. As a result, they run a lot less frequently.</p>
<p>This being the case, most of the computation that occurs across the Polkadot network will be delegated to a specific parachain or parathread implementation, which can handle a particular use case. Polkadot places no constraints over what parachains are able to do besides the fact they must be able to generate a proof that can be validated by the validators that are assigned to the parachain.</p>

<preview>Relay nodes help block-producing nodes communicate by guaranteeing that the authenticity of the core nodes and the blockchain is preserved, even if one or more relays are hacked.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Relay Nodes?</h2>
<div>Relay nodes act as network hubs, connecting to a large number of other nodes. These have high-performance connectivity, allowing for a strong communication path. As a result, They reduce the number of hops and require time to send a message across the network.</div>
<div>In a blockchain, a node is a computer and is responsible for allowing parties to participate in the decentralized database. Multiple nodes spread across various locations run the network in a decentralized manner. They are the foundation of blockchain technology. A and their interactions within the blockchain's infrastructure help in the creation of a unified system within the blockchain. As a result, when there are more nodes supporting the decentralized infrastructure, the blockchain becomes more resilient. </div>
<div>Relay nodes are a type of node in the blockchain network that can reduce system noise by collecting protocol messages from participating nodes as well as other relay nodes that are connected to them. They perform duplication checks, validate signatures and other steps, and then transmit only valid messages. To reduce propagation time, relay nodes are frequently located near internet exchange points. They can be operated by anyone.</div>
<div>Relay nodes are commonly used in wireless networks in the domain of information technology. They can significantly boost the efficiency of a wireless network and can be deliberately arranged to split a long single-hop into shorter time (two) hops rather than performing a single long hop from one node to the other. Although the effectiveness of this technique varies depending on the technology, path loss models, and environment, it has been shown in some cases to be extremely effective at reducing path loss.</div>
<div>In the case of the Algorand platform, relay nodes are primarily used to aid the maintenance of interconnection between all the other node types. They communicate with participation nodes and other relay nodes using messages on the network, which are then used to perform deduplication, signature checks, and other validation checks in order to re-promote valid messages on the system. They significantly reduce transmission time.</div>
<div>A relay node installs the same software as a non-relay node, but only necessitates a few additional configuration specifications to be set.</div>
<div>The fact that a relay node is effectively the same as any other node is one of the advantages of Algorand's decentralized network implementation. Currently, the distinction is made by configuring a node to actively listen for connections from others and advertising itself via DNS SRV records. A relay for a personal network that does not require DNS entries can be set up. A node is a valid relay node if both of the following conditions are met:</div>
<div>Other nodes link to relay nodes. As a result, it must be capable of supporting a large number of connections while also handling the processing burden associated with all of the data traveling to and from these connections. </div>

<p>In the world of blockchain, renewable energy has garnered a lot of attention. No matter how we look at it, there is a global issue that needs to be solved, and that is the substantial amount of energy consumed in cryptocurrency mining. </p>
<div>Blockchains is a distributed ledger that verifies, validates, and records transactions. They are public and free from a central authority and rely on mining via consensus protocols such as the Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithms.</div>
<div>Proof of Work is primarily intended to stimulate real-world resource mining in a digital setting using complex equations. To update and verify the network, computers operate in a computational race to solve a transaction code. Every 10 minutes, a new block is created. As a result, cryptocurrency is said to be mined by miners, which are essentially specialized computers.</div>
<p>There are over 1 million BTC miners worldwide, as well as millions of miners processing transactions for other Proof of Stake crypto networks, such as Litecoin and ETH. All of this crypto mining consumes a lot of energy, which has people all over the world concerned about its impact on the environment.</p>
<p>According to the University of Cambridge, BTC's energy consumption could range between 40 and 440 terawatts.</p>
<div>The rise of renewable energy has been accelerated by cryptocurrency mining. This is because miners go where the power is the cheapest. After all, cheaper power equals higher profits. </div>
<p>Several startups are currently researching and inventing ideas for developing alternative energy sources and recycling mining energy. Examples include Nasty Mining, which uses solar and wind energy; Swiss Alps Mining, which is constructing special hydropower plants and reusing mining energy, and many other similar projects.</p>
<p>The most significant benefit of renewable energy is its nearly limitless availability. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric, are excellent examples that can aid miners in their efforts. Another advantage is that it helps in preserving the environment.</p>
<p>Environmental concerns are the most serious criticism leveled at Bitcoin mining. CO2e, or carbon dioxide equivalent, is an excellent indicator for comparing the environmental impact of various energy sources because it is the carbon dioxide emissions for generating electricity per kilowatt-hour.</p>
<p>To generate 1 kWh of electricity, natural gas emits between 250 and 1000 grams of CO2. Wind energy, on the other hand, emits only about 9-18 grams of CO2e over its entire life cycle.</p>
<p>Elon Musk shocked the world when he announced that he would no longer accept Bitcoin payments for Tesla vehicles, citing the harmful impact of the environmental deterioration caused by the mining.</p>
<p>Also, renewable energy sources are not prone to sharp price fluctuations because their supply is not limited. Furthermore, the price of natural energy sources has steadily decreased over time, despite the world's ever-increasing volume of production and wider adoption in various industries. As a result, the entire renewable energy industry has gained efficiency, increased production capacity, and achieved economies of scale over time.</p>
<div>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), solar energy is currently the cheapest source of energy when compared to coal and gas, which are still used by many countries. </div>
<p>As a result, the cryptocurrency mining industry can also benefit quickly from these renewable energy factors, as it will create a significant positive mood.</p>

<h2>What Are Repair Miners?</h2>
<p>Repair miners are a proposed type of mining node within the Filecoin network. They are distinct from two other types of miners: storage miners and retrieval miners. Note that repair miners are a feature of the Filecoin network that has not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>Filecoin’s developers have defined repair nodes as a type of node that facilitates “network self-healing.” To understand this, we can consider the structure of Filecoin, a decentralized system for data storage, and some aspects of the network’s operations.</p>
<p>In the Filecoin network, data is stored in sectors, which are each of a fixed size. Storage miners fill these sectors with data that is stored on behalf of their clients, who contract the storage miners’ services for a particular period of time. These contracts between storage miners and their clients are referred to as deals. Repair miners are envisioned as a third actor that could ultimately intercede in the case of an unreliable storage miner and help address the risks posed by this.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Replay Attack?</h2>
<div>Replay attacks are network security attacks where a malicious actor intercepts the communication between a sender and receiver. Replay attackers either delay the transmission of a message or transmit it as their own. Even with high-grade encryption, these attacks can still be successful since hackers are not required to decipher the message contained in order to be successful in their breach.</div>
<p>Replay attacks are utilized to trick people in a particular transaction to do what the hacker wants. By delaying the important message needed before a transaction gets finalized, they can ask the supposed receiver or sender to give them money or access to confidential information first before they decide to let the message pass through. Hackers can also intercept communication and pretend to be the actual sender to either penetrate security and authentication protocols or deceive other network participants.</p>
<p>These attacks are also sometimes called man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because they involve hackers tapping into private and encrypted communication lines. </p>
<div>An effective way to prevent falling victim to such attacks is to establish more identifiers in a particular transaction. For example, apart from digital signatures attached to a message, the communicating parties could also link time codes in order to ensure the authenticity and verifiability of any exchange. Another security barrier can be to implement the requirement of one-time passwords for each transaction request in order to establish another authentication layer.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Replicated Ledger?</h2>
<div>A replicated ledger refers to a duplicate of a blockchain’s records. In this system, ledgers are categorized as a master and slave copy. Master ledgers contain authoritative copies of blockchain information, while slave ledgers are mere replications of the master copy.</div>
<div>The idea behind the replicated ledger is to mitigate the risks in sharing only a single copy of the blockchain ledger to all network participants. Replicated ledgers do not have a single point of failure, because thr source blockchain will be replicated more than once. Also, every time a user adds new transactions to their own respective ledgers, the changes are spread throughout the network and distributed to everyone.</div>
<p>In such a system, no single authority can take over the control of the network through the ledger because all participants bear a genuine copy of it, including every other update that they put in them.</p>
<p>The data in replicated ledgers contains the exact same pieces of information stored in the blocks of the original ledger. The data within them cannot be changed as well. </p>
<div>The system is also complemented through a consensus protocol. The purpose of such a consensus protocol is to ensure that each copy of the blockchain is similar to the rest. Altered copies from previously replicated ledgers will be rejected.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Resistance?</h2>
<p>Resistance refers to the highest price level of an asset during a specific period. This is observed when the price of the asset rises to the level of resistance and triggers traders to start selling. Usually, the selling pressure amongst traders at the resistance level causes the asset’s rising price level to halt and drop further.</p>
<p>A resistance line or level does not refer to the exact highest price of an asset. Instead, it reflects specific price zones that could trigger selling action. This is important, especially in performing technical analysis, because it signals the best time to buy or sell a particular asset based on its price breakout or trend reversal. For traders, it could also help them find the ideal entry and exit points whenever they plan to take trading positions.</p>
<p>A resistance level can also change constantly based on an asset’s price changes. But aside from price, a specific set of moving averages is also an indicator that traders utilize in plotting the resistance level.</p>
<p>To determine the resistance of an asset, you can simply draw the line on its daily price chart, connecting its recent peaks. This will show how the asset reversed its trend each time the level of resistance is reached. If the price has approached the specific price zone multiple times before, it indicates the strength of resistance.</p>

<h2>What Is Retargeting?</h2>
<div>A retargeting algorithm, also referred to as a difficulty adjustment algorithm, is used on proof-of-work blockchains, such as Bitcoin. </div>
<div>Each block on PoW blockchains is created by a miner solving a complex set of equations or puzzles, however, the puzzles get harder and harder to solve after each block. The puzzle is solved by miners varying a nonce (number only used once) that produces a hash value that is lower than the hash target, which is a predefined condition of each block. </div>
<p>Each miner competes with the others to be the first one to solve the puzzle. The first one to solve it will receive a reward of Bitcoin and after the majority of miners reach a consensus, the block will be validated and added to the blockchain.</p>
<div>In order to define the block’s hash value and validate the transaction, miners must use the SHA-256 hashing function until the value is less than the target. If not, they need to keep modifying the nonce and repeat the SHA-256 hashing function until it is. </div>
<p>However, this predefined target is adjusted every 2016 blocks, approximately every 14 days, and is called “retargeting.” Retargeting ensures that the average time it takes to generate a block, 10 minutes, is maintained by increasing the difficulty of the puzzle. </p>
<div>Retargeting is generated by dividing the hash target of the first block by the hash target of the current block. This constant retargeting on PoW blockchains means that more computing power is required by miners today than when Bitcoin was created in 2009.</div>

<title>Revenue Participation Tokens</title>

<file>revenue-participation-tokens.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Revenue participation tokens are a two token system that uses one participation token and one payout token.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Revenue Participation Tokens?</h2>
<p>The whole point of investing is to productively save or grow wealth over time. In the private sector, investing is predominantly cash-based, typically done with a small part of one’s savings, either in the stock market or in precious metals like gold. </p>
<p>Today, holding cash means constantly losing money, either through inflation, which is currently growing in both developed and emerging markets, or thanks to the negative interest rates that have been the policy for much of Europe and North America. Because cash is unlikely to appreciate in value anytime soon, investing in the stock market, or in riskier assets, is one of the only viable options for longer-term growth. </p>
<p>But the stock market is a guessing game, impossible to predict, and easy to play wrong. Blockchain technology has been offering savvy investors alternatives for several years now, often in the form of cryptocurrencies. But it also creates a third option for a hedge in the form of tokenization. </p>
<p>One such use of this technology for investing would be in the form of revenue-share tokens, where companies could tokenize the ownership rights to percentages of their future profits and sell those tokens to investors to raise immediate liquidity. But there is a problem with this. </p>
<p>Tokenizing the ownership of an asset (or in this case its revenue) currently lacks the proper legal framework necessary in most jurisdictions. Additionally, owning a fraction of an asset comes with certain obstacles to the rights and obligations of the token holder.</p>
<div>An alternative to directly tokenizing revenue, and all the potential problems it can incur, is the revenue participation model, which is a two token system based on the well-established legal model usufruct that uses one participation token and one payout token.  </div>
<p>Companies with stable income (or at least in a stable industry) tokenize percentages of their future profits. They sell these tokens to investors who can then choose to either hold on to the token and eventually redeem it for that percentage of revenue, or sell the token on. This participation token acts a bit like a gift-card or IOU that grants the owner the right to a certain amount of value at a given company. </p>
<p>When the time comes for that revenue percentage to be paid out, they are dispersed in the form of a second payout token which can be redeemed for fiat or cryptocurrency, or, again, sold on an exchange. This gives both companies and investors significantly more flexibility than a traditional equity/dividends system.</p>
<p>By purchasing a revenue-participation token from a stable and reliable industry, say an agribusiness for example (cattle, soybeans, corn, etc), you can be relatively confident in a predictable return on your investment. While it may not be a gold mine in terms of dividends, it is an un-speculative and safe investment that can act as a hedge against inflation or negative interest rates, with multiple options to exit, all while supporting meaningful companies.</p>

<h2>What Are RingCT (Confidential Transactions)?</h2>
<div>Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), just as with regular confidential transactions, hide the amount of each transaction. RingCT is how transaction amounts are hidden in Monero: unlike confidential transactions, RingCT will also make the transaction amount hidden.</div>
<p>These confidential transactions can include cryptographic proof that the sum of the input amounts is the same as the sum of the output amount, without actually revealing the numbers themselves.</p>
<p>This means that you are still able to trade which address sent and received cryptocurrency.  </p>
<p>RingCT manage to protect the privacy of more than just the transaction amounts, however. For example, Monero transactions are untraceable due to ring signatures and the destination of funds is obscured thanks to stealth addresses.</p>
<p>RingCT was implemented in block #1220516 in January 2017, and after September of the same year, this feature ended up becoming mandatory throughout all of the transactions which were conducted on the network itself.</p>
<p>RingCT introduces an improved version of ring signatures known as a multi-layered linkable spontaneous anonymous group signature, which allows for hidden amounts, origins as well as destinations of transactions with a high level of efficiency and is a verifiable as well as trustless coin generation method.</p>

<preview>Ring miners are network participants in the Loopring protocol who manage order rings and ensure trades are completed for all parties involved.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Ring Miners?</h2>
<div>Loopring is an Ethereum-based exchange and payment protocol that implements a novel consensus mechanism. To avoid traditional order books and the AMM mechanisms that govern liquidity pools, Loopring employs network participants known as ring miners. </div>
<div>Ring miners facilitate orders by filling them before they can be completed or canceled. Those who work as ring miners are paid a service fee in the form of LRC tokens which is Loopring protocol's native token or a slip-margin from an order amount.</div>
<div>Ring-Miners are critical components of the Loopring network. Their activities revolve around executing orders with the help of order rings to gain a service fee. There are two types of rewards that ring-miner receive:</div>
<div>The first is the fees in the form of the Loopring (LRC) token generated by the platform. Under this case, the user who creates an order specifies the maximum number of LRC tokens to be rewarded to the ring-miner as a service fee.</div>
<div>Ring miners are also awarded through split margins, which are deducted from the total amount of a specific order. While placing an order, the user can also specify the portion of the margin that can be claimed for a specific order. </div>
<p>The decision of choosing between fees and margins is up to the ring-miners.</p>
<div>The compensation system in Loopring is intended to help ring miners receive adequate financial reward for the services they deliver during the order ring. It is based on an incentive system so that miners seek out the best exchange rate deals to obtain better split margins or service fees for themselves. Finding the perfect trading deals also ensures that users receive the most value for their traded cryptos, making it a promising win-win situation for both parties involved.</div>
<p>The Loopring smart contract defines how to fill an ordered ring when a ring miner completes it.</p>
<div>If the smart contract can execute the order on either side of the trade, it will perform a direct transfer from the smart contract to the user's wallet. Order rings also make ring-matching possible. Ring-matching completes orders by linking them together and securing multiple trades through multiple users. Order rings distinguish Loopring from other DEXs such as Waves or Bancor.</div>
<div>Let us make an imaginary order to better showcase these practices in action. Karen, Mark, and Dane are all interested in making a trade on the Loopring network. Karen wishes to exchange 2 HNT for 10 ADA, Mark wishes to exchange 21 VET for 1.5 OMG HNT, and Dane wishes to exchange 20 ADA for 40 VET. Ring miners would use ring-matching to combine these dislocated orders into a single order ring, in which Karen would trade her HNT with Mark, Mark would trade his VET with Dane, and Dane would trade his ADA with Karen. Everyone receives their desired coins after this ring order is approved by Loopring's smart contracts.</div>
<div>Except for Mark's, no one's order is filled. Loopring's order sharing would handle the leftovers, which would then be filtered into another order ring until each incomplete order is added up to the complete order.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Ring Signature?</h2>
<div>Ring signatures are a cryptographic tool that help to deliver anonymity to users. This technology is used by privacy coins such as Monero — making it difficult for outsiders to deduce the sender and recipient in a transaction.</div>
<p>Let’s imagine that Tracy wants to send 50 XMR to Nicky. She would be given a one-time spend key. To ensure that her identity can withheld, a number of people involved in past transactions would be selected at random in order to serve as decoys. This means that, to a casual observer, it would be possible that any single one of them could be involved.</p>
<p>In future, Tracy’s public key may end up being used to serve as a decoy in other ring signatures.</p>
<div>Over recent years, several government agencies have expressed concern about Monero and similar digital assets, amid concerns that these altcoins could be used for tax evasion, money laundering, or to finance terrorism.</div>
<p>Indeed, the US has made a concerted effort to crack Monero’s systems in order to ensure that the true participant in a ring signature can be identified. The IRS has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an attempt to find a workaround.</p>

<h2>What Is a Roadmap?</h2>
<p>When discussing a roadmap, you are referring to a strategic plan which defines the goal or desired outcome and includes the major steps or milestones that are required for said goal to be reached. A roadmap also serves as a communication tool, a high-level document which helps keep track of the articulated strategic thinking behind the goal as well as the plan to get there.</p>
<p>A roadmap is a high-level visual summary that helps map out the vision as well as the direction of a specific product offering throughout a pre-specified time period. This roadmap communicates the why as well as the what behind what you are building, and it is a guiding strategic document as well as a plan for executing the product strategy.</p>
<p>A roadmap has several goals, including describing vision and strategy, providing a guiding document for executing the strategy, getting internal stakeholders in alignment, facilitating  discussion as well as options and scenario planning and helping communicate with the external stakeholders, including the customers.</p>
<p>Your roadmap needs to essentially convey the strategic direction for your specific product and it also needs to tie back to the strategy for the company. The general order of what you will be building will need to be described. Furthermore, articulating the product vision, as well as the strategy, can make it a lot easier to secure executive buy-in and ensures that everyone is working towards a common goal.</p>
<p>This means that a roadmap will essentially include the themes, the epics, the stories and the features. </p>
<p>If you decide to build a roadmap down the line, you should be asking yourself a few main questions, including why you are building the product, what you are hoping to accomplish, and how it will help users.</p>

<description>
<p>Adding to the list of controversial influencers surrounding Bitcoin, Roger Keith Ver has had an interesting past. Ver’s reputation as one of the biggest advocates of all time earned him the self-proclaimed title of “Bitcoin Jesus.” Born in Silicon Valley in relatively normal circumstances, Roger had his first run-in with the law after selling explosives through eBay. After serving ten months in prison, he moved to Japan and later gained citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis (Eastern Caribbean Islands).</p>
<p>Roger Ver was an early Bitcoin investor in 2011, and he has since used his wealth to fund various crypto startups like blockchain.com, Ripple and Kraken. He also served as the CEO of Bitcoin.com until 2019, when he transitioned to the executive chairman role. He has become a huge proponent of Bitcoin Cash — enough so that Fortune Magazine made an error in 2020 by titling him as co-founder of the project.</p>
<p>Like many in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space, Ver supports and believes in individual freedoms and libertarian ideals. He has so far donated at least $3 million in Bitcoin to the Foundation for Economic Education, a libertarian think tank. Roger continues to be a force of nature in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and much more remains to be seen from his story. This quote from Roger Ver’s website summarizes his beliefs and advocacy well:</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is ROI?</h2>
<div>ROI is a metric used by cryptocurrency traders to measure the performance and the efficacy of a crypto investment, or to compare the performance of multiple crypto investments in a portfolio.</div>
<p>It is important for cryptocurrency traders to stay abreast of the ROI figure and tweak their cryptocurrency portfolios accordingly.</p>
<p>A positive ROI figure means the crypto investment is making profits meanwhile a negative ROI value reflects a loss-making venture.</p>
<p>Investors looking to invest in a crypto project through a token sale may ask to see the ROI or the projected ROI.</p>
<p>ROI is calculated by subtracting the initial value of the investment from the present value of the investment and then dividing this amount by the initial value of the investment.</p>
<p>The formula is:</p>
<p>ROI = (Present Value of Investment - Initial value of investment) / Initial Value of Investment</p>
<p>The rate of return is then calculated by multiplying the ROI by 100.</p>
<p>There are some limitations associated with using ROI to evaluate cryptocurrency profitability.</p>
<p>ROI does not account for the time period. A trader looking to sell cryptocurrency may have to wait for a much longer period than another crypto trader looking to sell. In this case, the ROI of the former trader may be less profitable, but the ROI figure does not reflect this.</p>
<p>A higher ROI can be achieved by increasing profits and reducing expenses. While this may inflate the ROI figure, it may lead to higher expenses and cause performance issues for the crypto project further down the line.</p>
<p>In summary, ROI is a useful barometer of cryptocurrency success, but it should be used alongside other factors when evaluating the success of crypto assets.</p>

<preview>Roth IRAs are generally the best investment option when you think your taxes will be higher in retirement than they are now.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Roth IRA?</h2>
<p>Roth IRAs are similar to traditional IRAs, so let's cover them first. </p>
<p>Traditional IRAs are individual retirement accounts that allow individuals to contribute pre-tax dollars to a retirement account where the investments grow tax-deferred until they are withdrawn throughout the retirement. Upon retirement, the withdrawals are taxed at the IRA owner's current income tax rate. The main difference in a Roth IRA is in the way it is taxed.</p>
<p>You see, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, and the contributions are not tax-deductible. Once you start withdrawing the funds, however, the money is tax-free. Traditional IRA deposits are made with pre-tax dollars, and you typically get a tax education on your contribution and end up paying income tax when you withdraw the money from the account throughout retirement. </p>
<p>Roth IRAs are generally the best investment option when you think your taxes will be higher in retirement than they are now, and you cannot really contribute to a Roth IRA if you make a lot of money. The limit for singles in 2021 is $140,000 while for married couples the limit is $208,000. Keep in mind that the amount you can contribute changes periodically, and in 2021, the contribution limit is $6,000 a year unless you are 50 or older, where it goes up to $7,000. All brokerage firms, physical or online can offer a Roth IRA, and most banks and investment companies will also give you as an option as well.</p>

<preview>A rug pull is a type of scam where developers abandon a project and take their investors' money.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Rug Pull?</h2>
<div>A rug pull is a malicious maneuver in the cryptocurrency industry where crypto developers abandon a project and run away with investors’ funds. Rug pulls usually happen in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, especially on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where malicious individuals create a token and list it on a DEX, then pair it with a leading cryptocurrency like Ethereum. </div>
<div>Once a significant amount of unsuspecting investors swap their ETH for the listed token, the creators then withdraw everything from the liquidity pool, driving the coin's price to zero. The coin’s creators may even create a temporary hype around Telegram, Twitter, and other social media platforms and initially inject a substantial amount of liquidity into their pool to cultivate investor confidence.</div>
<div>Rug pulls thrive on DEXs because these types of exchanges allow users to list tokens for free and without audit, unlike in centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Furthermore, creating tokens on open source blockchain protocols like Ethereum is easy and free. Malicious actors use these two factors to their advantage. </div>
<div>Note that decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap algorithmically determine the prices of tokens in a pool depending on the available balances. To ensure you don’t fall victim to a rug pull, check the liquidity in a pool. However, this is only the first step. You must also check if there is a lock on the token’s pool. Most reputable projects lock pooled liquidity for a certain period.</div>
<p>Another major characteristic of a possible rug pull is a coin skyrocketing in price within hours. For example, a rug pull coin can move from 0 to 50X within 24 hours. This trick is meant to drive FOMO that leads more people to invest in the token.</p>
<p>In order for a project to be deemed &quot;unruggable,&quot; it means that there aren't a significant amount of tokens help by the development team. Without the signature large amount of team-held tokens that could be taken in a rug pull or exit scam, a project could be considered unruggable.</p>
<p>Another way to think about an unruggable project is if the team renounces ownership of any tokens, like tokens they would have acquired during a presale.</p>

<p>The programming language was designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, but it also had contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich as well as other people throughout its development cycle. This language ended up being refined while writing the Servo layout or browser engine as well as the Rust compiler.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, it has gained a lot of use within the industry, with companies such as Microsoft experimenting with it in order to secure safety-critical software components.</p>
<p>Rust has a reputation for being one of the most beloved languages since 2016.</p>
<p>Rust has an entire ecosystem built around it. In fact, aside from the compiler, it features many aspects when it comes to creating as well as maintaining production-quality software. Multiple concurrent Rust toolchains can be installed as well as managed through &quot;rustup&quot; and the Rust installations come with Cargo, which is a command-line tool used to manage dependencies, rust nets, generate documentation and a lot more.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Ryuk Ransomware?</h2>
<p>Ryuk ransomware is a ransomware attack. The Ryuk ransomware variant was originally discovered in August 2018 and since then it has managed to grow in visibility in order to become one of the most known as well as costliest ransomware variants of our time. This is due to the fact that, unlike early variations such as WannaCry, Ryuk is designed to be targeted. The design of this malware means that each of the victims has to receive the individual attention of the cybercriminals operating the malware. Ryuk is used in many targeted campaigns that have highly tailored infection vectors as well as high ransom demands. </p>
<p>Discussing Ryuk even further, the ransomware focuses on quality over quantity when it comes to picking out its victims. A Ryuk infection starts with a targeted attack to infect an intended victim, which follows file encryption as well as an extremely large ransom demand by the Ryuk ransomware.</p>
<p>When we discuss targeted means, these include the use of tailored spear-phishing emails as well as the exploitation of compromised credentials that are used to remotely access systems through a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). </p>
<p>A spear phishing email can carry Ryuk directly or be one of the first in a series of infections. Ryuk then uses a combination of encryption algorithms, such as an asymmetric algorithm known as AES-256 as well as an asymmetric algorithm known as RSA 4096. This means that Ryuk essentially encrypts a file with the symmetric algorithm and includes a copy of the symmetric encryption key encrypted with the RSA public key. When the victim pays for the ransom, the Ryuk operator will provide a copy of the corresponding RSA private key, which enables decryption for the symmetric encryption key where it is used on the encrypted files.</p>

<preview>The Standard and Poor's 500, also known as S&amp;P 500, is a stock market index that represents a list of 500 public companies located in the U.S and their performance in the market.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is S&amp;P 500 (Standard and Poor’s 500)?</h2>
<div>The S&amp;P 500 is a stock market index that measures 500 large cap firms in the United States. It shows the market's performance by reflecting the major firms' risks and returns.</div>
<div>It monitors the stock market index and reports on the risks and returns of the firms that are a part of it. The listed firms' large-cap stocks total roughly 9.8 billion or even more and that is why it is used as a yardstick by investors against which all other assets are measured across various industries.</div>
<div>A company's S&amp;P value is calculated by dividing its market capitalization by the entire market cap.</div>
<div>The S&amp;P 500 is a float-adjusted index that measures the value of publicly traded shares, excluding those controlled by government bodies or other governing organizations. Each fluctuation in the share prices of S&amp;P 500 firms influences the value of the index, albeit businesses towards the top of the list have a far larger effect than those down at the bottom.</div>
<div>Although the S&amp;P 500's volatility can make forecasting difficult, professionals can utilize prior trends and data to create accurate estimates when setting interest or return rates.</div>
<div>The entire value of all shares of stock issued by a corporation is referred to as its market capitalization. It is computed by multiplying the number of issued shares with the stock price. </div>
<p>An organization must fulfill the following criteria to be included in the S&amp;P 500:</p>
<div>Companies in the S&amp;P 500 must operate on public markets and publish financial performance data to the public. This involves periodic filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC to provide financial clarity to stockholders. The most stable companies hold a position on the list. Some of them are Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, and more.</div>
<div>When compared to analogous indices, the index encompasses a diverse range of businesses, from technology to healthcare and beyond.</div>
<div>Vanguard 500 Index Investor Shares (VFINX) and Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) are index funds that keep a track of the S&amp;P 500 index and they are excellent places for novices to begin investments. Unlike individual equities, exchange-traded funds can be purchased and sold at any time throughout the trading day or at its end.</div>

<description>
<div>Like any other fiat currency out there, cryptocurrencies can also be divided into smaller units.</div>
<p>Just as the U.S. dollar can be divided into cents and the pound into pence, the smallest available unit of Bitcoin is a satoshi – otherwise known as 0.00000001 BTC.</p>
<div>The satoshi takes its name from Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of BTC.</div>
<p>At first, it was suggested that a satoshi should be used to refer to one hundredth of a Bitcoin — but eventually, the crypto community settled on this being used to refer to one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.</p>
<p>In its plural form, both “satoshi” and “satoshis” are common in crypto circles. When it comes to abbreviations, SAT and S are both widely used.</p>
<p>The fact that Bitcoin is so divisible is actually crucial. Restricting it to just two decimal places would make this cryptocurrency impractical for everyday use, as 0.10 BTC can be worth thousands of dollars. Smaller fractions are vital when it comes to paying transaction fees, as well as when completing micropayments.</p>

<h2>Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?</h2>
<p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym used by the person (or group of people) who wrote the Bitcoin whitepaper — the document that set out the blueprint for the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. It painstakingly detailed hi-tech cryptographic concepts that showed how digital money could circumvent the need for central banks in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>A number of people have been suspected of being Satoshi Nakamoto. Some have gone to great lengths in order to try and clear their name — stressing that they had no involvement in the cryptocurrency’s creation. Others were linked to the pseudonym after linguistic analysis of the whitepaper was performed, and distinctive phrases were matched with other published works. Unfortunately, these investigations also proved inconclusive.</p>
<p>Some — such as Craig Wright — have actively attempted to claim that they are Satoshi Nakamoto. This Australian entrepreneur ended up trying to claim copyright on the Bitcoin whitepaper through U.S. channels, a move that was largely derided by the crypto community.</p>
<p>Adding further to the mystery, Nakamoto ultimately took a step back from the Bitcoin community not long after the cryptocurrency launched. They wrote their last message on the BitcoinTalk forum back in December 2010 and have not been seen since.</p>
<p>Although they may be gone, Satoshi Nakamoto’s presence continues to be felt through the Bitcoin whitepaper, which is available freely online. The smallest possible unit of a single Bitcoin — 100 millionth of one coin — has also been named as a “satoshi” in their honor.</p>

<title>Scaling Problem</title>

<file>scaling-problem.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The scaling problem is the limitations of a blockchain's transaction throughout and ability to have fast and low cast transactions.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Scaling Problem?</h2>
<div>The scaling problem refers to the limitations of a blockchain’s transaction throughput, which ultimately affect the speed and costs of transactions. The scaling problem is tied to how a decentralized network handles blocks of transactions, which depend on factors such as its block size and block time, which is the time it takes to create a new block. This problem became evident after users of Bitcoin, the first blockchain network, experienced delays in transaction settlements and increases in fees whenever usage of the network spikes.</div>
<div>In 2015, the Bitcoin blockchain limited its block size to one megabyte (MB), which was later increased to 2 MB. While the increase in block size slightly alleviated Bitcoin’s scaling problem, many developers cautioned against the types of changes that could potentially make the protocol centralized. This is because every transaction carries data, which means that more transactions also means more data per block, which would ultimately result in requiring miners to have massive disk spaces in order to store a copy of the full Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin community ended up deciding against greatly increasing block size, as it traded decentralization for scalability, which was considered the wrong approach by many.</div>
<div>Therefore, solving the scaling problem has become an uphill task, taking years of time and effort. The scaling problem is exacerbated by the fact that scaling a blockchain network requires proper consensus and coordination between the different parties involved such as the developers, miners and community. However, months of moving back and forth between these groups can still end in disagreements. In such a case, the process may lead to a hard fork where one team activates the upgrade and branches off the main network.</div>
<p>While unscaled blockchains can stay as they are, they will face detrimental consequences like a continuous decrease of transaction speed and increase in costs, as well users leaving for a more scalable network. This has a ripple effect as a lack of users is likely to discourage developers, businesses, miners/stakers from moving forward.</p>

<preview>A scaling solution is a method of enable a system to expand.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Scaling Solution?</h2>
<div>A scaling solution is fundamentally a method of enabling a system’s expansion, such as improving its efficiency and output, without hurting the existing operations. In the blockchain space, a scaling solution typically takes the form of second-layer protocols like sidechains and off-chain layers, that are built on top of a main chain and designed to increase transaction throughput.</div>
<p>Second-layer scaling solutions involve state channels, rollups, blockchain interoperability, sharding and alternative cryptographic functions.</p>
<div>State channels, also known as payment channels, improve a decentralized network’s efficiency and output by allowing multiple individuals to create a direct communication link when sending cryptocurrencies. Despite the number of transactions that take place on a given channel, only the initiating and closing transactions are reflected on the underlying blockchain. Examples of state channel implementations include Lightning Network, Raiden Network and Trinity for the Bitcoin, Ethereum and the Neo networks, respectively.</div>
<p>Sidechains take a different approach as they interconnect two or more blockchain platforms, each of them retaining an independent consensus mechanism. As such, the vulnerability of one blockchain is not transferable to the other. Examples of sidechains include Plasma for Ethereum and Liquid for Bitcoin.</p>
<div>The most promising short and mid-term scaling solution for Ethereum appears to be rollups, particularly optimistic rollups, with Optimism as the prime candidate, which is set to be deployed on Uniswap V3 sometime in 2021.</div>
<div>Sharding is the ultimate scaling solution for Ethereum and other proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, which involves splitting the network into different partitions called shards, which are then assigned different tasks. Sharding enhances the efficiency and output of the network since it increases the transaction load capacity. In this setting, network nodes are grouped and assigned to specific shards.</div>
<p>Another scaling solution comes in the form of alternative cryptographic systems that minimize the amount of transactional data that is recorded on a blockchain, which include ring signatures, multisigs, Schnorr and Threshold signatures.</p>

<h2>What Is a Scam?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency scams have been growing at an alarming scale and have become a popular method for fraudsters to deceive cryptocurrency investors.</p>
<div>Cryptocurrency scams can take many forms — including blackmail, bogus investment schemes and fake business opportunities. Ponzi schemes and fake initial coin offerings have also been common in the past.</div>
<div>Scammers may send users a text message or email asking the user to pay using Bitcoin.</div>
<div>Ponzi schemes are a type of investment scam that may involve BTC and other virtual currencies where existing investors are paid with funds collected from more recent investors.</div>
<p>SEC v Shavers was a case where the organizer of an alleged Ponzi scheme promoted an investment opportunity that had falsely promised investors up to 7% per of returns each week.</p>
<p>The scheme further promised investors that the funds would be used to buy more BTC.</p>

<preview>A scholarship is a popular practice in the Axie Infinity universe where managers lend their free Axies to new players (scholars) and earn passively from the battle rewards.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Scholarship/Scholar?</h2>
<div>Scholarship in Axie Infinity is the process where managers lend their free Axies (digital pets) to “scholars,” who are new to the game and don’t have enough funds to make a team consisting of three NFT monsters required to play the game.  </div>
<div>In the world of NFTs, the term “scholarship” was introduced by a game called Axie Infinity (AXS), the leading blockchain game with $2.5 billion sales so far. </div>
<div>With more than 1 million daily active players, this play2earn game runs smoothly on both smartphones and desktop computers. Its overall gameplay is similar to the popular game, Pokemon Go, where there are digital pets, called Axies (not Pokemons). Players use these pets to battle against each other to earn in-game rewards.</div>
<div>The scholars play the game using managers’ Axies and earn 'Smooth Love Potions' (SLP), the in-game currency that they can use later to breed new Axies and sell them to other players. They can also trade SLP for fiat. The in-game rewards earned by the scholars are shared with the managers who provided Axies to them. Players in the Philippines, where Axie Infinity is extremely popular, can check the SLP PHP price today directly on CoinMarketCap before trading SLP for fiat.</div>
<p>Scholarships in Axie Infinity are utilized mainly by two groups of people. The first group denotes the new players who don’t have funds (as described above), while the second group is of those who have become veterans and have a lot of Axies in their possession, however, they cannot utilize all of them to gain SLP. So, they lend these Axies out to scholars and earn passive rewards in the form of SLP.</p>
<div>Earnings are usually divided into different ratios, including 60/40, 50/50, or 70/30. To earn a scholarship in Axie Infinity, players have to search for managers of guilds that hire Axie scholars. Players can contact these managers and show their interest in getting the scholarship. Every guild has certain criteria which new players have to fulfill to become scholars, get their free Axies, and participate in the game to earn rewards. </div>

<h2>What Is a Script?</h2>
<p>A script, or more specifically, a computer script is a list of commands that are executed by a certain program or scripting language. In fact, scripts can be used to automate processes on a local computer or to generate web pages online. </p>
<p>A script is essentially a program or sequence of instructions that are interpreted and carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor itself. Certain languages have been conceived specifically as script languages.</p>
<p>The most popular in this regard are JavaScript, Perl and REXX. Generally speaking, script languages are a lot easier and faster to code than other, more structured and compiled languages such as C and C++. A script takes longer to run when compared to a compiled program due to the fact that each instruction is handled by another program first, which requires additional instructions.</p>
<p>A script is sometimes used to mean a list of operating system commands which are stored within a file and can perform sequentially by the operating system's command interpreter whenever the list name is entered within a command. </p>
<p>You will find that a script is described as a sequence of instructions that you essentially enter in order to indicate how a sequence of files will be presented. </p>
<p>Scripts have many languages, as they are open-source, which allows users to view and edit the script if they need to. They do not require the file to be compiled but can be when required. Scripts are easy to learn and write and easy to port between different operating systems. Last but not least, scripts are much faster to develop than an actual program and some individuals, as well as companies, write scripts as a prototype for actual programs.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Secondary Market?</h2>
<div>A secondary market is a place where investors or traders can buy and sell different kinds of assets or securities that they own, with others. In the traditional finance sector, this is usually a place where retail investors trade financial instruments like stocks, bonds, options, and futures.</div>
<div>But the role of the secondary market is to provide access for the average investor financial instruments, which they would otherwise not be able to obtain from the primary market, because a primary market in traditional financial environments is usually reserved for “qualified” investors and large institutions. A secondary market can be compared to a retail store like Walmart, where anyone can shop; meanwhile, the primary market is for suppliers, where wholesalers buy in large quantities.</div>
<p>With cryptocurrencies, the same principle applies. The only difference is that currently the primary market equivalent is largely based on token sale platforms. The restriction here is not the number of tokens, but rather the buyer’s qualifications and appetite for risk. In other words: With crypto, the primary buyers are usually those who can afford to risk their money on a new project, or have heard of it first and manage to grab tokens. The secondary crypto/token market is the place where all the others can then buy tokens after the initial token sale is over.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Secure Element?</h2>
<div>A secure element (SE) is a hardware chip designed to run a specified number of applications, support controlled access and store confidential data. The secure element microprocessor chip is ideal for dealing with payment information, personal identification numbers (PIN), passwords and other sensitive information depending on its area of application. In crypto, it is mostly used to permanently seal and protect the private key in hardware wallets like Ledger and CoolWallet and comes with a largely arbitrary CC EAL rating of 1-7. </div>
<div>For example, when used in the identity industry, SE interacts with certificates and biometric data. Some devices that employ SE technology include mobile phones and cold wallets.</div>
<p>A secure element’s key feature is the restriction of access, which allows it to provide unparalleled security. The chip enhances this security by accommodating only pre-installed programs and limiting read and/or write privileges to trusted devices and apps such as point of sale terminals and virtual storage.</p>
<div>Secure elements come in different forms, such as UICCs (universal integrated circuit cards) and microSD hardware cards. Additionally, SE is available with an embedding option that enables it to be pinned on a device’s motherboard. This category of secure elements can either be embedded UICCs or embedded SEs.</div>
<p>Furthermore, other forms of SE operate on the cloud, which brings down the cost of operating a physical hardware chip on a host device. Additionally, a cloud-based SE provides a smooth user experience without abandoning the security provided by microprocessors.</p>
<p>When applied on the hardware level, SE is capable of detecting alterations and hacking attempts. Other features include providing a secure memory to store critical private data such as encryption keys and the generation of key combinations to drive asymmetric encryption.</p>
<div>SE is crucial in critical areas such as authentication, digital signatures, contactless or NFC payments, cryptocurrency wallets, storing biometric data, etc.</div>

<h2>What Is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?</h2>
<div>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an independent federal government regulatory agency that is responsible for protecting individuals and organizations against market manipulation. Its mission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. </div>
<div>The SEC was founded by Congress in 1934, subsequent to the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Therefore, their main focus is on the protection of investors and their exchange assets. American households own more than 58% of the US equity market, through mutual funds, retirement accounts, and other investments, which makes the SEC’s role paramount. </div>
<div>As part of this mission, the SEC requires all market participants to regularly disclose detailed and up-to-date information that investors need to make confident and informed investment decisions. They provide up-to-date investor education and resources through their Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The SEC protects investors by enforcing federal securities laws to hold wrongdoers accountable and prevent further misconduct. </div>
<p>The SEC is also responsible for helping companies raise capital in order for them to create jobs, develop innovative solutions to problems and provide financial investment opportunities. They are also tasked with maintaining orderly and efficient markets by keeping up with market developments and trends and in turn, adjusting and modernizing their expertise and regulations to keep up with the times.</p>
<div>The SEC, currently under the leadership of former MIT blockchain professor Gary Gensler, has had a rocky relationship with the crypto industry since the latter’s inception, with a string of high-profile prosecutions including Ripple Labs, John McAfee, Telegram and others.</div>

<div>Securitization is a way to package the cash flow from assets, including obligations, and sell them to investors. It allows asset holders access to liquidity and investors access to the value. It is a process by which traditional securities are created. It is also relevant to some of the use cases for security tokens and some of the more advanced digital asset finance processes that are emerging in the NFT and DeFi spaces. Thus, securitization offers opportunities for investors and frees up capital for originators (i.e. the company holding the assets), which promotes liquidity in the marketplace.</div>
<p>Security tokens are used to fractionalize asset ownership. They achieve similar effects to traditional securitization as they let illiquid asset owners access their investments. However, they are usually used to break up the value of a high-value asset rather than to pool the value of several low-value assets.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Security Token? </h2>
<p>A security token is essentially a digital form of traditional securities. There are three primary types of traditional securities: equities, debt and a hybrid of debt and equity. Examples of securities include stocks, bonds, ETFs, options and futures. Hypothetically, any of these things can be tokenized to become a security token. It is possible that in the near future, security tokens could serve as a very viable alternative and competitor to stocks and other traditional securities. </p>
<div>It is important to note, however, that security tokens are not the same exact thing as cryptocurrencies. Many people make this mistake. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash run on their own blockchains. Security tokens run on an existing blockchain, meaning that a security token could run on the Ethereum blockchain. Actually, Ethereum is the blockchain that is most commonly used for the deployment of security tokens. Many companies use ERC-20 tokens, which are Ethereum-compatible tokens that can run on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts for execution. </div>
<p>People who own security tokens can profit from the performance of the token. Sometimes, they can also earn profits through dividends in the form of additional tokens and they often get other benefits such as voting power. In this way, security token holders can get many of the same benefits of stocks and other securities. One of the most well-known security tokens is Blockchain Capital (BCap).</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Security Token Offering (STO)?</h2>
<div>A security token offering or an STO is a specific type of public offering where tokenized digital securities — which are known as security tokens —are sold in cryptocurrency exchanges or even on security token exchanges. Tokens can be used to trade real financial assets, and use blockchain virtual ledger systems in order to store as well as validate the token transactions. A security token is this unique token that is issued on a permissioned or permissionless blockchain and represents a stake in an external asset or enterprise.</div>
<p>Security tokens by themselves are used to authenticate the identities electronically through storing personal information. They are issued out by security token services and authenticate a person's identity. They can be used alongside a password in order to prove the identity of an owner. Security tokens are not always secure, however, and have the potential of being lost, stolen or even hacked in the worst-case scenario</p>
<p>Security token offerings differ from initial coin offerings in the sense that while they are made through selling digital tokens to the general public in cryptocurrency exchanges, ICO tokens are the offered cryptocurrency's actual coins, which are entirely digital and even classified as utilities.</p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A single starting point when deriving keys for a deterministic wallet.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Seed Phrase?</h2>
<div>The seed phrase (also known as seed recovery phrase, backup seed phrase or mnemonic phrase) refers to a generated list of 12 to 24 words, in a specific order, used by crypto wallet users to regain access and control of their funds on-chain. This also means that any third party who knows your recovery seed can potentially move your funds to another wallet address.</div>
<div>The seed phrase is a randomly-generated string of words cryptographically derived from the wallet’s private key and paired with 12,18 or 24 words (as per the user’s discretion) from a list of 2,048 English words called the BIP39 Wordlist. This sequence can also be converted to a corresponding series of mapped numbers that provide the user access to his wallet and its public-private key pair. </div>
<div>A crypto wallet’s software is designed to generate these phrases, which users are then tasked to keep. This ensures that even if the hardware malfunctions or gets lost or stolen, they can always download the wallet software again and use the seed phrases to restore access to their assets back.</div>
<p>Keeping a copy of the seed phrase offline is advisable because it makes it invulnerable to hacking. Seed phrases stored on devices connected to the internet are considered unsafe and are not recommended.</p>
<p>The recommended method of keeping a copy of a seed phrase is to write it down and store it somewhere secure like a vault or a safe box. Do not leave a copy of your seed phrase in any format, not even a print file or photo. </p>
<div>Hardware (cold) wallets can securely store private keys without the security risks that come with online wallets. However, the security of your wallet is only as strong as the method that you use to hide your recovery seed.</div>

<file>segregated-witness-segwit.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aimed to fix transaction malleability on Bitcoin.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Segregated Witness (SegWit)?</h2>
<div>Segwit is a soft fork upgrade to the Bitcoin network, meant largely for mitigating scalability problems by increasing block size limits on its blockchain. SegWit works by removing signature data and reducing the size of the transactions, allowing more transactions to be included in the same block. </div>
<p>SegWit was activated in August 2017 after being put forward by Bitcoin developer Peter Wiulle during a Scaling Bitcoin conference in 2015. Its literal meaning is “segregation of transaction signatures” and the implemented update created the idea of UASF, which means user-activated soft fork. </p>
<div>The reason for SegWit’s implementation was straightforward. The Bitcoin blockchain is very slow by modern standards, processing only seven transactions per second (TPS). When Bitcoin prices skyrocket, the transaction activity on the network increases, causing network congestion, higher fees and very long processing confirmation periods. </div>
<p>To speed up confirmations, SegWit modifies the mechanism to not include signatures, which form 60% of a transaction. </p>
<div>Since a Bitcoin transaction contains inputs and outputs, whereas the input is the sender’s address and output is the receiver address, the digital signature is included to verify the solvency of an account. SegWit removes the signature from input and moves it to the end of the transaction.</div>
<p>It also provides a security fix, as the input transaction ID could be modified to fraudulently receive Bitcoin from the sender. Since the signature is moved essentially to the end of the transaction, the transaction identity can’t be tampered with. </p>
<p>A further SegWit proposal called SegWit2x aimed to not only change transaction batching, but also increase Bitcoin’s block size from 1MB to 2MB. However, as SegWit2x required a hard fork and was a more fundamental change to the Bitcoin protocol, the developer community could not reach consensus and ultimately the proposal was abandoned.</p>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A situation in which a miner mines a new block but does not broadcast this new block to the other miners.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Selfish Mining?</h2>
<div>First proposed by Cornell researchers in 2013, “selfish mining” defines a mechanism for miners to work together and increase their profits by creating separate forks and not revealing the mined blocks to the rest of the network. This impacts the overall health of the protocol, since collusion increases the risk for centralization. </div>
<div>Bitcoin mining is reliant on a number of factors, including, but not limited to mining machines efficiency, electricity cost and hash power contributed to the network. The design ensures decentralization by granting rewards to individual miners on the blockchain, which is one of the reasons for the popularity of mining pools as it allows miners to receive continuous and consistent rewards.</div>
<p>However, miners can greatly optimize mining and increase yield by engaging in selfish mining. If they stop declaring new blocks to the public network, it can make the process go faster and reduce resource waste. </p>
<div>The forked blockchains will be smaller than the public blockchain — but miners can ensure that miners from the public blockchain leave their own chain and join the forked chain, by timing their revelation of new blocks. </div>
<p>This process is continued until the forked chain is greater than the original chain and is more lucrative to mine. It can cause the forked chain to become more dominant than the original one, which severely compromises decentralization. </p>
<div>However, selfish mining isn’t a viable long term strategy because, if successful, the miners would have reduced the value of their tokens by damaging the public’s trust in the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, if all miners engage in the same activity, nobody is likely to benefit considerably.</div>

<preview>A situation where a large limit order has been placed to sell when a cryptocurrency reaches a certain value.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Sell Wall?</h2>
<div>A sell wall is a significantly large sell order(s) placed at any price level, which can likely cause the price to drop substantially. It can be placed by anyone, especially high-net worth individuals or whales to manipulate asset prices to their advantage, although others can also help add to that order. </div>
<p>These so-called whales are able to manipulate the prices because of their large holdings or units of an asset. Sell walls can suppress asset prices and force them to be traded within a certain range. They work by indicating to other traders that the price can’t proceed further from a level without passing significant resistance. </p>
<p>When placed intentionally by large holders or whales, it’s often put without any intention to buy from other traders at such levels, but rather to bluff others to place their sell orders below the wall, causing downward price movement. </p>
<div>A massive sell wall indicates that the available supply will soon increase once a certain price is right, thereby driving down both demand and price. Traders then preemptively choose to not buy at that price or to sell off their asset at a lower price, creating shorting opportunities for whales. </div>
<div>Sell walls can be placed and removed continuously on the order book by whales for price manipulation, and most exchanges have interactive depth charts to indicate buy and sell walls. </div>
<div>A buy wall is the opposite of a sell wall, which can provide support and cause the price to move upwards.</div>

<h2>What Is the Semantic Web?</h2>
<p>The Semantic Web is the vision about an extension of the existing World Wide Web which provides software programs with machine-interpretable metadata of published information as well as data. The Semantic Web would essentially add further data descriptors to otherwise existing content and data on the web, and as a result, computers would be able to make meaningful interpretations, similar to the way we as humans process information in order to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>The ambition of the Semantic Web is to enable computers to manipulate information on our behalf.</p>
<p>The Semantic Web idea was created by Tim Berners-Lee, who explains that the word &quot;schematic&quot; indicates machine-processability or what a machine is able to do with the data.</p>
<p>As such, the Semantic Web can be seen as a knowledge graph formed by combining connected, linked data with intelligent content in order to facilitate machine understanding as well as the processing of content, metadata as well as other information objects at scale.</p>
<p>The Semantic Web will lead to smarter, effortless customer experiences by giving the content the ability to understand as well as present itself in the most useful forms which are matched to a customer's specific needs. Semantic Web standards have the potential to unlock a crucial evolution in regards to the web towards intelligence which will allow the content we post online to be presented in a way that can be understood, connected and combined by machines.</p>

<preview>Settlement refers to the process in which a user executes limit or market orders on an order-book-based DEX.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Settlement?</h2>
<div>Settlement refers to the process in which a user executes limit or market orders on an order-book based DEX. The trade order is associated with a crypto wallet, and when the orders are processed, the funds or assets are transferred to that wallet while awaiting the trade to go through.</div>
<p>These trades have to be finalized via a settlement process and need to be given permission by users to add back the assets processed from the trade orders into the crypto wallet.</p>
<div>A proper UX and UI are essential for facilitating the settlement of funds from trade orders, especially for traders executing multiple orders in a short time frame. This ensures a seamless and smooth trading experience while maximizing the funds that are transferred back and available for subsequent trade orders for users at any given time. </div>
<div>Unlike financial institutions or trading in TradFi with stocks, settlements in DEXs and DeFi do not require third-party intermediaries and are automated via code and smart contracts. The mechanisms used to settle orders can be done in a variety of ways, often via  AMMs, aggregators, order books, or a combination of those.
Other involved fees charged to users for settlement often include transaction fees for opening and closing limit or market orders, swap fees for using aggregators, or liquidity provider fees for using an AMM. While these are additional charges, they are often negligible compared to intermediary fees in TradFi, and very affordable and fast for blockchains with high transaction speeds and low gas fees like Solana and Avalanche, allowing users to execute small to high volume trades with any amount using flexible strategies. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Settlement Layer?</h2>
<p>A settlement layer is a layer that essentially provides an anchor for an entire ecosystem, and establishes undeniable security as well as objective finality if anything were to happen on a different blockchain that requires arbitration.</p>
<p>Now, a common trope when it comes to the blockchain ecosystem is that of the “maximalist.” Maximalism is accomplished through unwavering confidence that there is a war between blockchains from which one blockchain will emerge dominant and all future systems, as well as applications, will be built on that one protocol. It is now a new concept in the web-connected world.</p>
<p>An ecosystem that is supported by a settlement layer, rather than one monolithic blockchain can be a computational necessity over a philosophical reference.</p>
<p>A settlement means that it is a payment that is final and delivered. When you pay someone using a credit card such as a MasterCard or a Visa, that is not a settlement, as the settlement comes weeks or months after the fact. In the world of cryptocurrencies, a transaction is a settlement after it is stored within the blockchain.</p>
<p>When you conduct a transaction in a cryptocurrency, you want assurance that the transaction cannot be rolled back, and as such, a merchant does not want a customer to purchase something and have the money they just left  taken back to them at a later point in time. A final settlement means that the cryptocurrency cannot be rolled back. </p>
<p>Whichever chain or protocol ends up serving as the anchor for the ecosystem is who provides the security and immutability, as well as the confidence to support the entirety of the ecosystem itself. The foundational settlement is incorruptible, always available, resilient and only called upon to serve as an arbitrator.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is SHA-256?</h2>
<div>Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) -256 is the hash function and mining algorithm of the Bitcoin protocol, referring to the cryptographic hash function that outputs a 256 bits long value. It moderates the creation and management of addresses, and is also used for transaction verification. Bitcoin uses double SHA-256, meaning that it applies the hash functions twice. </div>
<p>The algorithm is a variant of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). SHA-256 is also used in popular encryption protocols such as SSL,TLS, SSH and open source operating systems such as Unix/Linux. </p>
<div>The hash algorithm is extremely secure and its workings aren’t known in the public domain. It’s used by the United States government to protect sensitive information, thanks to its ability to verify a content of data without revealing it due to the use of digital signatures. Furthermore, it is also utilized for password verification, since it conveniently does not require the storage of exact passwords, as the hash values can be stored and matched with the user entry to verify if it’s correct or not. </div>
<div>In fact, it is nearly impossible to reveal the initial data from a hash value itself. Moreover, a brute force attack is extremely unlikely to succeed thanks to the astronomical number of potential combinations. In addition, it’s also severely unlikely that two data values (known as collision) have the same hash.</div>

<preview>Essentially, a shard is a portion of a blockchain network that has been split into multiple shards, which has its own data.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Shard?</h2>
<p>To understand what a shard is, we'll need to discuss sharding. Sharding is this database partitioning technique that is considered to be an option by blockchain networks and tested on Ethereum, The more users that a blockchain network gets, the slower the network becomes, and this, in turn, leads to a higher level of latency Sharding attempts to improve the network latency through splitting a blockchain network into separate shards, where each of them has their own data, and are separate from other shards.</p>
<p>Essentially, a shard is a portion of a blockchain network that has been split into multiple shards, which has its own data.</p>
<p>Sharding can be accomplished through the horizontal partitioning of databases through division into rows. Shards are conceptualized based on their characteristics, as one shard can be responsible for storing the state and transaction history of a specific address, for example. It is also possible to divide shards based on the type of digital asset which is stored within them.</p>
<p>Transactions that involve a digital asset can be made possible through a combination of shards. Furthermore, each shard is able to be shared among other shards, and this maintains a key aspect to the blockchain technology, which is the existence of a decentralized ledger. The ledger is still accessible to every user and allows them to view the state of all of the transactions.</p>
<p>When we look at Ethereum, the nodes have to be randomly assigned to a shard, and at a random time, they will get reassigned to another randomly chosen shard. This would in turn make it a lot more difficult for an attacker to end up predicting which shards their malicious node can get assigned to, and as such, a takeover is extremely difficult. </p>
<p>Sharding is a requirement due to the fact that it can make hosting full nodes easier. It is a common practice in computer science when it comes to scaling applications so that they can support a lot more data. When sharding is properly implemented in a blockchain such as Ethereum, each user can store just a part of the history of changes to the database, as opposed to the entire thing, which is how a blockchain works by default.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Shard Chain?</h2>
<div>Sharding is the process of splitting a database horizontally in order to spread the load. This is a common concept in computer science.</div>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, specifically in Ethereum, sharding can reduce the network congestion as well as increase transactions per second through the creation of new chains, which are known as shards.</p>
<p>To better define this, sharding refers to splitting the entire Ethereum network into multiple portions, i.e. shards. Each shard would essentially contain lots of its own independent states, and this means that a unique set of account balances as well as smart contracts are in it.  Sharding is the most complex solution out there implemented within Ethereum.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the information which is stored within a shard can still be shared across other nodes, and this keeps the ledger itself decentralized as well as secure due to the fact that everyone can still see all of the ledger entries. The shards simply do not process or store all of the information.</p>
<p>In other words, sharding can be a good way to scale if you want to keep things decentralized as an alternative to scaling up through increasing the size of the existing database. This would make Ethereum a lot less accessible for network validators due to the fact that they would need far more powerful as well as expensive computers. With shard chains, a validator only needs to store the prime or run data for the chard they are validating, and not the entire network. This can in turn speed things up drastically and reduce hardware requirements.</p>

<preview>The second era of Cardano – Shelley Phase is named after Percy Shelley, an English Poet.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Shelley Phase?</h2>
<div>The Shelley phase of Cardano was launched in July 2020 with the release of the Shelley code. The next phase – Goguen – focuses on smart contracts.</div>
<div>The Shelley Phase of Cardano aims to transform the protocol into a fully decentralized blockchain. It will improve the security and scalability of the network by introducing proof-of-stake consensus, delegation, and incentives schemes. This will allow users to stake their ADA tokens and vote on transactions.</div>
<div>A key component of the Shelley Phase is delegation, whereby ADA holders can delegate their stake to other participants on the network who are already running nodes. Those who run nodes are called 'stake pool operators', and when they operate a stake pool, they receive rewards for processing transactions.</div>
<p>The release of Shelley marks the first time the platform was completely decentralized, with network participants being responsible for maintaining the network and reaping the rewards for their participation.</p>
<p>The launch of Shelley opened up several exciting opportunities for Cardano users, including:</p>
<div>Rewards - Staking your ADA on the Cardano blockchain will allow you to receive rewards in ADA. The more ADA you stake, the more rewards you could earn.</div>
<div>Transactions - Staking your ADA makes transactions cheaper and faster.</div>
<div>Pooling - Staking pools allow you to pool together with other users to increase your chances of earning rewards while reducing risks.</div>
<div>Monitoring - The Ouroboros Praos algorithm enables real-time reporting on block production and performance.</div>
<div>Delegation - If you wish to generate rewards without participating directly in staking, you can delegate your ADA to another user who will stake on your behalf.</div>
<p>Cardano’s roadmap consists of five eras: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire.</p>
<p>Byron (2017)</p>
<div>Byron is the foundation era of Cardano. It started with the mainnet’s launch in 2017. Byron was named after Lord George Gordon Byron, an English Romantic Poet. This phase also included a balance check and reward system for staking pools. It was completed in February 2018.</div>
<p>Shelley (2019)</p>
<p>Shelley focused on decentralization and automation. It will include a treasury system to fund future development and support incentives for stake pool operators. Shelley was expected to be completed in 2019 but released in 2020. The Shelley era was named after Percy Shelley, an English poet. </p>
<p>Goguen (2020)</p>
<p>Goguen focuses on smart contracts and metadata standards for these contracts. It helps developers create decentralized apps on the Cardano blockchain by developing a high-assurance smart contract language called Plutus. The Goguen era is named after Joseph Goguen, a computer scientist who worked on mathematical semantics for programming languages and developed algebraic computation models, including abstract state machines.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Shiba Inu Token?</h2>
<div>The Shiba Inu token (SHIB), is a decentralized memecoin based on the Ethereum network. It was initially launched as a joke to compete against Dogecoin, another memecoin. The name comes from the Japanese breed of dog as inspiration, which was the original logo for Dogecoin at its creation. The Shiba Inu token is a community-driven effort that has become a multi-billion dollar project.</div>
<div>There is a difference between coins and tokens. While Dogecoin is a coin (a cryptocurrency that runs on its own blockchain), Shiba Inu is a token (a cryptocurrency created on top of an existing blockchain). There are a few components that separate Shiba Inu from competitors such as its multi-token ecosystem which consist of three tokens: Shiba Inu (SHIB), Leash (LEASH), and Bone (BONE). The Shiba Inu ecosystem also supports other utilities like NFTs and DeFi platforms. Users also have access to ShibaDEX, a non-custodial multi-coin wallet and cross-chain decentralized exchange rolled into one app. ShibaDEX runs on the chain-agnostic AtomicDEX API and provides greater scalability within the growing Shiba community. Users can trade across multiple blockchains via atomic swaps. For example, ShibaDEX users can trade SHIB with BTC, ETH, BNB, MATIC, and many other assets natively across their respective blockchains.</div>
<p>Another unique feature is how this token has received a lot of attention on social media. After Elon Musk tweeted about getting a Shiba Inu dog, the SHIB token price increased by ~300%.</p>
<p>One challenge with a meme token like Shiba Inu is high volatility. Shiba Inu boasts a market cap beyond $6 billion and has a total circulating supply of 549 trillion (and growing). Its value largely depends on its relevance in pop culture rather than technological progress.</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu token was created by an anonymous user called Ryoshi in August 2020. Not much is known about Ryoshi other than the fact they sent 50% of Shiba tokens to Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 2021. Famously, Buterin burned around $6.7 billion in SHIB. He also donated around $1 billion in SHIB to a COVID-19 relief fund for India.</p>

<h2>What Is a Shielded Address?</h2>
<p>With the recent trends in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, there is more interest than ever in methods of performing secure transactions. This interest has led to an increased demand for alternative methods of making financial transactions that are both secure and anonymous. One such alternative method is known as a shielded transaction that uses a shielded address to make payments.</p>
<div>A shielded transaction is a type of transaction that utilizes a cryptographic technique known as &quot;mixing&quot; in order to anonymize the sender's address and the receiver's address. It works by creating a new address specifically for the transaction and then sending the funds from the original sender address to this newly generated address while at the same time sending equivalent funds from another newly generated address back to the receiver's original address. These two new addresses are generated by a mixer service that operates outside of the blockchain and are only used once for each transaction. This makes it impossible to determine where exactly a particular transaction originated or ended up, thus providing anonymity for both senders and receivers. Since only these two unique addresses are used, no one can tell who owns them or where their funds came from or went to.</div>
<h2>Zcash - The Best Implementation of Shielded Transactions</h2>
<div>Zcash is the first cryptocurrency to implement zero-knowledge proofs and the first &quot;miner-friendly&quot; proof of work coin with no founders’ reward. </div>
<p>Zcash transactions are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of the transaction remain private. This is accomplished by using a zero-knowledge proof construction called zk-SNARK.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Shielded Transaction</h2>
<div>The shielded transaction is a way to have greater fungibility in the blockchain by allowing its users to send funds without revealing their transacting partners, amounts sent, or even the transaction history. This is done by creating a new address for each transaction which can only be spent using the recipient's private key.</div>
<p>The reason for this is twofold:</p>
<p>1.) For some use cases, such as international payments, or purchases where you want to obscure your spending habits from others, it is beneficial to not tie your transactions together on the blockchain.</p>
<p>2.) Because Zcash transactions are not fully transparent, the amount of data that can be gathered from the blockchain is limited. This will make it more difficult for outside observers to determine how much total money is being put into specific use cases, like gambling sites.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a SHO (Strong Holder Offering)?</h2>
<div>A strong holder offering (SHO) is a fundraising mechanism where eligible investors are chosen based on their on-chain activities and other proprietary data sets. Notably, a Strong Holder Offering enables a project to attract funding from individuals who are holders of a given cryptocurrency. An SHO model targets public investments and is a product of DAO Maker, which heavily uses it to help launch new projects in the crypto space.</div>
<div>An SHO can be open to people who have held a competitor coin for six months or to active liquidity providers on a decentralized exchange (DEX). In addition, an SHO may focus on individuals with a transactional volume of more than $5 million in the last month.</div>
<p>The framework generally benefits not only a crypto project but also investors who have “strong hands,” or those who can hold on to a coin for extended periods of time. DAO Maker incentivizes investors with strong hands by choosing them as participants of an SHO while also offering them protection. </p>
<p>However, the crowdfunding model also allows participants to seek refunds should they want to withdraw support since DAO Maker’s update on the offering. SHO has already been renamed to refundable Strong Holder Offering (rSHO). Note that the right to a refund expires if the value of the token issued by a project during the initial Strong Holder Offering increases and holds at 400% for 120 days.</p>
<div>Furthermore, DAO Maker subjects a project to a series of tests before opening the door to an SHO. In doing so, only a few startups can offer the service in 12 months, which means that only projects that can stick to their roadmap would dare to apply, consequently discouraging scammers and low-quality startups.</div>

<title>Short Squeeze</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/short-squeeze</url>
<file>short-squeeze.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A short squeeze is an unusual market condition that causes the price of a coin to rise quickly, encouraging traders (who are betting against the price of the token) to buy it to avoid losses.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Short Squeeze?</h2>
<div>A short squeeze in the crypto market coincides with a sharp rise in the price of a crypto coin. Those holding short positions on the coin are forced to begin buying the asset (as a result of a FOMO). Albeit a common occurrence in the financial markets, they are always challenging to predict.</div>
<div>A short seller follows the bear market price trend and bets on the coin price to fall. They can use multiple methods and tools to ensure their strategy is successful. However, if prices start rising, their short positions lead to losses. If their losses rise too high, short sellers find it a better option to close their position. This often happens in margin and futures trading. Traders can also manually close the position, although building an automatic stop-loss trigger is a preferred strategy.</div>
<h2>What Triggers a Short Squeeze?</h2>
<p>When numerous short sellers close their short positions in a short span, which means they keep buying the coin, a spike in price is observed. It triggers the short squeeze conditions. If all shorters initiate buying, demand outweighs supply, which causes the crypto coin’s prices to rise. A significant rise in trading volumes that lasts only a short time often follows a short squeeze.</p>
<p>An important factor to look at is the short interest at any given time. The main reason people short the market is to benefit from the high-interest rate paid out if their predictions are correct. Consequently, there is always an opportunity for short squeeze conditions, especially in the volatile crypto markets.</p>
<h2>What Is a Long Squeeze?</h2>
<p>The flip side of the short squeeze is the long squeeze. This happens when there is increased pressure to sell a crypto asset because of the market conditions. This often results in a quick price collapse since more supply exceeds demand. However, long squeezes are less common. Despite this, it is important to be aware of their existence when trading in the crypto markets.</p>
<div>Some advanced traders will look out for conditions that could create short squeeze opportunities. They aim for longing and profit from the increases in prices. This strategy entails buying a crypto asset in large quantities just before the squeeze and selling the assets immediately after the price starts spiking.</div>
<p>However, one must exercise caution. Heavily shorted crypto markets are that way for a good reason. Valid reasons lead numerous investors to bet on the crypto price going down. One should be wary of taking any position on heavily shorted tokens. Before making any trade, study the crypto market and why traders are betting against it.</p>

<title>Side Chain</title>

<file>side-chain.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain, where there is a two-way link between the primary chain and sidechain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Side Chain?</h2>
<div>A sidechain is a side blockchain that is linked to another blockchain, referred to as the main chain, via a two-way peg.</div>
<p>Imagine a global decentralized network of various blockchains, each with their own sets of rules, functionalities and purposes, that remain independent from each yet form one seamless ecosystem. That’s the sidechain vision.</p>
<div>This sophisticated cryptographic mechanism enables tokens and other digital assets to move back and forth freely from the main chain. An example of a sidechain is the Liquid Network, a settlement layer that allows traders and trading platforms to enjoy faster and more private transactions, as well as digital asset creation. Since the Liquid Network is pegged to Bitcoin, which is the main chain in this example, only activities involving Bitcoin are possible. </div>
<p>It works like this: </p>
<p>The main chain user first needs to send coins or other digital assets to an output address where they are locked and unspendable anywhere else. After the transaction is complete, a confirmation is relayed across the chains. This is followed by a waiting period for added security. Afterward, the coins or assets will be fully transferred on the sidechain, enabling users to move them around freely on the new network. If a user wants to send the coins back to the main chain, he only needs to reverse the process.</p>
<div>Sidechains come in many variations depending on the functions they are built for. While both Liquid and Rootstock are Bitcoin sidechains, they function very differently, since the latter is specifically created for the purpose of running smart contracts more efficiently. </div>
<div>Ethereum 2.0 has its own variation of sidechains called shard chains that are attached to the recently launched Beacon Chain, which aims to ultimately become the main chain of proof-of-stake (PoS)-based Ethereum.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Side Channel Attack?</h2>
<p>A side channel attack is a hacking method that exploits a computer’s inherent “tells&quot; that unintentionally convey information. These attacks take advantage of the seemingly harmless physical outputs of computers. For instance, an algorithm may be able to tell what kind of information has passed through a hard drive by measuring the sound of the hardware at work. The principle is similar to a bank robber listening to ticks in a safe as they turn a coded dial. However, these “ticks” don’t need to be based on sound.</p>
<p>Every computer is vulnerable to giving up clues in its operations. They give off sounds, light signatures and other telling signs that can all be used to communicate what is happening. In the world of cryptocurrency, these kinds of attacks could be used to discern when a private key is being put into a hardware wallet as it could radiate a higher signal.</p>
<p>Side channel attacks use information like timing, sound, power levels and more to begin breaking down the information and deducing key variables. The attacks can be used by hackers to glean almost any type of information if it is not sufficiently protected. This can be devastating to even the most encrypted networks that don’t account for what happens beyond the electronic ones and zeros that execute operations.</p>

<file>signal.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Signals are a call to action to either buy or sell an asset.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Signal?</h2>
<div>A signal is a suggestion or call to action to either buy or sell an asset, or even to not engage with a particular or group of assets. A signal can be generated through human or artificial intelligence analysis through historical data and trading patterns, as well as conclusions derived from technical, fundamental and sentiment analysis. </div>
<p>A signal can come from a variety of sources, including but not limited to: </p>
<p>The complexity of the signals may vary, but they are provided mostly in simple to-do format. It must be noted that nearly all signals are extremely time-sensitive or based on low-time preference; hence their information dissemination and execution must be rapid for effective results. </p>
<p>Generally, signals are provided free-of-cost, but people often pay for signals from experienced investors/traders with a proven track record. There are countless Telegram groups that have offered crypto signal services over the years. </p>
<p>Some are free, while others require you to do simple tasks before becoming a member, such as inviting a certain number of other users to help grow the group. There are also other signal groups that seek payment, whether that be a one-time fee or on a subscription basis.</p>
<div>However, due to the dynamic and random nature of the market, any past performance isn’t a guarantee of future results. Hence, signals are understood more as guidelines open to interpretation, rather than being of factual nature. </div>
<div>Furthermore, some notorious pump-and-dump (P&amp;D) groups are known to hide behind the veil of signal groups. With some of these groups numbering in tens of thousands of members, their coordinated trading often provides them the ability to manipulate prices thanks to their collective influence. Unfortunately, by the time group members get the buy signal, the asset has already been “pre-pumped” by insiders, leading members to buy the cryptocurrency at an inflated price that leaves it vulnerable to a swift and steep correction. Hence, it is recommended to always be cautious when joining signal groups.</div>

<h2>What Was the Silk Road?</h2>
<p>Silk Road was an online black market that existed on the dark web, which has now been shut down by the FBI. It had accepted Bitcoin for transactions.</p>
<div>When Bitcoin was designed, a key feature that BTC tried to guarantee was anonymity. </div>
<div>Cryptocurrencies in general are anonymous. But this only applies if there is no trail left with the transaction. </div>
<p>For example, buying cryptocurrencies with a credit card can create a trail. </p>
<p>Similarly, buying a cryptocurrency on an exchange may leave trail proof of a delivery address. </p>
<p>Ross Ulbricht was the brainchild of the Silk Road. Created in 2011, it served as a marketplace where customers could order a wide range of illicit goods including fake IDs and drugs.</p>
<p>Customers of the market could often pay with cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>The marketplace is often renowned as the frontrunner of the illegal narcotics business. </p>
<p>Silk Road is believed to have generated roughly $1.2 billion over the period of two years. It is also believed to have raked in around $80 million worth of commissions. </p>
<p>When the FBI shut down Silk Road in October 2013, 174,000 BTC were seized. </p>
<p>But at least 444,000 BTC are believed to be completely missing. </p>
<div>Ulbricht is suspected to have used another computer which may possess the details of missing BTC and lost coins.</div>
<p>He was convicted of seven charges emanating from the SIlk Road Marketplace by a court in Manhattan.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a SIM Swap?</h2>
<p>A SIM swap is a criminal heist that targets weak points in two-factor authentication (2FA) systems, which many individuals use to provide an additional layer of security for their social media, banking or other online accounts.</p>
<p>These types of attacks are a result of cybercriminals tampering with a victim’s mobile phone service. </p>
<p>The result is then that the criminal obtains access to the victim’s data and transfers the phone number to a new SIM card the hacker owns. </p>
<p>This means the hacker can access the victim’s email and reset any confidential information, including logins. </p>
<p>The risk is heightened when a criminal obtains access to the individual’s cryptocurrency credentials, including details to their crypto wallets. </p>
<p>The most worrisome part of SIM swap attacks is the ease by which these types of crimes can be executed. </p>
<p>It only requires the victim’s mobile carrier number to be ported to a new phone number. </p>
<p>There are several ways the mobile carrier number can be ported to the hacker’s new number. </p>
<p>These include by phishing or even merely buying details on the victim. </p>
<p>A January 2020 study by Princeton University indicated 39 of 50 attempts by researchers to pull off SIM swaps were deemed successful. </p>
<div>A 15-year-old school student in New York was able to execute a SIM swap attack on a cryptocurrency entrepreneur. </div>
<p>The cybercrime resulted in drastic financial consequences as they stole digital assets worth $24 million.</p>
<p>Europol was able to detect a cybercriminal ring that conducted 100 such attacks. </p>
<p>This led to losses of about $3.7 million.</p>

<title>Simple Agreement for Future Token (SAFT)</title>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A Simple Agreement for Future Token (SAFT) is a contractual agreement at the time of launch of a token creating ownership rights for token investors at a future date.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Simple Agreement for Future Token (SAFT)?</h2>
<p>A SAFT is an investment contract that guarantees an eventual transfer of ownership of crypto tokens from developers to investors. Through the use of the SAFT, which is regulated financial security, finances can be arranged before the token’s launch while giving future ownership rights to SAFT holders. Included within the contract is the precise contribution of the investor, as well as the amount of discounted tokens that would be made available to them. In addition, the contract would also explicitly state the future date upon which the transfer of cryptocurrencies will be executed.</p>
<div>SAFTs are often mistaken for initial coin offerings (ICOs), which is a more mainstream form of token financing. However, unlike ICOs, SAFTs are directed primarily to accredited investors instead of public users on a launchpad. As a result of this setup, the general public is restricted from having access to the security, and SAFT holders would need to meet specific criteria in terms of income, experience, net worth, etc. This points toward the exclusivity that is intrinsic to these agreements and how they essentially guarantee ownership rights to their holders. This setup allows financial institutions such as investment banks or hedge funds to participate in token financing without having to worry about regulatory concerns. On the other hand, cryptocurrency developers, through SAFTs, have the benefit of accessing financing mechanisms that are linked to mainstream financial channels. The way SAFT is structured, it could ideally be implemented to jumpstart development on a cryptocurrency before its ICO is initiated after it is shown to have potential.</div>
<div>Similarly, SAFTs hold core distinctions to cryptocurrencies themselves because they are regulated. Tokens are technically not classified as securities, given that their existence on the blockchain overrides governmental jurisdiction. SAFTs are entirely in compliance with the regulatory and legal framework of the particular jurisdiction, as it is a security tradeable within the mainstream financial system. With its unique characteristics, SAFT bridges the world of blockchain to that of mainstream financial institutions and thus occupies a unique space in the broader dimension of tokenomics.</div>
<div>However, it is important to point out that SAFT is a conventional contractual agreement and, therefore, not a blockchain-embedded smart contract. As a result, it does not hold the core characteristics of self-execution or immutability. However, despite these gaps, SAFTs can be enforced in a court of law, given that it falls within legal and regulatory jurisdiction.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)?</h2>
<p>Short for Simplified Payment Verification, SPV is a lightweight client to verify blockchain transactions, downloading only block headers and requesting proof of inclusion to the blockchain in the Merkle Tree.</p>
<div>A Merkle Tree is a tree structure in cryptography, in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. </div>
<p>SPVs allow light clients to determine whether a transaction has been included in BTC.</p>
<p>Light clients refer to wallets running on low-end systems. </p>
<p>Hence SPVs verify whether a transaction has been executed. </p>
<p>Running a full node with a Merkle Tree requires the entire blockchain to be downloaded. </p>
<p>This is where the role of SPV can simplify the process greatly. </p>
<p>This is because SPV proofs only require the Merkle root of each root to verify the authenticity of the transactions. </p>
<p>This means only 80 bytes per block needs to be stored in contrast to the significantly bigger size per block that is required under larger nodes. </p>
<p>However, there are also downsides attached to SPVs. </p>
<p>These relate to cyber security. </p>
<p>In the event of a 51% attack on a cryptocurrency, the hackers may be successful in prompting the SPV proofs into validating illegitimate transactions. </p>
<p>However, research is underway on how to mitigate the threat of such scenarios. </p>
<p>Nakamoto’s whitepaper stated Bitcoin transactions can be verified without running the full node network. </p>

<preview>A platform built on Sia blockchain for decentralized content storage.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Skynet?</h2>
<div>Skynet is a protocol developed on the Sia blockchain to provide decentralized storage, easing content delivery and file sharing over the internet. In many aspects, it can be seen as an alternative infrastructure for the internet. </div>
<div>To grasp the concept of Skynet, it is important to know about Sia and what it does. Sia is a blockchain platform developed to allow users to lend a part of their hard drives. Other users can rent part of the hard drive to store encrypted data, meaning they are in complete control of their data. The borrower pays for that space with Siacoins (SC), which is Sia’s native token.</div>
<div>Sia is owned by its parent company Nebulous. Siacoin uses the PoW algorithm, meaning it’s a mineable coin. In addition, it’s an open-source project. However, the parent company charges a small commission from lenders and borrowers when they make a storage contract.  </div>
<p>Skynet is based on the idea that instead of any third-party corporation, users should have control over their data. </p>
<p>Much like the internet, Skynet’s most useful applications are on the web. Users can browse and use Skynet’s web applications using a web browser. Skynet applications can be social media sites, desktop apps, storage apps, mobile apps, and nearly everything else that can be built on the traditional web. </p>
<h2>What Makes Skynet Different?</h2>
<p>At its core, Skynet liberates users from centralized servers. Traditional web requires website owners to host their website on servers controlled by owners. Because it’s decentralized, users themselves have full control over their data.</p>
<div>It offers benefits to both developers and users by letting them be a part of Web3. When it comes to developers, they don’t have to pay for hosting their applications, can maintain a failover site, and prevent corporations’ access to their resources. </div>
<p>Users can have complete control over their data and experience an ad-free web.</p>
<p>Skynet is still in its early days and its success will hugely rely on how the audience responds to it over time.</p>

<title>Slippage</title>

<file>slippage.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Slippage happens when traders have to settle for a different price than what they initially requested due to a price movement.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Slippage?</h2>
<div>When cryptocurrency traders place a buy or sell order on an exchange, they typically expect said order to be filled at the exact price they’ve chosen. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case, due to a costly problem called slippage.</div>
<div>Slippage happens when traders have to settle for a different price than what they initially requested due to a movement in price between the time the order (say for Bitcoin) enters the market and the execution of a trade. This phenomenon can occur in all markets, like forex and stocks. However, it is more frequent, and a lot worse, in crypto markets (especially on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap) due to the high levels of price volatility. In addition, common pain points that the vast majority of altcoins suffer from such as low volume and liquidity may also contribute to slippage.</div>
<div>There are two types of slippages: positive and negative. If the actual executed price is lower than the expected price for a buy order, it is considered positive slippage since it gives traders a better rate than they originally intended. If the actual executed price is higher than the expected price for a buy order, it is considered negative slippage since it gives traders a less favorable rate than they originally tried to execute. The opposite is true for sell orders.</div>
<p>Too much slippage can cost frequent traders a lot of money. In order to reduce, if not eliminate slippage, traders can avoid executing market orders and opt to execute limit orders instead since these types of orders don’t settle for an unfavorable price.</p>
<div>On the other hand, setting your slippage tolerance too low (normally you have to set a percentage of 0.1% to 5%), may mean that your transaction never executes and you miss cashing in (or out) during a big price jump or drop. Set it too high and you may become the victim of frontrunning. </div>
<p>Slippage can quickly become a frustratingly slippery slope for the less experienced trader, so it’s important to understand the volatility of both the cryptocurrency and the trading platform you’re dealing with.  </p>

<preview>The smallest time period in the Cardano blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Slot (Cardano)?</h2>
<div>A slot is the smallest time period in a blockchain. For Cardano, the slot duration is one 1 second. Each slot has a slot leader, who has the right to create a single block for that slot and can choose not to do so. If the slot leader does not create a block, there are two consequences: firstly, no blocks are created by anyone in that slot; secondly, the next slot leader will be chosen from a different staking pool than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>Cardano's proof-of-stake protocol is based on a system of epochs and slots.  </div>
<div>Each Cardano epoch consists of slots with each slot lasting for one second. A Cardano epoch currently includes 432,000 slots (5 days). In the Byron era, which was the genesis of Cardano, and is now replaced by Shelley mainnet, there were 21,600 slots per epoch and one slot leader per slot. The Shelley era has 20 times as many slots per epoch, however only one out of five slots have a leader.</div>
<p>Each slot includes a single block, which is produced by the system's slot leaders. These blocks are created in random order and there is no guarantee that all slots will be filled with a block. When there is no block included in a slot, it is called an empty slot.</p>
<p>Empty slots may occur when no delegate wins the leadership for that slot and therefore fails to produce a block within that time period. Empty slots also appear naturally due to network latency or simply because network participants fail to recognize winning blocks fast enough.</p>
<div>In the Ouroboros Praos algorithm, which builds on previous protocols by the IOHK team, each block is generated by a slot leader that randomly chooses a time slot (an interval of time) to produce a block. This way, no two leaders can be active at once and all blocks are created independently of each other.</div>
<h2>A Little About Cardano</h2>
<p>Cardano is a blockchain platform with a native governance token, ADA. The project was created by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, who left the company in 2014 to start Cardano.</p>
<div>Cardano's team set out to create a scalable and secure cryptocurrency that could have a real-world utility. Cardano's main innovation that gives it an edge is its use of a unique layer architecture. The Control Layer has all of the data about transfers and account balances stored on it and is similar to other blockchains (like Bitcoin). The Computation Layer runs smart contracts, handles financial calculations for loans and insurance policies, etc.</div>
<p>The Cardano team has big plans for the future. They want to make ADA a globally accepted method of payment and are partnering with companies around the world to accomplish this goal. They also plan to launch sidechains — separate blockchains that can interact with the main chain but are faster and more flexible.</p>

<preview>A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify or enforce a contract on the blockchain without third parties.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Smart Contract?</h2>
<div>A smart contract is a self-executing computer program with the terms of the buyer’s and seller’s agreement directly embedded into lines of code. The program, along with the agreement it contains, is distributed across a decentralized blockchain network such as Ethereum or Ontology. A smart contract is automatically executed when certain conditions are met. Once the code is executed, it is virtually impossible to reverse or alter.</div>
<p>Smart contracts enable transactions and agreements to be anonymously executed among two or more parties that do not trust each other, without the need for a third-party authority, justice system or another external mechanism.</p>
<p>A smart contract is analogous to a vending machine, as opposed to a store where you have to pay a merchant to buy. With a vending machine, you don’t have to deal directly with the merchant (vending machine owner) since you can simply transact automatically by inserting coins in the machine and your chosen soda will drop. This direct way of transacting without the need to know or trust who you’re dealing with is what makes a smart contract favorable. In fact, businesses have already started implementing smart contracts in their systems as they provide better protection from losses, as well as make customers feel safe.</p>

<title>Smart Contract Audit</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract-audit</url>
<file>smart-contract-audit.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A smart contract audit is a security check done by cybersecurity professionals meant to ensure that the on-chain code behind a smart contract is devoid of bugs or security vulnerabilities.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Smart Contract Audit?</h2>
<div>A smart contract audit is an extensive methodical examination and analysis of a smart contract’s code that is used to interact with a cryptocurrency or blockchain. This process is conducted to discover errors, issues and security vulnerabilities in the code in order to suggest improvements and ways to fix them. Generally, smart contract audits are necessary, because most of the contracts deal with financial assets and/or valuable items. </div>
<p>Such checks are complex, as smart contracts often interact with each other and any integrations with third-party systems can also result in making the system vulnerable. Because of this, the checks are often expanded to other smart contracts involved in any interactions, and even those that the ones it interacts with are interacting with. Such checks usually include both running tests and manual code analysis.</p>
<p>Smart contracts often manage huge quantities of funds and a single bug or vulnerability can result in great losses. More precisely, the users and stakeholders of the decentralized application in question could lose all the assets that are part of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The recommendations made by the auditors are conveyed in advance to the project team and their actions in response are noted in the final report. It is considered a mark of authenticity and integrity for the project. For that reason, teams are keen on getting an audit to win user confidence and raise the project’s credibility. These audits are typically carried out in several steps. </p>
<p>The initial step is the team and the auditing group agreeing on the scope and specifications of the audit. It means that the design, purpose, architecture and other details of the smart contract are given to the auditors. Next is the testing phase, where the auditors test the individual functions (unit tests) and then larger parts (integration tests). </p>
<p>Automated bug detection and analysis tools are also used to look for commonly known vulnerabilities in the contracts. Finally, auditors manually inspect the code to understand the developer’s intentions and interpret the findings in that context. Finally, the report is issued with the findings and the applied fixes by the team. </p>
<div>The importance of smart code audits can be gauged by the fact that the Ethereum chain split in 2016 was because of a code vulnerability exploited by an attacker, putting millions of dollars of funds at risk. A “recursive call bug” allowed the attacker to drain the &quot;DAO&quot; democratized hedge fund millions of dollars worth of ETH. The subsequent actions by the community over whether to forcibly return the funds caused disagreements and a hard fork.</div>
<div>Smart code audits are increasingly important in the burgeoning DeFi industry, where bug-filled smart contracts are often rushed out to meet investor demand. This has led to a number of costly hacks in 2020 totalling millions, most notably Harvest, Yam Finance, bZx, Balancer and Eminence.</div>

<title>Smart Home</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-home</url>
<file>smart-home.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A smart home is a technology that allows to manage and automate household systems, such as lights, doors, thermostats, security alarms, and other connected equipment from a distance.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Smart Home?</h2>
<p>A smart home employs one or more internet-connected gadgets to allow you to operate and monitor your house from another room – or even another country.</p>
<p>Smart home technology may even allow you to automate things like feeding your cat and watering the plants every day, even if you're on vacation, with just a smartphone or tablet, fairly dependable devices that we always find in our pockets. While you're at work, you may check on your new pups or double-check if you turned off the air conditioner in your room.</p>
<p>This technology can also monitor and offer intelligent solutions based on your behavior. If you are away from home, for example, a smart home can monitor the temperature and heat up/cool down the space as soon as it falls outside of its predefined range. In the cab returning from the airport, a smart home will allow you to turn up the heat in your room.</p>
<div>A smart home's technology is designed to make our lives easier. This may include a smart fridge that keeps track of your groceries and commodities, such as toilet paper, and orders more on your behalf from an online supermarket, or a smart fridge that makes meal recommendations based on the contents in your fridge. In reality, the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) is limitless.</div>
<p>Another major advantage of smart homes is that they might possibly reduce your utility bills by constantly monitoring your heating, water, and power usage.</p>
<p>Smart home technology can also help to protect the most vulnerable members of our society. If an older person forgets to take their medicines, falls down, or stops following their typical schedule, some smart gadgets can send out an alarm.</p>
<h2>How Does Blockchain Technology Contribute Towards Smart Homes?</h2>
<div>The security concerns associated with IoT and smart devices are quite popular, and although average consumers may not be concerned about them, businesses, governments, and any other institution take these issues quite seriously. By enclosing the client command in a smart contract, blockchain technology can alleviate the security challenges that come with a single point of access.</div>
<div>A hacker has no way of knowing which client the message would be sent to, and even if they find a way to intercept the signed transaction, they can only cause a denial of service by stopping the message from reaching the blockchain client. Everything that is mined is synchronized throughout the network's numerous nodes.</div>
<h2>Examples of Smart Home Technology</h2>
<p>The following are the most popular smart home options currently available.</p>
<p>Smart Speakers: Smart speakers are capable of much more than just playing music. They can do things like searching the internet, telling you the weather, debriefing you on the news, operating as a personal assistant, and acting as a central control point for your whole smart home system. You can manage practically every part of your house with only your voice if you have the correct smart speakers. Alexa can tell you who is at the front door, Siri can turn off the light you left on upstairs, and Google Assistant can dial down the heat. If you want to utilize your smart speaker as a home automation hub, make sure the devices you purchase are compatible with your speaker, since not all of them are.</p>
<p>Smart TVs: Whether you have cable or not, smart TVs are excellent because they allow you to view pretty much whatever you want, whenever you want. In most cases, a smart TV refers to the television itself, however in this situation, it refers to all IoT video streaming devices. </p>
<p>When it comes to video streaming, there are a plethora of possibilities these days. You may acquire a smart TV that streams Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and other services directly from the device, or you can get a system that connects to your regular TV. </p>
<p>Smart Thermostats: Smart thermostats allow you to monitor your HVAC system from anywhere. You may even put them on a schedule to avoid wasting electricity when no one is home. Some smart thermostats offer a sensor option that alters the temperature automatically whenever required.</p>

<title>Smart Token</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-token</url>
<file>smart-token.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Smart tokens are simply regular tokens that not only transmit value they contain but also all the information needed to execute a transaction simultaneously.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Smart Token?</h2>
<div>If tokens are how the crypto sector now refers to all user-generated value-containing assets that are compliant with the various standards on a blockchain network, then “smart tokens” are simply regular tokens that not only transmit value they contain but also all the information needed to execute a transaction simultaneously.</div>
<p>One way to differentiate regular tokens from smart tokens is that the former only transmits value, while the latter additionally contains in-built programmability to manipulate that value.</p>
<p>As the term suggests, smart tokens do this by incorporating smart contracts that can use all the information needed to authorize a transaction at once in three layers:</p>
<p>Smart tokens as such will contain enhanced information, such as counterpart identity, and invoicing data.</p>
<p>The central idea is this: when tokenized, unlawfully intercepted payment authorization data is rendered valueless because it simply isn’t there; it is replaced by a token. This means the data can, in effect, hide in plain sight.</p>
<p>The Bancor decentralized trading protocol created one of the earliest popular standards for smart tokens; in 2017, the company launched its own “smart tokens” that used smart contracts to implement direct convertibility within them.</p>
<p>Its use case was simple: tokens that could be bought or sold at any time directly via their own smart contract, without needing to go through an exchange or find a matching exchange. This means a direct on-chain token interaction, instead of Dapp interactions like on a typical DEX now.</p>
<p>Author:</p>
<div>PlasmaFinance is a DeFi dashboard that aggregates the most popular decentralized finance protocols from multiple blockchains. The PlasmaFinance platform provides the industry’s most robust analytics, easy-to-use tools and access to the most profitable defi yields across any protocol.</div>
<div>PlasmaFinance incorporates a suite of DeFi products including its own PlasmaSwap DEX, advanced trading and gas optimization tools, fiat on/off ramp for DeFi as well as an IDO launchpad, SpacePort.</div>

<title>Snapshot</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/snapshot</url>
<file>snapshot.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A snapshot in the blockchain world is the act of documenting the status of a blockchain at a specific block height.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Snapshot?</h2>
<div>The capacity to record the condition of anything at a precise moment in time is referred to as a snapshot. A snapshot in the blockchain world is the act of documenting the status of a blockchain at a specific block height. It is employed to keep track of the overall quantity and balance of token holders at any time.</div>
<h2>The Traditional Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taking a snapshot, also known as a storage snapshot, is similar to taking a photograph of your server's data at a certain point in time. Snapshots are not a complete duplication of the data on your hard disk; they are largely metadata that specifies the state of your information. They can also only be saved on the local server or a device where they were generated.</p>
<p>As live data in application tests, such as when testing a new application or program or trying out new settings, may put your system at risk, snapshots are commonly utilized for test/dev. They provide access to an infinite number of clones of your data, allowing you to work on development without affecting your regular routine. Workflows may be automated, tested, iterated, and dismantled without taking up a lot of extra storage space. As a fast failsafe, you may roll the server back to an earlier point if an error occurs.</p>
<p>Snapshots are commonly used in production; in fact, every time you generate a backup, the system begins with a snapshot.</p>
<p>Full backups, on the other hand, can take hours to make and sometimes must be done overnight due to the system resources they demand. Snapshots, on the other hand, can be created in seconds and as frequently as needed. You may also deduplicate the data being snapshotted using technologies like modified block tracking (CBT).</p>
<p>Snapshots are only designed to be kept for a limited period of time, but if not properly handled, they can result in incredibly complicated data chains and very long consolidation times.</p>
<h2>Cryptographic Snapshots</h2>
<p>A snapshot in cryptocurrency is a record of the status of a blockchain at a specific block height. It captures the whole blockchain ledger, including all existing addresses and their related data.</p>
<h2>What Are Snapshots in Crypto Airdrop Events?</h2>
<div>Before each round of an airdrop event, snapshots are frequently taken. Tokens are distributed based on the balance of each blockchain address available during the snapshot period. </div>
<p>Snapshots are taken to record each token holder's balance at a certain moment in time (i.e., block height). Users can usually shift their funds after the snapshot is taken without jeopardizing their eligibility for that round of pay-out.</p>

<title>Social Engineering</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/social-engineering</url>
<file>social-engineering.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Social engineering is the use of deception to manipulate people into performing an action or giving away their secret information.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Social Engineering?</h2>
<div>Social engineering is a malicious activity that uses human interactions to trick users into making mistakes that compromise their confidential information or simply giving it away. Since it is used to steal online identities,  social engineers are often called &quot;cybercriminals.&quot; Cybercriminals have used social engineering for years to obtain personal information from vulnerable internet users who lack information related to internet security. Since most internet users prefer not to use antivirus applications and disregard security rules to prevent themselves from hacks, a large number of users fall a victim to such criminal activities. </div>
<p>Cybercriminals often use psychological manipulation, such as impersonating an employee from the company one works for and getting access to personal accounts.</p>
<div>Although there are several other exploitation techniques, social engineering relies on human error, making it difficult to identify. Mistakes made by legitimate users can be much more unpredictable than malware-based intrusions that rely heavily upon vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. Social engineering gives cybercriminals a better chance of getting past security measures simply because human errors are inevitable.</div>
<h2>Types of Social Engineering</h2>
<div>Social engineering can be compared to a chess game, except that instead of using pieces on a board, criminals are trying to use people's emotions. There are different kinds of attacks, including baitings that involve luring users in with something they want and then taking it away from them once their guard is down. Other types include scareware that involves faking as if something has gone wrong when everything is fine; pretexting where someone poses as another person online. Other notable ones are phishing and spear phishing. All these attacks rely on initially building trust, creating a sense of urgency, and then heightening the emotions to manipulate the user into making an error so that the cybercriminal spearing the attack can steal the user's identity.</div>
<h2>Social Engineering Technique</h2>
<div>A social engineering attack cycle is a systematic way to gain access and sensitive information from users, using their vulnerability. These criminals tend not to use brute force methods because it helps them keep a track of what users are doing on their computer or phone without being detected by anti-virus programs.</div>
<p>The cycle involves gathering background info about someone then establishing trust through interactions initiated either directly or through interactions seeded at various points during online chats/conversations via email attachments etc. Then in the third phase, the attacker exploits the user's trust and manipulates them to take the desired action. In the last phase, the attacker disengages themselves from the user.</p>
<h2>Social Engineering Attacks in Crypto World</h2>
<p>In the crypto world, cybercriminals are mostly targeting the social media accounts of prominent personalities of the crypto industry. After gaining access, they use the pre-built trust of these personalities to exploit people in multiple ways. Secondly, they are also targeting users to get access to their private wallets.</p>
<h2>How to Prevent Yourself From Social Engineering?</h2>
<p>Social engineering attacks are a huge problem in the world of cybersecurity. Preventing them is a top priority for many businesses, organizations, and individuals. The best practices to be employed are:</p>
<p>Set spam filters on all email accounts so even if attackers manage to get access to them, they won't be able to send any messages or access anything sensitive with ease. </p>
<p>One should never use the same password across different accounts as many accounts have been compromised in the world of cryptocurrency due to this issue. </p>
<div>Ensure every website requires you to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) system (something that requires you to verify your identity twice, firstly, through your password and, secondly, another method) and multi-factor authentication whenever possible. </div>
<p>Finally, educate everyone about these threats by making security education part of the curriculum.</p>

<title>Soft Cap</title>

<file>soft-cap.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The minimum amount that an initial coin offering (ICO) wants to raise.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Soft Cap?</h2>
<div>Softcap refers to the minimum defined limit for the collection of funds specified by a project’s team for its fund-raising (ICO, IEO, etc.). It is speculative in nature and arbitrarily defined. This is in contrast to a hard cap, which is the maximum possible funding that a team is looking to collect. If a team is unable to raise funds beyond its soft cap limit, it sometimes returns the funds to its investors, while others continue to develop the project with the money that they collected.</div>
<div>Soft caps are not strictly enforced since they are simply a general idea of the amount that a cryptocurrency startup/organization is expecting to raise for a project. It is typically considered good practice for teams to inform any potential investors as to why they need this amount and what they would be using it for. However, they aren’t entirely necessary, since many teams have managed to raise funds without defining a soft cap. </div>
<p>Analyzing ICO metrics such as soft caps is also a way to gauge a team's experience and understanding of what they are trying to accomplish. For instance, investors should be wary of abnormally low and high soft cap values, which signal both the team's inexperience and are potential red flags regarding its legitimacy. On the other hand, a well-defined and properly-conveyed justification of the soft caps shows a team’s experience and legitimacy.</p>

<preview>A protocol upgrade where only previously valid transactions are made invalid, with most soft forks requiring miners to upgrade their mining software.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Soft Fork (Blockchain)?</h2>
<div>A soft fork refers to the changes applied to a blockchain for modifying or adding any functionality without causing any fundamental structural change. It ends further validity of older transactions or blocks for the network participants (nodes) who have decided to follow the new consensus rules. However, it still allows the nodes following the old consensus rules to consider newer transactions or blocks as valid. Therefore, a soft fork is backward-compatible, which is its differentiating characteristic with the more commonly known hard fork, which ends forward compatibility for all old consensus-following nodes. </div>
<div>One salient part of cryptocurrency soft forks is that they don’t need all miners on the network to agree to run the new code, it can be implemented with the majority of the miners agreeing on it. This allows network upgrades to be carried out faster and avoid causing a significant rift in the community. It can also be a result of a miner's mistakes if the old nodes violate new rules that they aren’t aware of. The only way to reverse a soft fork is through a hard fork. </div>
<div>Bitcoin and Ethereum's blockchains have, over the years, enacted several soft forks in order to upgrade the network, fix issues or enhance functionality, without taking the more contentious hard fork route of forcing all miners to agree on the new consensus rules, which would run the risk of splitting the network. A commonly known and typical example of a soft fork is the Bitcoin Segwit upgrade, which allows for block capacity increase by removing signature data from the transactions.</div>

<title>Soft Peg</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/soft-peg</url>
<file>soft-peg.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>In finance, a soft peg is a method of keeping the value of a currency within a certain range against a reserve currency by using an exchange rate regime.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Soft Peg?</h2>
<div>The soft peg method is an exchange rate regime applied to a currency that stabilizes its value against a pegged currency or reserve currency. The other peg approaches are hard peg and flexible peg. The primary difference between soft and hard peg is that soft peg allows for limited flexibility in the monetary policy. The goal is to enable governments to deal with fluctuations. </div>
<div>Peg is a monetary policy tool that allows a currency's value to be fixed relative to another currency or a commodity. In cryptocurrency, pegging is used to maintain stability in the market against fluctuations. The soft peg method allows some fluctuation between the value of the pegged cryptocurrency and its peg. The hard peg method does not allow for any fluctuation and the value of the pegged cryptocurrency remains exactly equal to its peg at all times.</div>
<p>The most famous soft-pegged currency is the Chinese Yuan, which was pegged to the Dollar from 1994 until 2005. Under the soft-pegging system, Yuan's value was allowed to move within a narrow band around its fixed target value. After 2005, China revalued its currency to appreciate 2.1% against the Dollar.</p>
<p>The soft peg system should not be confused with &quot;free-floating,&quot; where a currency is not tied to another currency.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using the Soft Peg Method</h2>
<div>Soft pegging can bring stability and predictability to foreign exchange markets. It especially benefits countries with highly volatile currencies or currencies that have high inflation rates. For example, the Chinese government used soft pegging to stabilize its economy during periods of high inflation and prevent it from trading too far below its official exchange rate.</div>
<p>Tether is an example of a cryptocurrency that uses both hard and soft pegs. It has a hard peg of $1 USD and a soft peg that allows it to move up or down by 2%.</p>
<p>In modern-day cryptocurrency markets, soft pegs are common. Bitcoin has historically been relatively volatile compared to fiat currencies, such as the US dollar. This means that its value rose and fell dramatically at times. This suits traders who want to capitalize on short-term price movements, but it poses problems for those who want their cryptocurrency to be useful as an everyday tender: if you receive $100 worth of bitcoin today, what will it be worth tomorrow?</p>
<div>Soft pegs aim to solve this problem by tying cryptocurrencies closely to more stable fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or gold. By fixing its value in this way, it becomes possible for people to use their crypto tokens as their everyday currency.</div>

<title>Software Library</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/software-library</url>
<file>software-library.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A software library is a collection of code that can be referenced while developing other executable programs.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Software Library?</h2>
<p>The software library is a term used to describe a collection of programming routines, functions, and other code snippets. Reusability of the code is the main idea behind these collections that prevents people from reinventing the wheel every time they create a new program. There are multiple types of libraries available where some focus on graphics or data manipulation, others specialize in input/output or general-purpose programming tasks.</p>
<div>Each function in a library serves a very specific purpose. For example, the CSS library helps designers use styles without designing and developing all design elements from scratch. JavaScript libraries allow developers to write more compact and efficient code for their scripts.</div>
<h2>External Libraries Works Like Rest of the Code</h2>
<div>It is a well-documented fact that computers can't understand anything except 1s and 0s. Each line of code written somewhere in any language will eventually run on a machine, and thus it will have to be converted into binary. From a simple hello-world program to a complex application of millions of lines, a flawless execution must address numerous issues like interdependencies and memory allocation. A whole process runs underneath that converts the code of a high-level language (HLL) into an executable binary file. Firstly, the compiler compiles the HLL source code into assembly source code and assigns unique symbols to the functions of external libraries, i.e., printf() in C library. These symbols are known as relocation information. </div>
<p>In the second phase, the assembler converts the assembly code into binary object files that have separate portions for relocation information. In the last phase, the linker looks for relocation information and fills the gaps with actual machine-readable binary code instead of symbols. Then, it makes an executable file that the computer runs to give the result. After compiling the code, the loader part begins where the memory allocation happens, and the operating system interacts with the program.</p>
<div>Libraries are an essential part of computer programming. Some of them are visible, while others aren't visible to the programmer who is writing the code. Usually, the available ones are code generation, static, and dynamic libraries. Code generation libraries are special tools that read the unique external or internal configurations related to the program and feed that information to the compiler. These are necessary for the compiler. Then there are static or compile-time libraries. During the compilation, the procedure linker searches for relocation information about these static libraries and then converts it into an executable file. After static libraries, there are dynamic libraries or runtime libraries. These libraries only come into play at run time when memory allocation and interaction with the OS happens. These are system libraries, and at a given time, multiple other programs can use them; thus, they are also known as shared libraries.</div>
<p>This process of converting HLL into an executable file and using code generation, static, or dynamic libraries happens in every such industry where software is reshaping people's lives.</p>
<h2>Libraries Are Making Crypto Development Easier</h2>
<p>In a blockchain-based ecosystem, development isn’t possible without using libraries. Nowadays the majority of new crypto projects are dependent on Ethereum, the largest blockchain-based ecosystem. In this ecosystem, there are libraries like web3.js and ethereum.js that make integration of the front end of dApps a lot easier. Without these libraries, everything will have to be built from scratch which will be a very tedious and costly task.</p>
<p>In Ethereum’s ecosystem, these libraries are developed differently from the other software-based solutions as they are deployed as smart contracts. It preserves the central idea of the reusability of code.</p>

<title>Software Stack</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/software-stack</url>
<file>software-stack.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Software stack refers to a set of software products or components that work together to provide a particular function.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Software Stack?</h2>
<p> The software stack is a term used by engineers to describe the different layers that are used in software development. For example, an internet browser uses a web server to display websites and a computer's operating system to send and receive data. </p>
<p>Each layer of a software stack may interact with one or more layers below it, and one or more layers above it. The most common example is the one that's used to access the internet. You use a web browser to send data over the Internet Protocol (IP) network, which is in turn transported by the transmission control protocol (TCP). TCP sits atop the internet layer of the internet protocol suite, which sits atop the network access layer, which sits atop Ethernet.</p>
<p>Each layer must work perfectly to execute the function, which is to browse the internet via a web browser.</p>
<h2>Difference Between a Software Stack and a Technology Stack</h2>
<div>A software platform is a system foundation upon which applications are built. This can include hardware, operating systems, programming languages, libraries, and frameworks. A technology stack refers to technologies used by an organization to create or support its products or services. A technology stack usually consists of three layers: hardware, operating system, and middleware.</div>
<p>On the other hand, a software stack includes all software components that support an application. It includes programming languages, coding frameworks, web servers, client interface tools, runtime environment, database tools, and more.</p>
<h2>Some Examples of Software Stack </h2>
<p>The LAMP stack is one of the most common stacks used in web development today. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python. This stack is used on more than 25 percent of all Internet websites and is one of the most popular choices among developers because it's free and open-source.</p>
<p>MAMP is a software stack for macOS or Windows that allows you to quickly and easily set up a web server. With the Apache Web Server, MySQL relational database management system, and PHP, you can run your own dynamic websites on your computer. MAMP is a great solution for anyone wanting to get started developing their own website from scratch, without having to install software on a remote server or rent/buy server space.</p>
<p>MEAN is a development stack that uses MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js. The acronym stands for four open-source technologies that make up this full-stack software solution.</p>
<p>The type of stack an application architect uses depends on the specific needs and requirements of the project. Each software stack offers a unique set of upsides and downsides in development. </p>

<preview>A software wallet, also known as a wallet app, is an application that allows users to HODL, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Software Wallet?</h2>
<div>A software wallet, also known as a wallet app, is an application that allows users to HODL, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Blockchains technically store cryptocurrencies on-chain, while software wallets provide an easy way to interact with blockchains via a graphical user interface (GUI). Software wallets can usually be broken down into three categories: web wallets, desktop wallets, and mobile wallets.</div>
<div>Like most other categories of crypto wallets, software wallets are usually non-custodial. This means no central platform or third party has custody of cryptocurrencies belonging to a particular wallet. Only the end user of a particular wallet has the ability to move funds using private keys.</div>
<div>Software wallets, which can be installed on any device, are encrypted and require a password to access a user’s coins. These types of wallets are oftentimes connected to a cryptocurrency exchange. Some software wallets even support non-custodial decentralized exchanges that use automated market makers (AMMs) or atomic swaps to facilitate cryptocurrency trading. </div>
<div>The advantages of software wallets include being more accessible and convenient for users to buy, exchange, sell, and send cryptocurrencies. They also provide support for multiple crypto assets, which is commonly referred to as a multi-coin wallet. </div>
<div>Software wallets are generally easy to use on desktop, tablet, and mobile. Another benefit is that software wallets are free, unlike hardware wallets which are more secure but require users to purchase them. Software wallets generally store a user’s private keys within a secure location. A software wallet typically requires a user to safeguard a seed phrase that is usually a series of 12 or 24 randomly generated words.</div>
<div>A few of the most popular software wallets include AtomicDEX, Electrum, Exodus, and Guarda.</div>

<preview>The programming language used by Ethereum for developing smart contracts.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Solidity?</h2>
<div>Solidity is a high-level object-oriented programming language that is principally used for the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity is a great tool to write smart contracts, which are self-executing code that enable complex automated functions. The programming language interacts with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is the abstraction layer between the executing code and execution machine. It is influenced by the C++, Python and JavaScript languages.</div>
<div>It has to be compiled to low-level machine instructions, called Opcodes, since they aren’t directly compiled by the EVM. Solidity is easy to switch to and convenient to write code in, especially for those who have existing programming knowledge. Despite being initially proposed by Solidity and Polkadot founder Gavin Woods in 2014, it was developed by the Ethereum foundation and Solidity project team. </div>
<p>The programming language is statically-typed, which means it discourages type errors and syntax issues by verifying the program’s source code. Solidity also supports inheritance, user-defined complex objects and libraries. It has allowed developers to create novel types of complex and automated financial, gaming, auction-based, management and other applications. </p>
<div>But like any programming language, it has a couple of issues. First, the immutable nature of blockchain ensures that a smart contract once deployed can’t be taken down or modified in any way. It means that every single line of code has to be perfect or else it runs the risk of being hacked or exploited, since it exists as long as the Ethereum network does. Solidity is also vulnerable to reentrancy attacks and other security issues. It was designed during a time when the Ethereum network wasn’t deployed. Therefore, its design needs to be updated to keep up with today’s requirements.</div>

<preview>A collection of lines or computer-executable commands written in a high-level language is called a source code.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Source Code?</h2>
<p>Source code is a collection of code (text-based instructions) that result in a computer program written using a high-level programming language. Seemingly, it is a collection of words, letters, and symbols, etc.</p>
<p>In order to be executed by a computer, those instructions have to be translated from the high-level language (source code) into a machine language understood by computers. This translation is done by a compiler or an interpreter and is what makes programs executable. A program can be run by executing its compiled form, using an interpreter, or, for more complex tasks, by directly executing its source code.</p>
<p>The source code of a program is usually held in one or more text files containing a large number of lines of code. The exact format of this file varies from one programming language to another, but programs usually have one or more files named with the extension .c, .cpp, .CPP or .cxx (e.g., filename.c). In most cases the file name matches the name of the main function or method of the program and the content of the file consists exclusively of that function definition and related declarations and statements.</p>
<h2>Source Code vs Open Source</h2>
<p>The term &quot;source code&quot; refers to the fundamental code of a program. It may be written in a programming language like JavaScript or PHP, but it is still text that can be read by anyone.</p>
<div>An open-source software, on the other hand, is developed in a collaborative environment where the source code is available to everyone. The reason for this openness is so that users can see how the program works and other developers can modify it to create other programs.</div>
<p>Open-source software, also known as free/libre open-source software (FLOSS), is software that can be copied, modified, distributed, and shared because its source code is available to the public for free. </p>
<p>Open-source software is the most prominent example of open-source development and is often compared to (commercial) closed-source software, which has the source code hidden from the users.</p>
<h2>Why Is It Important to Have Your Source Code?</h2>
<p>The purpose of having the source code is to allow you to edit it yourself whenever you need to make changes. Having your source code ensures the best possible protection of your product. It is the only way to ensure that you get all the latest updates and security patches. </p>
<p>It is also an important safety factor when you want to transfer a license to a new owner or if you want to make a backup.</p>
<p>The source code is the heart of your app or website. Without it, you are at the mercy of the development firm that built the app or website. </p>

<preview>A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is formed by investors in order to publicly list an organization without going through the troubles that come with the traditional IPO process.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a SPAC?</h2>
<div>A SPAC, or a special purpose acquisition company, is a company set up by investors with the purpose of raising money through an IPO (initial public offering). SPACs have no commercial operations and are formed with the purpose of acquiring an existing company. They are generally formed by a group of investors, known as “sponsors”, where they have the intention of pursuing deals in a particular industry. </div>
<p>The money SPACs raise in an IPO is locked in an interest-bearing trust account where it cannot be disbursed except to complete an acquisition or to return the money to investors if the SPAC is liquidated. They act as an interface between the public and businesses that often face challenges accessing funds. </p>
<div>SPACs are a popular way for companies to go public while avoiding the difficulties of a traditional IPO and ICOs, and without the strong market presence that direct listings require. They are faster and more convenient than IPOs and ICOs in that they allow projects and companies to get assurances from investors early on at an agreed-upon price, rather than the night before like traditional IPOs. Essentially, being acquired by a SPAC will offer business owners a faster IPO process under the guidance of an experienced partner.</div>

<title>Spear Phishing</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/spear-phishing</url>
<file>spear-phishing.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Spear phishing is a personalized, targeted cyber attack that uses your interest to trick you into clicking a malicious link in an email.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Spear Phishing?</h2>
<div>Spear phishing is a targeted attack that uses information from social media, work emails, and other sources to launch a one-on-one phishing attack against an individual.</div>
<p>Spear phishing is more dangerous than mass phishing because it uses your personal information (for example, your interest) to gain your trust. This technique is used mostly by cybercriminals to gather information about your organization so they can exploit vulnerabilities and cause maximum disruption.</p>
<div>The biggest threat of spear-phishing is the damage that it inflicts on the reputation of your business. Whether it's a fake CEO email asking for personal details, spoofing a supplier to gain access to their systems, or tricking staff into installing malware on their computer, every instance of spear-phishing can leave staff feeling anxious and vulnerable. In some cases, they get too embarrassed to admit that they fell for a scam, which means the issue could be overlooked and remain undetected for a long period of time.</div>
<h2>How to Save Yourself from Spear Phishing?</h2>
<p>Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing. If you receive an email from someone you barely know requesting sensitive personal information, don't give it out. These emails are usually not sent randomly. The sender may know the person they are trying to scam, including their personal details and interests. They might even know their phone number and address.</p>
<p>Spear phishing can also target people in an organization, such as employees in a particular department or company executives. These attackers usually pretend to be someone whom your business deals with on a regular basis, such as a supplier or customer. Therefore, you should open all types of emails with caution.</p>
<p>Here are some of the steps you can take to prevent spear phishing:</p>
<p>The foremost thing is to seek awareness regarding cyberattacks and phishing. Organizations need to ensure that they organized education and awareness programs for employees, teaching them how to spot strange links, protect passwords, use social media carefully, and identify suspicious emails.</p>
<p>To supplement awareness and education, ensure the use of solid email security software. Such software identifies and blocks phishing emails and other cyberattacks. </p>
<div>No matter how aware and cautious you are, there is a possibility that you will end up being its victim. It is always recommended to create a full backup of your data in an external hard drive, USB, or cloud storage.</div>
<p>Always use updated versions of software. Hackers constantly improve their methods to get access somehow, which is why it is crucial to ensure top-notch safety by regularly updating your software and installing new security patches.</p>

<title>Speculative Investment</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/speculative-investment</url>
<file>speculative-investment.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Speculative investment is an investment where the investor expects a high return with a significant risk of loss.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Speculative Investment?</h2>
<p>Speculative investment is the act of investing in an asset that has a high risk and reward ratio. If you are willing to take risks because you are expecting that you will gain more than what you invest, then you are engaging in speculative investments.</p>
<p>Speculators generally seek to profit from market price fluctuations through rapid trading. Some speculators look for undervalued securities, while others exploit what they believe to be overvalued markets for short-term gains. Speculation can in some cases be considered a form of gambling because it does not necessarily involve the fundamental value of a security and often little research into a security's background.</p>
<p>An example of speculative investment would be purchasing five shares of XYZ Company because you think that based on their current financial situation, XYZ Company will beat their earnings estimates next month and the stock price will rise as a result. </p>
<h2>How Does Investment Differ From Speculative Investment?</h2>
<p>Investing is putting your money into something that you know has value. Whether it is buying stocks or getting a property, you are making an investment for long-term gains by putting your trust in the value of that asset. You are investing because you believe that over time your investment will provide cash flow or appreciation, or both. </p>
<p>Speculating is something very different from investing. Speculation investments involve buying something with the hope that its price will go up without any regard to its underlying value. It is not enough to think that gold prices might go up; you have to know why will it go up and whether it is worth the risk.</p>
<h2>Is Investing in Cryptocurrency a Speculative Investment?</h2>
<p>Even since cryptocurrencies gained traction, the discussion about them being speculative investments or real investment opportunities is a hot topic.  </p>
<p>Controversy has swirled around the topic. Cryptocurrencies have been praised for their potential to revolutionize the world of finance and criticized for their volatility, so it is important to understand what value they really hold.</p>
<div>When Bitcoin was released, it was unclear whether the world even needs it or not. However, today it has become quite popular. When people finally saw the potential that cryptocurrency carried, they started launching more projects on the blockchain. </div>
<p>The bottom line is that whether or not cryptocurrency is a speculative investment depends on what you buy. Let’s say you invest in a high-quality project with long-term potential, you can certainly call it a safe investment. On the other hand, investing in a project with no use case and hoping that someone would buy it from you at a higher rate is what we can call speculative investment. </p>

<preview>A hard spoon is a meta-protocol that exists on top of a blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Spoon (Blockchain)?</h2>
<div>A spoon is a type of blockchain fork where the new cryptocurrency inherits the account balances of an existing cryptocurrency. It allows a new project to add its own features to the previous software, whilst still allowing the users of the existing protocol to participate in it. Projects spoon in order to attract users and developers of an established platform. They are more amicable than contentious in nature. However, they are very not common in the blockchain industry since their implementation isn’t exactly convenient. </div>
<div>A spoon differs from the more common hard fork by its nature and intention. Most hard forks are contentious, while spoons are collaboration-focused. Hard forks also use the same token as the existing chain, whilst spoons merely copy balances and use another custom token for their purposes. Furthermore, hard forks are designed to steal market share and dominance of an existing platform, while spoons complement the technical prowess of the projects they copy balances from.</div>
<div>Thanks to its large user base and developer community, Ethereum is the most used protocol for spooning. Typical examples include Athereum and Cosmos, both of which took snapshots of the Ethereum blockchain to note and port account balances on their new networks. Unsurprisingly, these networks are compatible with the Ethereum mainnet in various ways and also introduce their own improvements/functionalities to it. But despite copying balances, they have their own tokens and don’t use ETH.</div>

<description>
<h2>What is Spot Trading?</h2>
<div>Spot trading involves the immediate exchange of a financial instrument at the current price. A spot trade is the most common type of trade in crypto and forex, where two coins are traded against each other. In addition to cryptocurrency pairs, spot trading includes commodities, bonds, and stocks.</div>
<p>Spot trading refers to the price of an asset at the time of sale or purchase, rather than a future price for an asset as in a futures contract. The standard settlement period for a spot trade is two days from the date the transaction occurs in a traditional market.</p>
<p>Spot trades are usually settled within two business days of purchase and are deemed to be more speculative because they involve more risk than transactions conducted on the forward market. They are also subject to greater volatility due to their short-term nature and high liquidity levels in comparison to the forward market; therefore their prices tend to fluctuate more rapidly than other trades.</p>
<h2>Spot Market</h2>
<div>A spot market is a cash market where immediate buying and selling of goods occurs. The prices fluctuate daily as a result of changes in supply and demand for particular goods.</div>
<div>The spot market can be contrasted with the futures market, which is defined by contracts made on the trading floor of a futures exchange. Such contracts are legally binding and are usually settled through an organized clearinghouse. The futures market allows investors to hedge against the risk of adverse price movements in an asset class.</div>
<p>In foreign exchange markets, the current exchange rate of a currency pair is called the spot exchange rate.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Spot Trading </h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency spot trading means buying and selling a cryptocurrency for immediate settlement, so you can realize your profits or losses quickly, rather than waiting for the value to fluctuate over time.</p>
<div>Most exchanges support spot trading and some offer margin trading services as well. Margin trading is another term for leveraged trading — in other words, borrowing money to buy more of an asset than you'd be able to buy with just the cash in your account.</div>
<div>Spot trades are typically done using digital wallets, which are software programs that are encrypted with private keys. This is where you store the currency you're going to buy or sell on the exchange. The exchange either has its own proprietary wallet that you use, or it supports one of several common third-party wallets (like Metamask or MyEtherWallet).</div>
<p>Unlike stock exchanges, cryptocurrency exchanges are open 24/7. This means you can spot trade your cryptocurrency at any time, day or night. </p>
<div>Crypto spot trading has many benefits but like any other kind of trading, it’s also not risk-free. If you intend to enter crypto spot trading, it is advised that you gather some essential knowledge and trade with caution. Make sure you invest only the amount you can afford to lose. The key here is selecting a crypto exchange with a high level of liquidity as it reduces risk to an extent. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Spyware?</h2>
<p>Spyware is a type of malware programmed to record every activity that goes on in an infected device and relay it to a snooper. Spyware’s main purpose is to track a person’s activity online and harvest as much information from them so that it can be used for the hacker’s personal gain, such as selling data to marketers or identity fraud. </p>
<p>There are several types of spyware such as adware, trojans, keyloggers, tracking cookies and system monitors that perform specific functions and record a set of information without the knowledge and consent of the target. Commonly, spyware is distributed to unsuspecting users by way of infected websites, which can either be acquired via emails, random pop-up browsers or ads. Furthermore, downloading files online can also infect a device with spyware. </p>
<div>Spyware is detrimental to crypto users since this malware could potentially steal their private keys, allowing hackers to steal funds. Unlike in credit or debit cards, transactions that involve stolen cryptocurrencies cannot be reversed due to blockchain’s immutable nature.</div>

<preview>A cryptocurrency with extremely low volatility, sometimes used as a means of portfolio diversification. Examples include gold-backed cryptocurrency or fiat-pegged cryptocurrency.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Stablecoin?</h2>
<div>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with a fixed value that’s usually  pegged to a leading fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, a basket or fiat currencies or exchange-traded commodity such as precious metals. </div>
<div>‍Stablecoins serve as a much-needed antidote to price volatility in the cryptocurrency markets. </div>
<p>Stablecoin currencies are collateralized by an underlying asset ,usually the one it digitally represents, in order to deliver the same price stability as fiat currencies.  </p>
<div>A stablecoin such as Tether (USDT) is backed by the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis. For every single unit of USDT that's in circulation, $1 is supposed to be set aside and held in reserve by its issuer Tether Ltd, which is controlled by the founders of the crypto exchange Bitfinex.</div>
<div>The number of stablecoins out there has exploded in recent years — as well as the quantity. It's also possible to find crypto assets that are pegged to other fiat currencies such as the euro, and even other crypto assets! </div>
<div>Broadly speaking, there are 4 types of stablecoins:</div>
<div>It seems that the possibilities are endless with this new technology. Some stablecoin projects have tied their digital assets to precious metals, or other cryptocurrencies. Projects such as Facebook's failed Libra (now Diem) intended to allow stablecoins to be used as a medium of exchange — backed by a basket of different national currencies. </div>
<div>Stablecoins are exceedingly easy to buy and are listed on most cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase. In short, they provide welcome liquidity and safe harbour for crypto investors and are an integral part of the digital assets space. While new stablecoin-focused regulations are always rumored to be incoming, they are still tolerated by authorities worldwide due to their usually high compliance with financial legislative requirements. Stablecoins have almost certainly provided the inspiration and playbook for central bank digital currencies (CBDC).</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is A Staking Pool?</h2>
<div>When used in reference to the participation mechanism in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus network, a staking pool is simply the combination of all the assets contributed by multiple stakeholders to unify their staking power. In PoS networks, decision-making or computational power is directly linked to the number of assets held. Staking power is proportional to the percentage of total assets that have been staked.</div>
<div>Since most network participants rarely have significant resources to stake on their own, individually, many prefer to contribute their power to a staking pool. These pools typically have their own administrator or pool operators,  who are the ones responsible for keeping the nodes/validators operating. </div>
<div>Participants in a staking pool lock (stake) their assets into the pool, and are not able to use them until they redeem them or the expiry of the staking term arrives (in case of locked savings). Such a process increases the security of the network and verifies and validates new blocks. Stakers are rewarded with a share of earnings from block rewards.</div>
<div>Naturally, the more you stake, the higher chance you have of being rewarded. Most staking pools also incentivize more frequent and longer staking periods: the longer you keep your assets in the pool, the higher your likelihood of earning rewards or the more your share of any eventual rewards will be. These rewards are typically estimated and expressed in APY.</div>
<h2>DeFi Staking Pools</h2>
<div>In decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, staking pools (sometimes called savings) work in a similar manner, however, these pools are project-specific and use native tokens for their protocols. For example,  PancakeSwap (a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) protocol) features CAKE (its native token) staking pools. However, it also hosts multiple staking pools for projects available on BSC.</div>
<div>A secondary purpose of these staking pools is to lock liquidity into the protocols, ensuring that there are enough resources in terms of assets to meet the DeFi needs. </div>
<p>Rewards in these DeFi pools also include a share of revenue generated from the different protocols (like fees and commissions). This is part of the reason why APY percentages in DeFi staking pools can be much higher than regular PoS staking pools.</p>
<p>In both cases, staking pool investors do face certain risks. The most significant is adverse price movement in the staked assets possibly negating the APY earned. For example, earning 40% APY but experiencing a 50% price drop over the period of one year puts you at a net loss.</p>

<preview>A stochastic oscillator is a popular technical indicator used for identifying overbought and oversold stock/asset/cryptocurrency levels that rely on an asset's price history, as it tend to fl</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Stochastic Oscillator?</h2>
<div>Stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that is used to determine the time of entry and exit in a trade depending on whether the fundamental financial instrument is overbought or oversold. </div>
<div>The concept of stochastics was created by Dr. George Lane in the 1950s, which involved comparing the current price to a price range for a specific amount of time.</div>
<div>The stochastic oscillator displays the position of a stock's closing price in respect to its high and low range over (generally) 14 days. According to Lane, the stochastic oscillator does not change in relation to price, volume, or other factors, rather Lane claims that the oscillator tracks the price's pace or momentum.</div>
<p>The graph of a stochastic oscillator usually consists of two lines, named K and D: </p>
<div>The crossing of these two lines is taken as an indication that a reversal is imminent, as it shows a significant movement in momentum on a day-to-day basis.</div>
<h2>Why Is Stochastic Indicator Used?</h2>
<div>The stochastic indicator is used to gauge the ongoing market sentiment. It is programmed to provide values between 0 and 100, with readings closer to 0 suggesting a bearish condition and readings closer to 100 indicating a bullish state. Unlike other crypto trading indicators, the stochastic indicator does not show negative readings or numbers greater than 100.</div>
<div>Stock/Crypto traders commonly utilize the numbers 20 and 80 as key thresholds. Any values below 20 imply that the market is oversold, while anything above 80 suggests that it is overbought. Keep in mind that the indicator still shows overbought or oversold circumstances when it reaches values much above or below 80 and 20. It may not always imply that a reversal is taking place.</div>
<div>As mentioned above, divergences occur when the Stochastic Oscillator fails to establish a new price high or low. A bullish divergence occurs when the price makes a lower low while the Stochastic Oscillator produces a higher low which indicates a decrease in negative momentum, which might indicate a good turn. When the price makes a higher high while the Stochastic Oscillator makes a lower high, this is known as a bearish divergence.</div>
<h2>What Is the Best Setting for a Stochastic Oscillator? </h2>
<p>The ideal settings for Stochastic Oscillator is the following: </p>
<h2>Stochastic Oscillator Formula</h2>
<p>Here’s how you can calculate the Stochastic Oscillator:</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>H14 = Highest price during the last 14 periods</p>
<p>%K Slowing Period = The current value of stochastic indicator3</p>
<p>C = Latest closing price</p>
<p>L14 = Lowest prices during the last 14 periods</p>
<div>Price momentum oscillators (technical indicators) such as the relative strength index (RSI), MACD, on-balance volume, aroon indicator, and the stochastic oscillator are frequently used in technical analysis by crypto traders and financial experts. Even though they are frequently employed together, they have separate underlying ideas and techniques. </div>
<div>For example, comparing RSI with stochastic oscillator, it can be noticed that the stochastic oscillator works on the assumption that closing prices should reflect the current market trend. Meanwhile, the RSI measures the velocity of price changes to identify overbought and oversold levels. The RSI is generally more beneficial in growing markets, whereas stochastics are more helpful in sideways or turbulent markets.</div>

<preview>A stop-loss order in trading allows investors to determine the lowest price at which they are willing to sell an asset and trigger an automatic sell order when and if this price is reached.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is a stop-loss order?</h2>
<div>A stop-loss order is one of the most useful tools investors have to limit the amount of losses on their investments. Both stocks and cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that change in price constantly. In order to limit the amount of loss traders can possibly go through, many exchanges and trading services offer stop-loss orders. </div>
<div>The way a stop-loss order works is simple. Traders have the opportunity to set up a minimum price for the assets in their portfolio. Once this minimal price is reached, the exchange automatically triggers a sell order to limit the losses for the trader. Stop-loss orders are extremely helpful, especially when investing in cryptocurrencies that are traditionally more volatile. Traders usually set up stop-loss orders on prices higher than what they bought the crypto tokens for to still realize a gain, even if the value of the token is falling. </div>
<div>Bearish periods like the one major tokens Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced towards the middle of 2021 call for an increased number of stop-loss orders. While the price of the two tokens was going up for a while, in May 2021, the trend reversed. One of the surefire ways to prevent a significant loss in such periods is through a stop-loss order. By placing a stop-loss order at a price point that still allows you to make a profit, investors eliminate the chance to lose significant amounts of money.</div>
<p>One of the main benefits of stop-loss orders is the fact that they give investors the opportunity to not monitor stocks or crypto tokens every second of the day. A stop-loss order gives the investor the security that an automatic sell order will be activated once a certain price has been reached. In this sense, traders set up stop-loss orders and don’t have to worry about monitoring their assets in case the price is going down. Not to mention that, a stop-loss order can help an investor still take out gains, as it can be placed on a price that is above the price an asset was purchased for. </p>
<p>Stop-loss orders are one of the most important tools which traders have to protect themselves against extreme volatility in the price of their assets. In cryptocurrency, a stop-loss order is capable of preventing losses on tokens which experience high fluctuations in price. </p>

<title>Storage (Decentralized)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/storage-decentralized</url>
<file>storage-decentralized.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Decentralized storage refers to the concept of storing files online by splitting them into encrypted fragments and delegating these fragments to multiple nodes on a distributed network, e.g.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Decentralized Storage?</h2>
<div>The concept of decentralized storage was pioneered in 2013-2015 by projects such as the (InterPlanetary File System) IPFS, Storj and Siacoin. The main idea behind the concept is to leverage the advantages associated with decentralized networks in order to improve privacy, security, censorship resistance, cost and availability of file storage systems.</div>
<p>Decentralized storage should not be confused with cloud storage, which is the storing of files remotely on servers operated by a single service provider like Google Drive or Amazon Drive. </p>
<p>A cloud storage provider’s data stores are centralized, meaning that they also act as a single point of failure: they can experience downtime or be attacked by hackers, leading to lower availability or even loss of stored data. They are also managed by a private entity, allowing it to restrict access to specific customers and censor data.</p>
<p>Decentralized storage systems, on the other hand, split user files into several encrypted fragments and delegate their storage to multiple participants of a geographically and organizationally distributed network, such as a blockchain. This is theorized to lead to a number of advantages, e.g.:‍</p>
<p>- The distribution of multiple redundant copies of file fragments leads to increased security and privacy: even if some nodes on the network become compromised, files can still be retrieved from the remaining nodes;</p>
<p>- Increased censorship resistance due to the fact that no single entity is in charge of the network;</p>
<p>- Increased uptime resulting from data download being available from multiple network nodes, most of which are online at any given moment.</p>

<title>Storage Miners</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/storage-miners</url>
<file>storage-miners.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Storage miners are cryptocurrency miners who rely on offering sufficient storage space for nodes to reach consensus and validate transactions.</preview>
<description>
<div>Mining in the cryptocurrency world is one of the most important processes. Depending on the consensus mechanism a blockchain utilizes, there are different types of mining. Storage mining is one of the numerous types of cryptocurrency mining.</div>
<h2>What are storage miners?</h2>
<p>Storage mining is a type of cryptocurrency mining that allows miners to receive rewards for storing data on their personal servers or devices. One of the main concepts of storage mining is that miners have to dedicate a certain amount of storage space to become eligible to be a node of the blockchain network.</p>
<div>One of the most notable cryptocurrencies that depends on storage mining in its operations is Filecoin. The Filecoin blockchain relies on the storage capacity of its miners in order to select eligible nodes. These nodes then serve as transaction verifiers and miners of new blocks which are added to the chain. </div>
<div>Entrusting the node-selection process to a storage-based consensus mechanism is somewhat experimental in the cryptocurrency industry. Most popular blockchains rely on either proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. However, blockchains like Filecoin utilize storage power as a measure for node eligibility. Node validators are selected based on the amount of storage power they can offer to the network. In return, nodes or storage miners receive mining rewards. In the case of Filecoin, storage miners receive FIL tokens for successful block creation. </div>
<p>The storage that miners dedicate to the network is utilized by users of the Filecoin blockchain and system. This is why the consensus mechanism requires all approved notes to be able to prove that they have the storage power needed and that they have an updated copy of the whole system on their servers at all times. </p>
<p>Interestingly, storage miners can choose whether they would like to dedicate cloud storage or hardware storage. This makes it incredibly easy for storage miners to acquire additional storage power and move up in node rankings.</p>
<p>Storage-based consensus mechanisms are rarely utilized in the blockchain industry, however, Filecoin is proof that this system can be successful. Not only that, the highly customizable requirements regarding the type of storage power requested by the network allow storage miners a significant amount of flexibility. This flexibility in node requirements is not usually present in more established consensus mechanisms. </p>

<title>Store of Value</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/store-of-value</url>
<file>store-of-value.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A store of value is an asset, commodity or currency that can be saved, retrieved as well as exchanged in the future without it losing any value.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Store of Value?</h2>
<p>A store of value can be an asset or currency, as well as a commodity. Many commodities are actually products that maintain their value throughout a prolonged period of time. An item can be considered as a store of value if its value is either stable or can increase over time, but does not depreciate. Gold, as well as other precious metals, are a good store of value due to the fact that their shelf lives are perpetual. A nation's currency has to be a reasonable store of value for its economy to be able to function smoothly.</p>
<p>Let's look at another example, such as milk. This is a poor store of value, due to the fact that, when it decays, it will essentially become worthless. You can say the same thing about any product that depreciates in value over time.</p>
<p>Many economies throughout our history have actually used metals such as gold and silver due to the fact that they can store value, and their relative ease of transport proved to be a convenience. The United States used to be on a gold standard, which meant that dollars were redeemable for a specific weight of gold up until 1971.</p>
<p>In fact, what comprises a store of value can be markedly different throughout countries and cultures, and in most areas of the world, specifically the more advanced economies out there, the local currency can be counted on as a store of value in almost all case scenarios.</p>

<file>subgraph-manifest.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A component of Subgraph that entails information pertaining to subgraph’s data sources, templates, and more.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Subgraph Manifest?</h2>
<p>The subgraph manifest is the file that defines how specific data gets mapped from the Ethereum network to The Graph. It is written in YAML and contains the following fields:</p>
<div>Name: The name of the subgraph. </div>
<div>Description: A brief description of what the subgraph is about. This will be displayed in the explorer UI to give users context around what they are looking at.</div>
<div>Data Sources: An array of data source IDs pointing to specific Ethereum networks and smart contract addresses. These provide mappings between on-chain events and fields on entities. This is where we define which smart contracts will contribute data to this subgraph, which specific events they emit, and how those events map onto a GraphQL schema defined elsewhere in this manifest.</div>
<div>The Subgraph Manifest is a structured way to specify the entities, relationships, and indexing needed for your graph. It is used by The Graph CLI to deploy your subgraph as well as by dApp developers on The Graph at query time.</div>
<p>Subgraphs are open-sourced data schemas that define how an application should store data in a decentralized database called a Graph Node. Subgraph manifests are written in GraphQL SDL and are used by Graph Nodes to create indexes of an entire blockchain and its smart contracts.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a subgraph using the graph-node command-line tool or the graph-node docker image. However, only curated subgraphs can be deployed on the public network of The Graph</p>
<div>The Graph is used as a protocol to build dApps faster using GraphQL. These dApps are primarily built on Ethereum and IPFS.</div>
<p>The Graph consists of a set of subgraphs, where each subgraph describes the data requirements for an application. Subgraphs can be composed together to create more complex applications. Every subgraph has an associated manifest that describes the data requirements of the subgraph along with other metadata about the subgraph.</p>
<p>Everything is open-source, so anyone can create a subgraph starting with a template or by forking an existing one.</p>
<p>Other than Manifest, Subgraph has two other components:</p>
<div>Schema: This defines what data you want to index in your graph. It is very similar to the type definitions in GraphQL and uses the same schema language.</div>
<div>Mapping: This defines how you want to map your Ethereum data into the graph using The Graph Query Language (GQL).</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Substrate?</h2>
<div>Substrate is a web app development framework developed by Parity Technologies that allows software developers to create decentralized systems. Substrate features a secure and scalable blockchain logic, a rich user experience for any chain, compatibility with the Polkadot ecosystem and support for other smart contract platforms such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</div>
<p>Substrate showcases an efficient database that developers can take advantage of in running and maintaining blockchain-based applications. It also supports a modular peer-to-peer networking stack capable of faster transaction throughput between blockchain networks and their participants. Moreover, it offers functions that can be configured according to the needs of an application, including transaction queues and runtime libraries.</p>
<p>Projects built using the Substrate can be easily deployed on the Polkadot ecosystem, helping them take advantage of the growing network for wider application adoption. Substrate also works flawlessly with any browser or desktop device.</p>
<p>As of now, Polkadot is one of the largest blockchain projects that utilize Substrate as the backbone of their network since it is the first protocol built on its framework. It needs to be noted that Substrate is not part of Polkadot and that anyone can build new blockchains that have nothing to do with the Polkadot blockchain. However, their DApps would still be compatible with Polkadot since they are built on the same framework. By and large, Substrate has been utilized mostly to build projects that advance the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A supercomputer is a superior version of a general-purpose computer, which has a significantly increased capacity and processing power.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is a supercomputer?</h2>
<p>The first supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s by Control Data Corporation. Seymour Cray is credited with developing the first supercomputer, capable of outputting more computations than traditional general-purpose computers. At the time, supercomputers were not as widely utilized as they are at present.</p>
<div>Supercomputers generally differ from traditional household computers by their processing power and the number of operations they can carry out in a second. In other words, supercomputers have better GPUs and CPUs. The power of a supercomputer is calculated in FLOPS, which stands for floating-point operations per second. Currently, the most powerful supercomputers are capable of performing at a speed of one hundred quadrillion FLOPS.</div>
<p>Nowadays, supercomputers have an important role in the technological advancements we are experiencing. One of the more noticeable uses of supercomputers that people might not even know about is weather prediction. Meteorologists rely on supercomputers to process huge amounts of data from all over the world to provide as accurate a prognosis as possible. Because of the numerous data points meteorology utilizes, supercomputers prove extremely valuable in predicting weather conditions on a global scale.</p>
<p>Governments all over the world are looking to invest in the development of supercomputers. There is a worldwide competition going on between countries to be the next one to create the best supercomputer so far. In 2017, China, the United States, and the European Union were competing against each other to create the first-ever computer capable of processing one quintillion FLOPS. </p>
<div>Supercomputers also play an important role in the development of blockchain-based projects. One notable example is IBM’s supercomputer which helps process information for the computer giant’s blockchain-based projects.</div>
<div>Because of the remarkable computational power supercomputers possess, such machines often become targets for hackers. Infamously, one of the main reasons hackers try to take control over supercomputers is to mine cryptocurrency. The enormous processing power, along with increased productivity, make supercomputers the perfect mining machine.</div>
<p>Even with the serious competition for the next best development, supercomputers still have a long way to go. According to experts, a supercomputer capable of processing one sextillion FLOPS will be required for the complete weather modeling of the world for two weeks. Currently, such technology does not exist. While supercomputers still have a long way to go, they prove to be an essential part of our digital development already. </p>

<file>supply-and-demand.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Supply and demand are the levels in an economy that determine the market's willingness to buy or sell assets or services, respectively.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Supply and Demand?</h2>
<p>Supply and demand can be thought of as the governing forces of a market economy, which are moderated through prices. It defines the relationship between a given product or assets and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it. </p>
<p>Supply is the amount of material, asset, product, or service that is available to the economy. It is not so much about how much exists, but rather how much of it people can get. </p>
<p>Demand is the requirement for products and services. It is used to determine the number or ratio of people who are interested in the items/services offered by an organization, and the amount of money they are willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>When institutions or influential buyers gain access to an asset, we can clearly see the market response.  Bitcoin is an example of a scarce asset that has introduced a motion in the field of finance by demonstrating the immense benefits of having a digital asset with a limited and finite supply. As Bitcoin increases in demand, the more valuable it becomes. </p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A supply chain is the collection of steps that a product or service needs to go through before reaching the final customer.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is a supply chain?</h2>
<p>In simple terms, a supply chain is the list of steps that a service, product, or commodity goes through before reaching the final customer base. These steps vary in number for different productions. The supply chain includes everything from sourcing the raw materials to their preparation and manipulation in factories and other establishments. Once a finished product is ready, the supply chain continues with distribution and sales. Distribution of the product can be local, national, or international, but all of the endpoints where this product will go are part of the supply chain. Lastly, the supply chain involves any third-party companies that buy the product in order to resell it. </p>
<p>In essence, a supply chain is a detailed roadmap of how a service, product, or commodity makes it from scratch to its final destination in a customer’s home. Depending on the product, a supply chain can consist of as few as two steps. However, nowadays, more often than not, supply chains comprise thousands of steps, which makes following the development of a product extremely hard. </p>
<div>This is where blockchain technology and cryptocurrency come in handy. Big names in the computer industry like IBM are continuously experimenting with blockchain technology in order to create seamless supply chains for various businesses and industries. One of the most important things blockchain brings to supply chain management is security. Distributed ledgers are immutable, which means that once something is recorded in them, the information cannot be altered. This is extremely useful when it comes to recording transactions and storing information about sales and purchases.</div>
<div>Alternatively, cryptocurrency tokens can be used to boost the efficacy of delivery and tracking, which is another key component of a supply chain. Non-fungible tokens can be a perfect vehicle to create labels, which are then printed and attached to the goods that need to be delivered. As each NFT can be absolutely unique, items will become highly traceable, and losses across the supply chain will be minimized.</div>
<p>Blockchain technology proves to be extremely beneficial when it comes to optimizing supply chains. Nowadays, with huge international productions, supply chain management can become an increasingly lengthy process. Blockchains and crypto tokens can enhance the productivity and security of supply chains to make them more efficient. </p>

<file>supply-chain-attack.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A supply chain attack is a tactic used by hackers to compromise third-party suppliers to major corporations, governments and organizations to gain valuable information.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Supply Chain Attack?</h2>
<div>Supply chain attacks are increasingly prominent, with the latest high-profile Solar Winds attack in the United States in 2020. In this example, hackers (widely believed to be Russian) compromised a software provider used by Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and many more organizations. By attacking Solar Winds, the hackers could indirectly attack all of these entities indirectly. </div>
<p>By using a trojan horse update, the hackers gained access to a vast amount of sensitive and possibly top-secret information held by branches of the military, the state department, and the pentagon. The extent of the breach is still unknown and many estimate that it will take more than a year to recover and fully remove any threat of lingering surveillance. </p>
<p>The Solar Winds example is a classic case of how devastating a supply chain attack can be. Since so many modern operations rely on software and services from third-party suppliers like cybersecurity firms, it is increasingly difficult to keep systems safe. Supply chain attacks go beyond cybercrime and begin to enter the arena of cyber warfare. In the coming years, supply chain attacks could be used for extortion, surveillance and to gain control over sensitive networks.</p>

<h2>What Is a Swarm?</h2>
<p>Swarm is the word used to describe a group of peers sharing a torrent. There may be multiple swarms for one torrent. In some cases, peers create their own swarm. It is also possible to share a file yourself, but this is called &quot;seeding.”</p>
<p>A peer is an end-user or client who uses the BitTorrent protocol on their computer to download and upload torrents. Peers exchange information about torrents with each other over the internet for the purpose of sharing files via BitTorrent.</p>
<div>BitTorrent is a P2P (peer-to-peer) file-sharing protocol. It is a decentralized communications system based on the end-to-end principle. This means that there is no central point of failure or single point of control. There is no server, website, or centralized service that the clients communicate with; they can communicate only with each other.</div>
<p>The BitTorrent protocol allows only one swarm to share a file at any given time. You can think of a swarm as being similar to a conference call; everyone in the swarm shares the same conversation, and only one conversation can exist at any given time. In this case, the conversation is about the particular file being shared.</p>

<title>Swing Failure Pattern (SFP)</title>

<file>swing-failure-pattern-sfp.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A swing failure pattern (SFP) is a trend reversal indicator that can be used to discover a weakness in the current trend and identify early reversal signs.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Swing Failure Pattern (SFP)?</h2>
<div>Swing Failure Pattern (or SFP) is a type of reversal pattern in which (swing) traders target stop-losses above a key swing low or below a key swing high to push the price in the other direction by generating enough liquidity. </div>
<div>In an uptrend, there are repeated higher highs and higher lows but, at some point, the price fails to achieve a new high and, in a downtrend, prices fail to make a new low. This is a sign of a pattern shift.</div>
<div>The trendline must break through the previous high in a downtrend or the previous low in an uptrend for the pattern to be completed.</div>
<div>Traders utilize failure swings to plan their entry and exit. When a failure swing happens in an upswing, traders take a short position, and when a failure swing occurs in a downtrend, traders go long.</div>
<div>Experienced traders time their entrance to coincide with the creation of the second high before the failure swings in the downtrend.</div>
<div>The failure swing pattern provides an early warning of a trend reversal. Being able to detect it at an early stage will offer you a head start in planning a trade-off, which will benefit your portfolio.</div>
<div>The RSI failure swing is a great example to understand the SFP method. Introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the 1970s, the RSI failure swing helps in determining the change in price action and its momentum.</div>
<div>A relative strength index separation occurs when the price and the indicator split from each other, signaling a lack of trend momentum.</div>
<div>The same thing happens when an RSI failure swing occurs, with verification of trend shift on a breach of the indicator's fail point. To execute more verified trades, one might wait for a failed swing to appear on the charts.</div>
<div>When the price line and the RSI line separate from each other, this is referred to as a failure swing. It denotes a drop in prevailing strength, particularly when the market is overvalued or oversold.</div>
<div>In a bullish cycle, the market hits the highest possible level or the overbought limit before slipping down. It then gets up again but fails to climb above the previous high, causing the trendline to form an 'M' shape. This is the point at which the failure swing occurs. In the case of an uptrend, failure to hit a higher high indicates that the present uptrend is deteriorating. Similarly, in a bearish market, the reverse occurs. The second peak fails to hit the lowest low in the overselling region and climbs instead.</div>
<div>There are different types of failure swing patterns that traders use in the financial world. There are M-shaped, W-shaped failure swings, in addition to failure swing top, non-failure swing, failure swing bottom, and non-failure swing bottom. Learning these swing failure patterns in addition to famous technical indicators will help you in making an entry and exiting your positions at the right time in the stocks, cryptocurrencies, or any major financial arena.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Swing trading is a market trading technique that aims to profit from short to medium-term price changes in stocks, commodities, and/or currencies over a period of days or weeks.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Swing Trading?</h2>
<div>Swing trading is a trading technique in which investors acquire stocks or other assets and keep them for a short length of time, typically a few days to several weeks with the expectation of making a profit.</div>
<div>Swing traders must keep a close eye on their positions and transactions in order to be successful. Their risk-to-reward ratio is halfway between those of trend traders and day traders. Swing traders, for the most part, rely on charted technical indicators to find potential trading opportunities, despite the fact that technical analysis is often considered as an imprecise science.</div>
<div>The swing trader's objective is to profit from any potential price fluctuation, or &quot;swing,&quot; in the market. Individual profits may be less since traders are more focused on short-term trends and try to reduce losses as soon as possible. Small profits over time, on the other hand, can add up to a substantial yearly return.</div>
<div>The first step in swing trading success is selecting the appropriate stocks/currencies/asset for investment. Large-cap companies, which are one of the most frequently traded on the main exchanges, are the greatest prospects for swing traders. These stocks will fluctuate between widely defined high and low extremes in an active market, and the trader will ride a wave in one way for a few days or weeks before switching to the other side of the trade when the stocks change direction.</div>
<div>Swing trading is quite challenging in a market that is hanging between bears and bulls. Even the most active stocks will not display the very same up-and-down fluctuations as when indices are reasonably steady for a few weeks or months when the market is at these extremes. In either a bear or a bull market, movement will typically drive stocks in one direction for a long time, indicating that trading on the basis of the longer-term directional tendency is the best approach.</div>
<div>In the cryptocurrency world, countertrend techniques are more commonly used by swing traders to earn significant gains from price reversals near the trading range's edge. As a result, one of the keys to success is recognizing support and resistance levels. Successful traders search for chances on the 4-hour and daily charts, then utilize the 15-minute and 1-hour charts to identify a precise entry.</div>
<div>A common swing trading technique is &quot;buying the pullback.&quot; Breakouts of resistance levels frequently result in an increased buying activity. Traders who missed the dip can wait for a downturn and use limit orders to purchase near the first support level.</div>

<preview>Sybil attacks undermine an online network by creating many IDs, accounts or nodes to upset the balance of power.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Sybil Attack?</h2>
<p>Sybil attacks can be simple in nature, like setting up duplicate accounts on social media, or they can be complex, like operating multiple nodes on a blockchain system. Both of these tactics are designed to gain influence or power over a network. The name “Sybil” originates from a medical case study of a woman that had dissociative identity disorder. </p>
<div>In blockchain systems, a bad actor may attempt to disrupt a network’s power structure by gaining as many node IDs as possible. Sybil attacks attempt to centralize power in these decentralized networks: blockchain technology can be uniquely manipulated by this since processes are commonly automated, and DAOs are usually small teams of engineers and developers. </div>
<p>On peer-to-peer networks creating a multitude of identities could quickly consolidate power over the network. This is unlike an eclipse attack where a hacker will compromise just one by manipulating its actions. Sybil attacks instead use many nodes to manipulate information sent or received on the network. This can be incredibly effective when considering the unique inter-reliance and connectivity that decentralized systems have. </p>

<h2>What Is a Symbol?</h2>
<p>A symbol is the abbreviated name for a cryptoasset.</p>
<p>For example, Bitcoin’s symbol is BTC, while Ether’s is ETH. Then you have the likes of Binance Coin (known as BNB for short) and Dogecoin (DOGE).</p>
<p>Symbols are also used on the stock market for well-known public companies — turning Apple into AAPL, and Facebook into FB.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why symbols are actually necessary. In essence, they can help investors distinguish between digital assets that might have similar names.</p>
<p>Thanks to a seemingly endless number of hard forks, there are a number of cryptocurrencies that have Bitcoin in the title — Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV among them.</p>
<p>Symbols help traders distinguish between these coins — turning them into BTC, BCH and BSC. If assets are also being displayed on a fast-moving screen, these symbols also ensure that information can be understood quickly.</p>
<p>The number of letters in a symbol can vary — some only have one character, while others may have four or five.</p>

<preview>Synthetic assets, sometimes referred to as synths, are a combination of cryptocurrencies and traditional derivative assets. In other words, synths are tokenized derivatives.</preview>
<description>
<div>Decentralized finance on the blockchain is becoming increasingly popular. With this popularity, new forms of assets emerge, which cater to the needs of a wider group of users. Among these new assets are synthetic assets.</div>
<h2>What are synthetic assets?</h2>
<p>Synthetic assets are essentially tokenized derivatives. In the traditional financial world, derivatives are representations of stocks or bonds that a trader does not own but wants to buy or sell. In essence, if you want to profit from the price fluctuations of a stock that you don’t own, you can do this through a derivative. Synthetic assets, or tokenized derivatives, take this process one step further by adding the record for the derivative on the blockchain and essentially creating a cryptocurrency token for it. </p>
<div>In essence, synthetic assets create a blockchain record for the relationship between the underlying asset and the purchaser. Derivatives are becoming increasingly popular in the cryptocurrency world as they allow investors to bank on the fluctuations of various tokens without having to own any of these tokens in their wallets. In this sense, synthetic assets also gain traction with DeFi enthusiasts because they bring a tool available to traditional traders into the crypto world. </div>
<p>Synthetic assets essentially allow investors to tokenize and trade with anything. Using a derivative to tie the value to an already existing asset and then create a token for this derivative, investors can easily trade anything on the blockchain. One of the main reasons why synthetic assets are becoming a preferred method of investing is because of the added security and traceability. While traditionally trading happens on centralized exchanges, with synthetic assets, all trades happen on the blockchain. This guarantees traders both their anonymity, if they wish to remain unnamed, and their security, as all transactions are recorded in the distributed ledger. </p>
<div>With the rise of interest towards synthetic assets, more and more DeFi solutions enter the market. New synthetic asset exchanges are emerging on various blockchains to allow traders maximum flexibility and cheaper gas fees. Synthetix is probably the biggest and most popular synthetic asset exchange. As one of the first exchanges worldwide to be specifically created for trading tokenized derivatives, Synthetix is a leader in this niche market. Cream Finance and MakerDAO are two popular alternatives to Synthetix. </div>

<title>Tamper-Proof Ledger</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/tamper-proof-ledger</url>
<file>tamper-proof-ledger.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A tamper-proof ledger is essentially any system of records that has the fundamental properties of a blockchain distributed ledger.</preview>
<description>
<div>Blockchain technology relies heavily on security, which is why in theory, all blockchain ledgers are tamper-proof ledgers. The monetary system we currently operate with on a global scale consists of numerous ledgers. Banks and credit card companies are essentially ledgers at their very core - they store information about transactions, and the way money moves between parties. Unfortunately, the traditional banking system is often put under pressure because of the high risk of fraud and information tampering.</div>
<div>This is where blockchain technology or tamper-proof ledgers come into play. The first truly successful tamper-proof ledger came with the introduction of the Bitcoin whitepaper. Satoshi Nakamoto details a revolutionary idea of how to ensure the Bitcoin ledger will remain tamper-free. </div>
<div>While previous attempts at creating functional decentralized financial systems all focused on prohibiting tampering with the ledger, Nakamoto realized that it is sufficient just to incentivize users not to tamper with the ledger. This means that Bitcoin, specifically the Bitcoin blockchain, discourages tampering because this would mean automatic exclusion from the network. In essence, node operators responsible for validating transactions and thus adding new blocks to the chain are actively discouraged from tampering with the records because such a change will be easily detected. As a decentralized network, all Bitcoin node operators validate transactions based on the same copy of the ledger. If someone tries to tamper with the records, their copy will not match that of the remaining node operators; thus, consensus will not be achieved. If a node’s copy of the record does not match and there is no consensus, the node becomes inactive. </div>
<p>In essence, Bitcoin is the first natively tamper-proof ledger, as it discourages nodes from altering the records. If a node ceases to be in consensus with the rest of the network and becomes inactive, the node operator stops receiving mining rewards. In other words, Bitcoin node operators have no reason to tamper with the ledger, or they will stop receiving Bitcoin rewards.</p>
<div>Since Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many more blockchains have been created. Regardless of the consensus mechanism behind them, all of them rely on incentivizing note operators not to tamper with the records. This incentivization mechanism ensures that the distributed ledger remains tamper-proof regardless of how much it grows and how many blocks are added to it. </div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Taproot?</h2>
<div>Taproot is being touted as one of the most interesting upgrades to Bitcoin since the introduction of SegWit to the cryptocurrency’s blockchain. It will be an instantiation of a soft fork, intended to both improve privacy and improve other aspects tied to more complex transactions.</div>
<p>Its goal is to change the way in which the scripts operate within Bitcoin in order to improve the blockchain’s privacy, scalability and security. Taproot is designed to achieve by furnishing Bitcoin with a signature scheme known as Schnorr signatures. Schnorr Signatures were developed by Claus Schnorr and offer an advantage insofar as they can take multiple keys within a complex Bitcoin transaction and produce a single signature.</p>
<div>At present, transactions on Bitcoin can tap a range of complex features, such as timelock or multi-signature. Without Taproot, anyone can detect transactions that use these complex functions. Once the Bitcoin blockchain has been upgraded with the Taproof implementation, it will be possible to make all of these private. These complex transactions will simply appear like a single transaction, thereby increasing Bitcoin’s privacy.</div>
<p>Taproot even makes it possible to hide that a Bitcoin script has run altogether. Anyone monitoring the blockchain would see nothing but peer-to-peer transactions, even where more complex methods have in fact been used.</p>

<title>Technical Analysis/Trend Analysis (TA)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/technical-analysis-trend-analysis-ta</url>
<file>technical-analysis-trend-analysis-ta.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>An evaluation method involving statistical analyses of the market, such as price and volume. Charts and other tools are used to identify patterns to underpin and drive investment decisions.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Technical Analysis/Trend Analysis (TA)?</h2>
<p>Technical analysis is the study of market behavior using price charts to estimate future price direction. The concept that all elements that impact market price - fundamental knowledge, political events, natural catastrophes, and psychological considerations–are promptly discounted in market activity is the cornerstone of technical philosophy. To put it another way, the influence of these external events will immediately manifest itself in price movement, either upward or downward.</p>
<h2>Is Technical Analysis a Good Long-Term Investment Strategy?</h2>
<div>The answer to the question is no. Certainly not. Technical analysts are known for being quite active in their trades, maintaining positions for short periods of time in order to profit from market swings, both up and down. A technical analyst may go long or short on a coin depending on the data's prediction of price movement.</div>
<p>If a coin fails to perform as expected, an analyst makes a rapid decision to leave their position and use stop-loss orders to limit losses. While a value investor must be patient and wait for the market to correct its undervaluation of a coin, a technical analyst must have a high level of trading agility and be able to quickly enter and exit positions.</p>
<h2>Support and Resistance</h2>
<div>Support and resistance are two of the most fundamental ideas in technical analysis. These are the levels at which analysts predict a coin to begin climbing after a decrease (support) or decreasing after a gain (resistance). These critical levels are used to initiate trades because they suggest the direction in which a coin will bounce. If they believe a support level has been reached, they will go long, and if they believe a resistance level has been reached, they will go short.</div>
<h2>Basic Assumptions in Technical Analysis </h2>
<p>The following three assumptions underpin technical analysis theory:</p>
<div>Everything is discounted on the market: Analysts feel that the coin price already reflects the influence of all variables, from fundamentals to broader market psychology.</div>
<div>Price moves in trends: Technical analysts believe that prices will show patterns even in non-uniform market movements, regardless of the time frame in question.</div>
<div>History tends to repeat itself: Technical experts believe that history always repeats itself. This is due to the typically predictable market psychology, which has a consistent impact on pricing.</div>
<h2>Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis</h2>
<div>Both fundamental analysis and technical analysis are used to analyze and forecast future asset price patterns. They do, however, analyze asset prices using different data. Fundamental analysis attempts to determine an asset's inherent worth by evaluating its industry, business, and general environment. Only the asset's price and volume are considered in technical analysis. All of the known elements evaluated in fundamental analysis, according to technical experts, are included in the price, and there is no use in examining them further. In addition, technical analysts do not attempt to calculate long-term worth. They employ graphs to look for patterns and trends that indicate how an asset's price will move in the near future. </div>
<h2>Limitations of Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>Technical analysis critics claim that because history does not always repeat itself, the assumption made using technical analysis is inaccurate. Another objection is that technical analysis only works in certain situations and that this is because it contains a self-fulfilling prophecy. Furthermore, technical analysis is restricted to the study of market patterns and lacks the capacity to delve deeply into an instrument or sector to comprehend its inner workings.</p>
<p>When the market has started to move in a given direction, technical analysis is most useful and informative, rather than anticipating the movement, which requires fundamental background study.</p>

<title>Technical Indicators</title>

<file>technical-indicators.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A technical indicator is a statistical algorithm or pattern-based indication based on a security's or contract's historical price, volume, and/or open interest.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Technical Indicators?</h2>
<div>Technical indicators are tools that traders use to forecast future price changes - an important part of Technical Analysis (TA). </div>
<div>Technical analysis is a financial discipline that analyzes statistical trends obtained from market activity, such as price movement and volume, to analyze markets and discover new investment options. Unlike fundamental analysts, who seek to determine a security's inherent worth based on the financial data, technical analysts analyse a security's strength or weakness using price patterns, trading signals, and other quantitative charting tools.</div>
<div>Technical indicators, often known as &quot;technicals,&quot; rely on past trading data like price, volume, and open interest instead of business fundamentals like profits, sales, or profit margins. These are often employed by active traders since they are meant to assess short-term price fluctuations, but they may also be utilized by long-term investors to determine entry and exit locations. Some of the most popular technical indicators are On-Balance Volume (OBV), Accumulation/Distribution Line, Average Directional Index (ADV), Aroon Indicator, MACD, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Stochastic Oscillator. All these indicators take support of candlestick patterns to analyze the price movements and help traders forecast the next move. </div>
<div>Candlesticks are often considered to be the most well-known technical indication used by investors. The charts of candlesticks are used to show the OHLC values of an asset over a certain period. These values depict open, high, low, and closing prices, and the timeline is often divided into a month, week, day, hour, and minute. Green candlesticks often indicate a bullish movement (an increase in price), while red candlesticks indicate a bearish movement (a decrease in price).</div>
<div>Traders in the stock market and cryptocurrency world use candlestick signals to analyze the future price of an asset over a certain period (usually 1-hour cycles). Multiple trading strategies are incorporated with the help of candlesticks. The five most commonly known examples are three-line strike, two black gapping, three black crows, evening star, and the abandoned baby. All of these candlestick patterns are the subsets of two-day and three-day candlestick trading patterns. </div>
<div>The body of a single candlestick makes up the candlestick chart which displays the highs and lows of that day's trading performance. Bullish and bearish patterns are differentiated through candlestick patterns. Bullish patterns suggest that the price will likely climb, while bearish patterns suggest that the price will likely decrease. </div>
<p>When buyers outrun sellers on the bullish side of the market, an enveloping pattern forms. It gives room for prices to rise since bulls gain some grip on the financial market.</p>
<p>When sellers outweigh buyers in an upswing, a bearish engulfing pattern occurs. The pattern suggests that sellers have regained control of the market and that the price may continue to fall.</p>
<p>More data in addition to simply a price change over time can be revealed by candlesticks. They can be used to measure market mood and make forecasts about where the market may go next, data that is invaluable to experienced traders seeking patterns. </p>
<div>Market participants are drawn to candlestick patterns, however many of the reversion and continuation signals generated by these patterns do not operate dependably in today's technological world. However, many statistics reveal that a small subset of these patterns has remarkable accuracy, providing traders with meaningful buy and sell recommendations. </div>

<title>Terahashes Per Second</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/terahashes-per-second</url>
<file>terahashes-per-second.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Terahashes per second (Th/s) is equivalent to 1 trillion (1,000,000,000,000) hashes per second, a unit that indicates the power of a computer or mining machine.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Terahashes Per Second?</h2>
<div>Terahashes per second is a measurement of the rate of data processing power. A hash is a unit of measurement for the amount of computer processing power required to solve a problem. The more hashes you get per second, the more processing power you have.</div>
<div>Terahashes per second is one unit that shows how much computing power you have. Hash rate is measured in units, such as megahashes, gigahashes, terahashes per second, and so on.</div>
<div>One terahash is 1 trillion (1,000,000,000) hashes per second. In the context of Bitcoin mining or blockchain, the rate of hashes per second is important because it determines how long it takes to complete a block.</div>
<h2>Hash Rate in Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency mining uses computers to solve complex math problems to verify transactions on a public ledger called the blockchain. This process, known as mining, secures, stores, and tracks cryptocurrency. The more computing power a miner has, the more likely they are to win the race of verifying transactions and earning digital currency. </p>
<p>The hash rate of a cryptocurrency is the measure of a miner's processing power. This number indicates how long it takes for a single miner to process all the transactions in a block.</p>
<p>If the number is lower, transactions will be processed faster because there will be fewer miners competing for the same block reward. However, if you have a low hash rate, then it will take longer to receive your first payment.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, when Bitcoin was just emerging as a currency, ordinary desktop computers were able to mine blocks with ease. As more people started mining, the difficulty of finding new blocks increased significantly to the point where the average time for solving a single block began exceeding 10 minutes. </p>
<p>The Bitcoin network adjusts difficulty so that one block is found every 10 minutes on average. That means there are lots of blocks that need fewer than one solution, so lots of your work is wasted (because finding those solutions only earns you transaction fees). The higher your hash rate, the more often you'll be able to successfully mine Bitcoins.</p>
<p>The effect of this is clear: a miner with a 3 GH/s hashing speed will find approximately three times as many Bitcoins per month as a miner with a 1 GH/s mining speed.</p>
<p>Hash rate is the single most important factor when determining profitability. Mining hardware efficiency increases every day while Bitcoin exchange rates continue to rise. This is an important factor in determining how much energy it costs to mine Bitcoin. More hashes mean more electricity is needed to solve the mathematical problem so it's all relative.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, the lower your electricity costs (or the better your mining rig) the more profitable mining will be for you.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Testnet?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, a testnet is a separate blockchain where developers can put new features through their paces without worrying about jeopardizing the main network.</p>
<p>Adding new products or tools to a live blockchain can be fraught with risk, and there can be huge consequences unless they are aggressively tested under a plethora of scenarios first. In the worst-case scenario, vulnerabilities may emerge that hackers can exploit — resulting in people losing money.</p>
<p>While a testnet is in use, developers will be keeping a close eye for errors. They may also invite some users to try out the blockchain in order to get constructive feedback.</p>
<p>Once a feature has been trialled on a testnet, it may go on to be introduced on the mainnet. However, in the case of decentralized networks, members of the ecosystem may need to be given the opportunity to vote first.</p>
<p>Testnets can also provide a valuable simulation tool that enables people to experiment with cryptocurrencies and try new things without having to worry about any consequences.</p>

<preview>Developed by Richard Cantillon, The Cantillon Effect is a change in relative prices resulting from a change in the money supply.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Cantillon Effect?</h2>
<div>Developed by Richard Cantillon, The Cantillon Effect is a change in relative prices resulting from a change in the money supply. It describes the velocity of money through the economy, and the uneven effect its diffusion has on prices, wages and inflation. While the effect discusses the changes in money supply, it specifically refers to the effect of unequal access to that increased money supply. </div>
<p>The Cantillon Effect is most visible in the contemporary US economy. Stimulus packages aimed at creating economic activity by increasing the money supply (Quantitative Easing) gave businesses large sums of new money, especially during the pandemic. The result was that businesses that put their affairs in order were able to repay existing debt, bought stock, and generally did what Richard Cantillon forecasted they would do with their money. </p>
<p>As they did so, they drove up prices, and not just on the stock market. What’s worse is, they took money right back out of the economy again by using it to pay down debts and buy up capital goods. The public at large will see the inflation, but not most of the money.</p>
<div>Applying the Cantillon Effect on digital assets, its example could be observed when the price of BTC passed $60,000 for the first time back in March 2020 after the stimulus package was passed by the House. This was partially fuelled by a perception of BTC as “digital gold”, an inflation-proof asset that can’t be quantitatively eased or fractionally banked. It’s also an even greater influx of HNWI and institutional investors, seeking an inflation hedge, a safe haven, and a base for their financial and economic activities more certain than the shifting sands of the US dollar. </div>
<div>Bio: Gunnar Jaerv is the chief operating officer of First Digital Trust — Hong Kong’s technology-driven financial institution powering the digital asset industry and servicing financial technology innovators. Prior to joining First Digital Trust, Gunnar founded several tech startups, including Hong Kong-based Peak Digital and Elements Global Enterprises in Singapore.</div>

<preview>The DAO is the first decentralized autonomous organization, which was created by a group of developers in April 2016.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the DAO?</h2>
<div>The DAO is the first-ever decentralized autonomous organization. It launched in April 2016 after an initial token crowdsale worth USD 150 million. A group of developers created the DAO to serve as a decentralized venture capital fund, which could self-govern. The main idea for the creators of the DAO was to eliminate the human error factor in fund management on a high level.</div>
<div>The DAO focused on capitalizing Ether, and at some point, held about fourteen percent of the total supply of the cryptocurrency. The DAO did not have the traditional management structure you expect to see in a venture capital fund as it was a completely decentralized organization. The organization was based on a completely open-source code, which meant that anyone could contribute to the way it functioned. In addition, as a decentralized organization, the DAO was not affiliated with any particular nation or state. This posed significant regulatory hurdles and queries and led to numerous precedents.</div>
<div>One of the main ideas behind the DAO was to be a self-governing organization where anyone could participate, regardless of their location. Thanks to the innate decentralization powers of blockchain technology, the DAO became the first fully decentralized venture capital fund.</div>
<p>Unfortunately, in June 2016, only a couple of months after the DAO was launched, vulnerabilities in the code were published in an anonymous paper. The paper warned investors to hold off on voting on any other investment decisions before the developer team addressed these vulnerabilities. At this point, the DAO held about 14% of all ETH available on the market. After the paper was published, hackers got hold of it and started exploiting the vulnerabilities described in the document. This led to one of the greatest hacks in the history of cryptocurrencies and decentralized organizations. </p>
<div>The hackers managed to take off with more than 3.6 million ETH, which at the time was worth around USD 50 million. Because of the huge amount of stolen funds, investors in the DAO started arguing, and some started calling for the complete shutdown of the project. Additionally, Ethereum was forced to go through a hard fork. </div>
<p>Following the hack, several of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges decided to delist the DAO token. This decision effectively led to the crash and imminent death of the DAO as an organization. While the DAO as an organization is now in history, DAOs are gaining more popularity by the minute. The technology and organization behind them have improved significantly, mainly thanks to the lessons developers learned from the DAO hack scandal.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the Merge (Ethereum 2.0)?</h2>
<div>The Ethereum network is undergoing a series of massive upgrades, introducing dozens of changes to the network, including a consensus mechanism: Proof-of-Stake.</div>
<div>Ethereum 2.0 is far too big and complex to be introduced in a single release. Instead, it will be implemented over several stages, the first of which is called the Beacon Chain.</div>
<div>The merge will replace the proof-of-work consensus mechanism with a proof-of-stake system while benefiting from the full history and the current state of Ethereum to enable a smooth transition. </div>
<h2>What Is the Beacon Chain?</h2>
<p>The Beacon Chain is a new blockchain that is running alongside Ethereum to help with the transition from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The Beacon Chain, which is considered phase 0 of a major upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain, went live on December 1, 2020.</p>
<div>After the merge, the next stage will be the deployment of 64 shard chains to boost the network’s capacity and transaction speeds. Sharding is becoming an increasingly common way of splitting up the massive volumes of data handled on a blockchain into smaller pieces to decrease network congestion and boost processing speeds.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Throughput?</h2>
<p>Throughput is a measure of how many actions are completed within a given time frame. In the blockchain space, transaction throughput refers to a rate of how fast a blockchain processes transactions, which is commonly expressed in transactions per second (TPS), but may also be expressed in minutes (TPM) or hours (TPH).</p>
<div>The consensus mechanism employed by a blockchain platform determines a decentralized protocol’s transaction throughput. For example, a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain like Bitcoin has a lower throughput compared to a proof-of-stake (PoS) network like Cardano. Other factors that affect throughput include a blockchain's block size, traffic and complexity of transactions.</div>
<p>Note that traffic is the network’s load at a given time. As such, a high load means less speed and vice versa.</p>
<div>There are times when slower blockchains like Bitcoin may execute transactions quicker than, say Ethereum, due to the complexity of transactions. While Bitcoin transactions are exclusive to asset transfers, Ethereum can be used to process complex transactions like minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs), trading on DEXs, etc., which require more computing power, hence, more load on the network.</div>
<div>To increase a blockchain’s throughput, developers use various methods such as rollups, sidechains, state channels, new consensus mechanisms, and block size increases.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>The ticker symbol is the unique combination of letters assigned to stocks or cryptocurrencies that makes them distinguishable on exchanges and other trading applications.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is a ticker symbol?</h2>
<div>In essence, a ticker symbol is the short combination of letters that is used to represent an asset, stock, or cryptocurrency token on various exchanges, swapping services, and other DeFi solutions. </div>
<div>For example, Bitcoin’s ticker symbol is BTC, while Ethereum’s ticker symbol is ETH. Ticker symbols are extremely important in the worlds of stocks and cryptocurrency alike. These are the identifying markers that allow traders to know what asset they are looking at. </div>
<div>Every stock and every cryptocurrency token has to have a unique ticker symbol. Usually, this symbol consists of a three-letter combination. However, with the rise in different altcoins, today, there are ticker symbols that consist of four or even five letters. Examples of such include Tether (USDT), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Polygon (MATIC).</div>
<p>In the constantly developing world of cryptocurrencies, ticker symbols play a vital role for traders. As new tokens launch by the minute, some of them may have very similar names. This is where ticker symbols make a difference. For example, someone new to the cryptocurrency world who wants to purchase Bitcoin can only be sure that they are buying the right token if they look at the ticker. You could confuse Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash; however, the latter’s ticker symbol is BCH, while Bitcoin’s ticker symbol is BTC.</p>
<p>In this sense, ticker symbols play a vital role for traders and investors who are trying to navigate the vast cryptocurrency universe. Without them, trading would be significantly more confusing.</p>
<div>Another important function ticker symbols play is to prevent fraud and scams. While two cryptocurrencies can have the same, or at least very similar names, they can never have the same ticker symbol. Scam tokens aim to replicate the name and token symbol as much as possible in order to fool investors into buying them. However, naming rules do not allow two stocks or two cryptocurrency tokens to have the same ticker. This means that one surefire way to avoid purchasing a scam token is to research and know the ticker symbol of the token you’re actually looking to acquire. </div>
<p>Ticker symbols were initially introduced on stock exchanges in the United States towards the end of the 19th century. As more stocks were introduced on the market, floor traders realized that they need a quick and easy way to communicate with each other regarding different companies. This is why ticker symbols were first invented. </p>

<div>TWAMM refers to Time-Weighted Automated Market Maker. Its aim is to help traders execute large orders with minimal slippage and low gas fees without negatively affecting the price.
In traditional finance (TradFi), traders will often employ brokers to execute large orders algorithmically over a designated time frame, which often gets them the best price. This is often done in the most straightforward way via a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) order, which gives a security or asset’s price over the designated time frame. </div>
<div>For example, when large traders want to buy an asset, like $10 million worth of Solana, they cannot just execute that as one trade as it will increase the market price by a large number. Typically they will use a trading desk or an algorithm to break down the $10 million order into smaller orders of $1,000 across many hours or days to have less impact on price in the market.
The TWAMM strives to emulate TWAP orders by breaking them up into a combination of an almost infinite number of small orders via an automated market maker (AMM) over a period of time.</div>
<div>This method of trading may result in prices deviating from the crypto market as a whole. The TWAMM relies on arbitrageurs to mitigate this issue, by trading against the AMM’s price to return it back to the market price, ensuring effective execution for long-term orders.</div>
<p>When traders place large buy orders on AMMS, they face the same problems encountered in TradFi due to the constant product formula utilized by the AMM, and buying all at once pushes market makers to raise the price against the trader. Breaking up the trades manually as an alternative can be time-consuming and costs extra gas fees due to the additional transactions required. The TWAMM aims to resolve this issue by automating the small trades, maximizing the smoothness of executing trades at minimal gas fees.</p>
<div>The TWAMM algorithm is one of the first in DeFi which allows users to enter parameters on how much to buy and sell of an asset over a time period like 1 week, number of hours, or days without going to a CEX or some trading desk.</div>
<div>As DeFi and crypto become more mainstream and larger investors enter the market, features like the TWAMM will become essential in facilitating a better trading experience for all users, further facilitating the adoption and usage of DEXs.</div>

<h2>What Is the Time-weighted Average Price (TWAP)?</h2>
<p>The time-weighted average price (TWAP) is a trading indicator based on weighted average price, which shows the average price of an asset as it rises and falls during a given or specific time period.</p>
<p>In traditional finance, stock brokers often help traders and clients to execute large orders algorithmically over a set period of time to get the best price and reduce market impact. This happens through a TWAP order, which gives an asset’s price over a set period of time. </p>
<p>The brokers must first identify the opening, closing, high and low prices for the asset on a given day and then find the average of those daily prices for each day when tracking the asset to calculate the TWAP. Using the TWAP value, a large order into a few small orders is valued at the TWAP price because it is deemed the most critical.</p>
<p>Once each order is executed, there will be a delay for (duration/order count) minutes. For example, if the duration is 30 minutes, and the order count is 6, then there will be a (30 / 6) = 5-minute delay between each order. Generally, traders do this to avoid letting a huge order suddenly increase the value of a given asset in the market.</p>
<div>TWAP can be calculated for any specified time duration and does not take into consideration the number of shares traded at each price point measured, unlike the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) indicator.  </div>
<div>However, in Decentralized Finance (DeFI), a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) using a time-weighted average market maker (TWAMM) aims to help traders execute large orders as efficiently and as quickly as possible, at low gas prices and without negatively affecting price. </div>
<p>This makes things much simpler while allowing traders and users to set relevant parameters without having to pay intermediary fees, unlike in traditional finance.</p>

<title>Timelock/Locktime</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/timelock-locktime</url>
<file>timelock-locktime.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A condition for a transaction to only be processed at a certain time or block on the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Timelock/Locktime?</h2>
<p>Timelock can be considered as a schedule by which cryptocurrency transactions are processed by miners on the blockchain. </p>
<div>Based on the block height approved by miners, transactions will be included in the Merkle Tree. </div>
<p>Transactions are only approved once this is done. </p>
<div>Timelocks were initially added by the cryptocurrency Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. </div>
<p>The purpose was for this to be present in all transactions. </p>
<p>The default blocking time is 0x00000000 (0). </p>
<p>Timelocks ensure transactions are not verified unless a certain time or block height is reached. </p>
<p>Timelocks can be absolute or time relative. </p>
<p>Absolute timelocks ensure blocks are defined relative to a certain time. </p>
<p>Time-relative timelocks are in place to determine how much time must elapse before transactions can be verified. </p>
<p>Time can be measured in two following ways in Bitcoin transactions. These are according to the transaction’s block number and its timestamp. </p>
<div>Miners will receive a specific block number once a timelock is determined based on a block number. </div>
<p>For timelocks which are based on timestamps, miners must wait until the specific time period has elapsed before confirming the transaction. </p>
<p>Unix time is used to measure this. </p>
<div>There are four ways to determine timeblocks for Bitcoin. Half of these are the transaction level meanwhile the other half are on script level. </div>
<p>These are: nSequence, nLocktime, CheckLockTimeVerify, CheckSquenceVerify. </p>
<p>nLockTime involves absolute blocking at transaction level. </p>
<p>nSequence is a timelock relative to transaction levels. </p>
<p>CheckLockTimeVerify involves absolute time blocking at script level. </p>
<p>CheckSquenceVerify is a time lock relative to script level. </p>

<preview>A form of identification for when a certain transaction occurred.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Timestamp?</h2>
<div>Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of Bitcoin, wrote in his whitepaper that timestamps aim to eradicate the threat of double counting. </div>
<p>Timestamps are an integral process in miners receiving compensation for mining each block. </p>
<p>This is because without the timestamp it would be difficult for new nodes to prove the difficulty, or lack of difficulty, or how long it took to mine a block. </p>
<div>To ensure difficulty is calculated accurately, blockchain stamps are used as opposed to real time. </div>
<div>When a BTC block is generated, two timestamps are usually involved. </div>
<div>One is the block header which is imputed by the miner. </div>
<p>The second is the actual at which the block was created. </p>
<p>While theoretically both should yield the same timestamp, there is always the slight risk of miners inputting incorrect times or lying about times. </p>
<p>Bitcoin has two ways of preventing this risk from happening. </p>
<p>The first is called the Median Time Stamp. The MPT rule stipulates the time stamp must be higher than the median value of the past 11 blocks. </p>
<p>The maximum allowable time difference between the time given by the node and local time system cannot exceed 90 minutes. </p>
<p>The purpose of the first rule is to ensure the blockchain moves forward in time while the second rule is aimed at preventing blockchain forward too much. </p>
<p>Both rules are aimed at protecting the integrity of cryptocurrency timestamps. </p>

<file>tipset.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>A tipset is a set, rather than a chain, of blocks that make up a blockchain. </preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Tipset?</h2>
<p>A tipset is a term mostly used to describe the blockchain of decentralized storage system Filecoin. Filecoin’s consensus mechanism is built on tipsets, as their Expected Consensus system (unlike Bitcoin) is election-based and allows for multiple miners to be the elected leaders in a round.</p>
<p>This means that Filecoin (or another similar storage system) allows more than one storage miner to create blocks in one epoch, which in turn increases the network throughput. Basing a blockchain on tipsets can also contribute to the security of the network: simply put, since each tipset’s weight is relative to the amount of storage it provides, any node that attempts to disrupt the creation of valid blocks must contend against the consensus’ preference for heavier chains.</p>
<div>Filecoin’s tipset system is similar to Ethereum, since the system motivates participants to collaborate and prevents work being wasted through an increase in chain throughput. </div>
<p>The advantages of using a tipset system are that miners will gather together to support the heaviest chain, or the chain that is creating value — this is because decentralized storage systems naturally prioritize chains that are offering more storage. Tipsets that are lighter chains become orphan blocks, since they don’t have the draw of greater storage power.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Token?</h2>
<div>Tokens must not be mistaken with cryptocurrencies or altcoins. </div>
<p>Tokens and altcoins are subsets of cryptocurrencies. </p>
<div>Tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that are used as a specific asset or represent a particular use on the blockchain. </div>
<div>They are sometimes created through initial coin offerings (ICOs) — or other fundraising methods including initial DEX offerings (IDOs). </div>
<p>Tokens can have multiple purposes. The two most common types are security and utility tokens. </p>
<p>Security tokens operate in a similar way to shares. This is since their value is determined by a tradable external asset. </p>
<p>Utility tokens enable users access to products or services provided by a platform.</p>
<p>One stark difference between security and utility tokens is the degree of regulation between both. </p>
<p>Utility tokens may not be subject to the same degree of regulations that security tokens can be. </p>
<p>Failure for a firm to abide by rules can often lead to harsh penalties for a firm that has issued security tokens.</p>
<p>A blockchain startup can issue tokens to give its buyers certain privileges and access to certain products and services in the future. </p>
<p>While not all ICOs have been successful, some optimists argue ICOs could replace traditional initial public offerings.</p>
<p>Such a move could see cryptocurrency tokens swell further in popularity. </p>

<h2>What Is a Token Economy?</h2>
<div>Token economies refer to the economics of goods and services that have been tokenized. Blockchain technology enables these economies to function without the need for intermediaries and third parties. Blockchain and token economies offer a solution to bridge the physical and digital gap between our increasingly global and virtual worlds. </div>
<p>In a token economy, blockchain technology is used to take physical assets, digitize them, prove their ownership, and potentially trade them. The same principles apply to tokenizing an asset that is already in digital form. </p>
<p>The four tools you need to work with tokens, sometimes called digital assets, are Documentation, Tokenization, Governance, and Trading.</p>
<p>Token economies are essentially a digital analogy to the interaction of parties and entities in the real world, based on quantifiable units (tokens), governed by mathematics, and secured by cryptography.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Token Generation Event?</h2>
<p>To understand what a Token Generation Event is, one needs to understand the basics of tokens and tokenization. </p>
<p>A token is a digital unit designed with utility in mind, providing access and use of a larger crypto economic system. It does not have a store of value on its own but is made so that software can be developed around it.</p>
<div>Tokens are usually created through an initial coin offering. </div>
<p>ICOs are a type of crowdfunding, using cryptocurrencies as a means of raising capital for early-stage companies. </p>
<p>But not all companies looking to raise capital from tokens necessarily go down the ICO route. </p>
<p>Some firms can opt for a Token Generation Event instead. </p>
<p>Both ICOs and Token Generation Events serve a similar purpose, but fear of regulatory consequences means that some companies prefer to brand their fundraising campaigns as Token Generation Events. </p>
<p>Most Token Generation Events involve companies raising tokens in the utilities industry. </p>
<p>As these types of tokens normally constitute a small proportion of the product, companies prefer to call their token sales Token Generation Events. </p>
<p>Regulatory bodies have come under increased pressure to treat ICOs as a security and therefore fact the specter of taxation. </p>
<p>In contrast, Token Generation Events are not treated as securities, and are not taxable. </p>
<div>Hence, issuers of tokens may see tax advantages in calling their events Token Generation Events as opposed to initial coin offerings.</div>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Token issuance is the process of creating new tokens and adding them to the total token supply of a cryptocurrency.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is token issuance?</h2>
<div>Token issuance is one of the most important processes in the world of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Essentially, token issuance is the process of creating new tokens that are then added to the total supply of the cryptocurrency. </div>
<div>Depending on the blockchain and cryptocurrency, token issuance may take different forms. Usually, token issuance is regulated by complex algorithmic calculations that determine the amount of tokens necessary for the blockchain ecosystem to function properly. The total supply of tokens for each cryptocurrency is different. The amount of tokens comprising the total supply is also calculated through complex algorithmic functions. </div>
<div>It is important that blockchain-based projects and cryptocurrencies, in general, detail how the process of token issuance works for their specific system. As there are numerous consensus mechanisms out there, different crypto blockchains have various setups when it comes to token issuance. </div>
<div>For example, the Bitcoin whitepaper details that there can only ever be 21 million Bitcoin tokens. Consequently, Bitcoin issuance will cease once this threshold of 21 million tokens is reached. Other cryptocurrencies have opted not to have a maximum supply limit. Regardless of the style and type of cryptocurrency, token issuance is one of the most important processes, and it has to be described in detail. </div>
<p>Going back to consensus mechanisms, some cryptocurrencies also utilize a process called token burning. This is the complete opposite of token issuance, as tokens are effectively destroyed forever. Some consensus mechanisms rely on a combination of token issuance and token burning to ensure there is agreement across the network of nodes. </p>
<p>Token issuance may also refer to the process of tokenization, in which an asset outside of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is added to the blockchain via a specific crypto token. In such cases, token issuance becomes the process of creating a token, yet not one that belongs to a cryptocurrency, but rather a token that represents an outside asset.</p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrency, token issuance is very important. The rules governing token issuance on different projects help investors determine whether they want to invest in the project or not. Additionally, these rules can also have an impact on the valuation of cryptocurrencies. More often than not, cryptocurrencies that have a fixed maximum supply experience price hikes when the blockchain is close to reaching this maximum supply limit. </p>

<title>Token Lockup</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-lockup</url>
<file>token-lockup.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Token lockup refers to a time period during which cryptocurrency tokens cannot be exchanged or traded.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Token Lockup?</h2>
<div>Token lock-up (or vesting period) is a time span, generally following a token sale, during which token holders of a cryptocurrency project are not permitted to sell their tokens. The lock-up period assists initiatives in avoiding liquidity issues while new projects are still building their supporting base.</div>
<div>For example, the FLOW token generated 1.25 billion FLOW during its token production and distribution stage. The tokens were locked up for about a year, meanwhile, the tokens retained their value and the network remained functional. With the token generation, the lock-up period and transfer limitations were set, ensuring that pre-launch investors, team members, and community members are all on an equal footing.</div>
<div>With the help of lock-up periods, the project earns more money because of both the demand and the value of the token rise. However, the main reason for instituting a lock-up period is that it protects the market from being bombarded with excessive tokens which in turn lowers the value of the token due to increased sales.</div>
<div>The DeFi sector is now facing two major challenges: protecting investors from fraudulent projects and allowing project creators to lock their tokens and secure the confidence of their community. With a rising number of rug pulls and crypto scams in the DeFi market, investors are asking developers to lock their liquidity and limit the risk of founder fraud. </div>
<div>Developers arrange smart contracts and deposit a particular quantity of tokens in a cold wallet, locking it for a specified length of time, say eight months. The creators construct a public profile of the token lock-up for their community. This instills confidence in the project and the team since it keeps them motivated to focus on long-term development rather than the market price of their coin. Additionally, it also boosts the confidence of the public supporting the project.</div>
<div>To ensure a healthy network and ecosystem, project developers must tightly maintain token lockup requirements for the team and advisors, private sale participants, and public sale (IEO) participants. One of the price stability techniques is the locking up of tokens. Tokens that have been locked up are not part of the circulating supply. These are designed to terminate withdrawals after a cryptocurrency's debut, so no team members or investors will be able to acquire their tokens until the lockup period expires. This encourages the crew to concentrate on the product rather than selling their stakes immediately after launch.</div>
<div>Large sell-offs are typical following initial coin offerings (ICO), in which initial investors or the project's founders sell their holdings immediately after the cryptocurrency reaches the market, resulting in massive price decreases. To prevent this from occurring, token lockups are implemented, and they provide further trust to potential token sale participants.</div>
<div>Because the locked-up tokens are not part of the circulating supply, they are not taken into account in a technical analysis done by investors and traders.</div>

<title>Token Migration</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/token-migration</url>
<file>token-migration.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Token migration refers to the process of moving tokens from one blockchain to another as a result of a change in the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Token Migration?</h2>
<div>Token migration (also known as token swaps) occurs when a token is transferred from one blockchain to another during a blockchain changeover. It is crucial to remember that token migrations aren't always associated with new blockchain launches; they may also occur when projects simply switch from one protocol to another.</div>
<div>As an example, Mithril (MiTH) was migrated from Ethereum to Binance Chain. Because many new projects lack their own blockchain or it is still at the development stage, they opt to migrate their investors’ tokens from the third-party platforms to their own chains, which is when token migrations occur.</div>
<div>Many early crypto projects and companies used Ethereum's ERC20 token in 2018, however, after their own blockchain was ready, tokens were migrated to their native blockchains. One advantage of this method is that investors are not required to lock up these funds. Rather, they may trade these placeholder tokens on exchanges while new projects are developing their technology.</div>
<p>Token transfers from one third-party blockchain to another are also possible for technical or economical factors. </p>
<div>Often, blockchain efforts begin with the release of whitepapers that promise breakthrough technologies in the future. The road from designing paper to finished product typically takes many twists and turns, and some projects substantially change their concepts, such as moving to a different blockchain. </div>
<div>Investors may be obliged to migrate to a cryptocurrency or token in certain situations. This necessitates shifting the balance of a token holder from one blockchain to another.</div>
<div>Token migration involves balance transfers of investors from their Ethereum wallets to a new compatible wallet of a certain project. Therefore, tokens actually move from one blockchain to another after the transition has taken place.</div>
<div>An initial coin offering (ICO) is a form of fundraising strategy in which a project creates a token that can be purchased by anyone who wants to participate in the business's future advancements, which are generally detailed in a whitepaper.</div>
<div>The ICO boom took place in 2018 on the Ethereum network, utilizing ERC-20 tokens. Some of these projects suggested that the tokens purchased by investors will be used in future technologies, such as the blockchains they planned to build.</div>
<div>After completing their own blockchains, the projects transferred their investors' tokens from Ethereum to their own chains. This is similar to the difference between renting a car and buying the same automobile for long-term use.</div>
<div>The technique for moving tokens differs depending on the project. You may be needed to begin the migration on your own if you keep your tokens. This, however, does not imply that you must be familiar with the intricacies of programming. Most projects offer methods that link to your wallet address and enable you to move tokens in a matter of seconds.</div>
<p>If your tokens are held on a major and well-known cryptocurrency exchange, they'll probably manage the token transfer for you.</p>
<div>With the ongoing drive for blockchain integration and adaptability, the practice of token migrations — especially the ones that may operate on various chains — is likely to flourish and acquire popularity within the emerging blockchain ecosystem.</div>

<title>Token Sale</title>

<file>token-sale.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A token sale refers to the initial offering of a cryptocurrency token to a private pool of investors before it officially goes on the market.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What is a token sale?</h2>
<div>A token sale is the initial stage of token offering before the cryptocurrency becomes publicly available for everyone to trade in. There are several types of token sales; however, probably the most popular of them is an initial coin offering (ICO). An initial coin offering allows early adopters and investors to purchase a new cryptocurrency token before going live on international exchanges. ICOs usually require the investors to perform specific actions, like lock up a portion of the tokens they receive. </div>
<p>Token sales are a very important mechanic in the early stages of all new cryptocurrencies. As the abundance of tokens on the market grows, token sales allow developers to introduce investors to their projects early on. Not only that, token sales are the most popular way for new projects to secure the funding they need to keep on developing their product. </p>
<p>As more and more altcoins make it to the market, token sales also serve as a tool for investors to weed out what cryptocurrencies they want to invest in. Throughout the duration of a token sale, developers spend a lot of time on marketing and educational sessions in order to introduce their product to a select pool of investors. Some cryptocurrency projects have also tried to use their token sales as a marketing tool by only inviting certain people to participate in the initial stages of investment. </p>
<div>Token sales are always detailed in the whitepapers of new projects, as they play an important role in the further valuation of the tokens. Information about the number of tokens dedicated to initial token sales can also provide insight into how much the project is willing to sell privately in order to raise enough funds to continue forward. </div>
<p>As token sales happen at the very early stages of development for cryptocurrency projects, they are a great way to judge whether a project will be successful or not. Because of that, in the early years of cryptocurrencies, especially in 2017 and 2018, there was a boom in token sales on the market. Investors became overwhelmed with the number of new tokens thrown at them, leading to a crisis on the market. </p>
<p>Nowadays, however, token sales serve as a good way to get a feel for a new token and possibly get the chance to become an early adopter and reap better rewards. </p>

<file>token-standard.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The most common token standard today is the Ethereum Request for Comment or ERC.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Token Standard?</h2>
<p>In order to fully understand what a token standard actually is, you'll need to get some background knowledge on what exactly a smart contract standard is. A smart contract standard essentially describes the rules that the smart contract has to comply with in order to actually utilize the underlying blockchain network, and the standards are application-level to blockchains that are built for smart contracts as well as other decentralized applications or DApps. The smart contract standard can include token standards, name registries as well as a library or package formats, and a lot more.</p>
<p>By defining the standard, a smart contract has to obey the requirements in order to actually enable basic functions such as the creation of tokens or the performing of transactions.</p>
<p>Smart contract standards play an important role in the network due to the fact that they essentially define the rules of utilizing the blockchain network — a good standard can make the communication among different smart contracts within the same blockchain network efficient. The boom of smart contracts, as well as their interoperability, can also help the development of the entirety of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now, the token standard is the subsidiary of the smart contract standard. For the blockchain that supports the smart contracts, the token standard is often included to tell people how to create, issue as well as deploy new tokens which are based on their underlying blockchain.</p>
<p>Currently, the most commonly used blockchain when it comes to building smart contracts is Ethereum and it has developed different kinds of standards for supporting various smart contracts. </p>
<p>The most common token standard today is the Ethereum Request for Comment or ERC, and this can be ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-777 and ERC 1155, to name a few.</p>

<file>token-swap.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Token swaps can refer to one of two things: 1. Direct exchange of a certain amount of one cryptocurrency token for another between users facilitated by a special exchange service. 2. Migratio</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Token Swap?</h2>
<p>1. There are many exchange services on the market that allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies for traditional currencies or for other cryptos. However, due to the limited liquidity and number of trading pairs on each exchange, users that want to trade directly between two crypto tokens are sometimes unable to do so.</p>
<div>This is especially true for the less popular tokens, because they are often only available on a small number of exchanges. Instead of a direct trade, users are forced to include the intermediate step of converting into and out of fiat money or one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, such as BTC or ETH. </div>
<p>However, some exchange services target this issue specifically by aggregating multiple other exchanges and sourcing liquidity from them. The end result is that users are able to swap between two cryptocurrencies directly without the inconvenience and double fees associated with conducting a trade in two steps. Some of the services that allow token swaps are Metamask, ShapeShift and AirSwap.</p>
<div>2. In addition to serving their direct purpose — as decentralized digital money — some cryptocurrencies like ETH, NEO and QTUM allow users to launch other crypto tokens on top of their blockchains.</div>
<p>These second-layer tokens can “piggyback” off the underlying platforms and enjoy some of their security and popularity without having to spend time and resources on growing their own ecosystem from the ground up. </p>
<p>However, in some cases, the platform a token is built upon may become inadequate for its current needs. For example, developers might build their token on Ethereum’s blockchain to leverage its large user base during the initial coin offering, but then decide that they need different underlying parameters for the actual product launch.</p>
<p>In such cases, a token swap is possible, wherein the developers migrate their token from one blockchain base to another, while maintaining all address balances.</p>

<h2>What Does it Mean to Tokenize?</h2>
<p>Tokenization is a buzz word that is commonly thrown around the blockchain and cryptocurrency world. However, despite the fact that this word is commonly used, many people do not know what it actually means. In this article, we will break down everything that you need to know about tokenization so that you can be fully informed about the topic.</p>
<div>Tokenization is the process of turning various items into digital assets called tokens. Tokens typically operate on blockchains and are controlled through smart contracts and algorithms. Many different types of assets can be tokenized. For example, real estate, works of art, percentages of ownership in a company, etc. can all be tokenized. </div>
<p>Tokenization is becoming more and more popular because it reduces friction for companies wanting to obtain funding by selling assets on an open market. For example, companies who do not want to deal with the IPO process can potentially issue a token instead of a stock offering. Blockchain tokens are commonly traded on cryptocurrency exchanges and are subject to price swings based on supply and demand.</p>
<div>Both security tokens and utility tokens have proven to be extremely useful and desirable. They are different from traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin, but they both still use blockchain technology and are both tradable financial units. As the entire blockchain space is still in its initial stages, the regulatory framework for both utility tokens and security tokens is still being figured out around the world. </div>
<p>However, it is extremely likely that more and more companies will create both utility tokens and security tokens in the near future. </p>
<p>Tokenization provides companies many benefits. It gives them a way to help their users use their products and to reduce dependence on third parties for securing public funding. For this reason, both the security token market and the utility token market will most likely continue to grow substantially in the coming years as more and more companies figure out how to use them to their advantage. </p>

<h2>What Are Tokenized Carbon Credits?</h2>
<p>Tokenized carbon credits represent carbon that has been avoided or removed from the environment. One metric tonne of carbon verifiably avoided or removed translates to one carbon credit. They are created upon bridging carbon credits from voluntary carbon market registries onto the blockchain. </p>
<p>Carbon credits are often integrated into sustainability strategies as a tool for organizations to compensate for net greenhouse gas emissions. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and carbon industry bodies develop independent criteria to verify these carbon credits and ensure their integrity.</p>
<div>Tokenized carbon credits can be utilized as a financial tool within cryptocurrency ecosystems, empowering individuals, corporations, and governments to access carbon as an investable asset. Tokenization also helps to improve liquidity within carbon markets – a space that has been driven by OTC transactions. Thus, using a blockchain ledger addresses a range of issues inherent to the traditional carbon markets: improved liquidity, access, transparency, pricing signals, and data standardization.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Are Tokenized Securities?</h2>
<p>Tokenized securities are when the ownership of a security is materialized through the issuance of a token that is registered on a distributed ledger technology (DLT) infrastructure of blockchain. A tokenized security can be equity, a bond or an investment fund.</p>
<p>Tokenization is the process of converting ownership rights to an asset into a token. A tokenized security is essentially this blockchain-based tradable financial asset that can represent an investment in another asset.</p>
<p>A security is a negotiable financial asset that holds some type of value and can be broken down into different types. You have equity, which is an investment in common or preferred stock that is issued by another company. Then, you have debt, which represents money that has been borrowed and needs to be repaid. You also have investment funds, which are pools of capital that belong to numerous investors and are used to collectively purchase a security or an asset, with each investor retaining their individual percentage of ownership.</p>
<p>Discussing tokenized securities even further, they can also represent ownership in assets that are liquid, such as real estate and fine art. These tokens can then be traded easily which reduces the barriers of entry into the markets.</p>
<p>A token that actually represents ownership rights can be subdivided as well as traded with a record of all of the trades and ownership stored on a blockchain system. The distributed ledger technology, which is developed for cryptocurrencies, replaces the third-party recordkeepers. Blockchain technology runs complex algorithms in order to actually maintain the ledger of transactions and verify ownership. Through blockchain, these aforementioned tokens are created through security token offerings and are backed by tangible securities, while cryptocurrencies are regulated in the jurisdiction in which they are offered. </p>

<title>Tokenized Stocks</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/tokenized-stocks</url>
<file>tokenized-stocks.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Tokenized Stocks are the digital assets that are traded on exchanges using blockchain technology.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Tokenized Stocks?</h2>
<p>Tokenized stocks are typically created on top of the blockchain platforms. They offer a convenient way to represent assets.</p>
<p>Tokens give you the ability to trade stocks without having to worry about high brokerage fees, long settlement times, or any of the other gremlins that can plague your stock trading experience. These tokens are backed by  real stocks and there are many companies out there that will actually pay you dividends in Ether, Bitcoin, or other cryptos for holding such tokens.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: A company issues &quot;tokens&quot; on a blockchain and people buy them up. These tokens are backed by real stocks. For example, imagine if you owned Apple stock and were able to tokenize those shares so that you could sell them on an exchange. You would simply generate a token (which would represent one share of Apple), and then you would sell that token on an exchange (or a secondary market).</p>
<div>When you invest in the stock market, you're essentially buying shares of a company. But if you're not up for the task of buying and selling stock, there's an alternative — stocks that have been tokenized on blockchains.            </div>
<p>Tokenized stocks are essentially stocks in your pocket. You can hold them in a cryptocurrency wallet, sell them in an instant, and buy them with ease. No more waiting on long settlement delays or worrying about how long it'll take to get your money back if you want to sell early.</p>
<div>You can also trade them peer-to-peer, which means there's no exchange between you and the person who buys them from you — just like Bitcoin.</div>
<p>These tokenized stocks of several public companies are available via FTX. But if this trend catches on, we will see tokens for every public company out there — and that could change how we invest forever.</p>
<p>There are several potential benefits to tokenized stocks, including: </p>
<div>Tokenized assets are easily accessible, meaning they can improve the liquidity of particular stocks facing low liquidity problems.</div>
<p>Equity shares take longer to transfer compared to tokens. In fact, the transfer of tokenized stocks occurs almost instantly. </p>
<p>There's no need to deal with brokers or fund managers when using tokenized stocks, which means you don't have to worry about hidden fees or commissions. Some cryptocurrency exchanges don’t charge any trading fees either. </p>
<p>One of the main benefits of tokenized stocks is that they could make it easier for small investors to invest. It makes fractional ownership possible which means that you can purchase a fraction of the equity share in the form of a token.</p>
<p>Crypto exchanges operate 24/7, meaning you can trade tokenized stocks whenever you want. Traditional stock exchanges operate within a specified time only.</p>
<p>Along with benefits, there are some limitations of tokenized stocks as well. Token holders don’t have any voting rights, so they can’t become a part of the company’s decision-making process. </p>
<p>It’s important to always check with the rules of the company if you plan to invest in tokenized stocks.</p>

<title>Tokenomics</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/tokenomics</url>
<file>tokenomics.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Tokenomics is the science of token economy which consists of a set of rules that governs a cryptocurrency's launch and supply.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Tokenomics?</h2>
<div>Tokenomics, short for ‘token economics’ is an umbrella term used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts to describe how a token is used inside the project ecosystem, or how the token will follow a monetary policy as the project grows over time. As a result, the word tokenomics encompasses a wide range of activities and notions, some of which are hard-coded into the protocol of a blockchain and others that are more speculative in nature.</div>
<div>Tokenomics covers every important aspect of a digital token. The three main roles of tokenomics are as follows:</div>
<h2>Fundraising</h2>
<div>The tokenomics of a project determine how many funds it would raise when it is launched for the general public, the type of currency used for funding, and the schedule of distribution of tokens to the initial investors. This is also where an understanding of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) becomes important, where a project provides its initial tokens on specific criteria to a set number of investors to gain early capital at lower rates. </div>
<h2>Determining the Level of Governance of Holders</h2>
<div>Governance comes under the tokenomics section, as the holders of the project tokens on the blockchain have voting powers which they can use to voice their opinions about the digital token project. Important decisions can be made by token holders, such as project features, direction, and token economy changes, among other things. All of these decisions are outlined in the tokenomics section of a project.</div>
<h2>Ownership of the Digital Asset   </h2>
<div>Digital assets are used to signify the ownership of a crypto project. It is a common practice for many crypto projects to announce the allocation of their token supply in their official whitepaper. </div>
<p>Tokenomics allow holders and potential investors to understand the distribution standards of a token and judge the potential of an increase in the token’s price in the long run.</p>
<div>The main difference between a traditional economy and tokenomics is that the latter is designed for the world of decentralized cryptocurrencies, while conventional economics is built on multiple events of history and human behavior of a particular country. While many centralized institutions control the traditional economy, tokenomics gives the power back to the people, as they decide how a cryptocurrency project should be governed. </div>
<div>A major example of tokenomics is Bitcoin (BTC). The world's largest cryptocurrency is designed to mint only 21 million bitcoins in total. After regular intervals, miners are rewarded for their efforts accordingly. However, the number of rewarded Bitcoins has significantly reduced over the years, and this is exactly where tokenomics come into play, as they are designed to create scarcity and promote the price appreciation of a digital currency.</div>
<div>Tokenomics should be considered when investing in any cryptocurrency as they control the demand and supply of a token, which directly impacts the price. Here is a complete guide to understanding Tokenomics in detail: What Is Tokenomics?</div>

<title>TokenSets (Set Protocol)</title>

<file>tokensets-set-protocol.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>TokenSets is a Set Protocol-based decentralized platform for crypto portfolio management.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is TokenSets?</h2>
<div>TokenSets is a new smart contract platform from Set Protocol that allows for the creation and trading of baskets in the form of tokenized assets without having to write any code. It’s a decentralized protocol that enables automated portfolio management of multiple crypto assets. TokenSets was built to be easy to use for anyone, including those who are new to crypto and DeFi. </div>
<h2>How to Create a Portfolio on TokenSets?</h2>
<div>There’s a three-step process on portfolio creation on TokenSets’ website. After creating your portfolio, you can use a variety of options including rebalancing, managing, selling, etc.</div>
<p>It’s fairly easy to use with just a few things to be selected by you. TokenSets does the work on your part and you don’t have to be involved with the platform as is the case with many other applications. Users set parameters for a Set, and the Set will then automatically trade, rebalance, and execute strategies to meet the goals set by the user. </p>
<p>TokenSets provides traders with a simplified way to invest in sophisticated trading strategies, like buying and selling based on the price of an asset reaching certain levels. Users can simply specify their investment amount and get exposure to a strategy.</p>
<div>TokenSets works by allowing users to invest ETH or ERC-20 tokens into Set Tokens. These Set Tokens are ERC-20 tokens that represent a user's share in an underlying basket of assets owned by TokenSets. The user's share depends on the value of the underlying basket of assets.</div>
<p>Sets are digital assets that represent a diversified portfolio. They can contain one or more digital assets, and may also contain other Sets. The value of a Set is dependent on the values of the underlying assets it contains, weighted in accordance with their weightings. Its price is dynamically calculated at each block based on the prices of its underlying assets.</p>
<div>Sets allow users to obtain exposure to a basket of assets in one transaction, without having to manage and rebalance the portfolio themselves. Similar to ETFs, such as QQQ, DIA, or SPY, Sets provide investors with broad exposure to an asset class by investing in a single token (rather than buying many individual assets).</div>
<p>Here’s a summary of the benefits of Sets:</p>
<p>Exposure to a basket of tokens without owning each token.</p>
<div>Automatic portfolio rebalancing to maintain your desired allocation with every trade.</div>
<div>Add or remove liquidity to earn fees in exchange for providing liquidity to traders. </div>
<p>You can create your own Sets, which allows you to easily create and share your own token portfolios with others.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Toll Bridge?</h2>
<p>A toll bridge is a bridge powered by a smart contract where a monetary value called a toll fee unlocks access to extra functionalities. In the blockchain world, a toll fee is a key to unlocking vested cryptocurrencies.</p>
<div>A major blockchain project to initiate a toll bridge is DAO Maker, whose mission is to provide a safe and decentralized launchpad for startups.</div>
<div>The feature comes with the dynamic coin offering (DYCO) framework, which allows startups to seek investments and ensures project developers remain on course. With this fundraising model, investors have the option to request a refund in case the project veers off its original roadmap. </div>
<div>The smart contract handles factors such as toll bridge burns and claims. The toll bridge claims consider factors such as the vesting schedule and the days since the token generation event (TGE).</div>
<div>Using the bridge requires the MetaMask extension to connect to a whitelisted wallet. A successful connection gives the option to unlock funds from the bridge. Notably, the bridge allows token buyers to exit the vesting schedule before the time is over. However, they have to forfeit part of their tokens through burning.</div>
<div>Note that the more days the funds remain unlocked, the fewer the toll fees you pay when you exit before the vesting period is over. Note that users who go through the full vesting schedule without passing through the toll bridge get 20% of their locked coins every three months.</div>

<preview>Tor is a decentralized network that anonymizes users' web traffic by encrypting it and routing it through a series of relays before it reaches its final destination.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Tor?</h2>
<div>Originally named The Onion Router, Tor is a decentralized network that ensures anonymity by encrypting internet traffic and routing it through a series of servers before reaching its final destination. The network also uses its own &quot;.onion&quot; domain through which users can provide access to websites and services that can only be reached via the Tor network. It is maintained by the nonprofit Tor Project, which has also released Tor Browser — an open-source internet browser that automatically routes traffic through Tor.</div>
<p>The Tor network works by routing each user's traffic through three random nodes, or relays, before transmitting it to its endpoint. Each step of the journey is independently encrypted, and each relay is only aware of where the traffic came from immediately prior and where it is going directly afterward, meaning that by design, no node can ever know the complete path of any traffic.</p>
<div>The network is perhaps most widely known for its use as a gateway to dark web sites and marketplaces accessible through &quot;.onion&quot; addresses. The most infamous of these marketplaces was the now-shuttered Silk Road, where users could anonymously purchase illicit goods such as drugs and fake driver's licenses with Bitcoin (BTC). However, Tor is also used by journalists, activists, dissidents, law enforcement agencies, intelligence services and others who need to remain anonymous online to ensure their safety and security.</div>

<title>Total Exchange Volume</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-exchange-volume</url>
<file>total-exchange-volume.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Total exchange volume is a measure of the total value that has been traded on an exchange(s).</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Total Exchange Volume?</h2>
<p>Total exchange volume is the total amount of cryptocurrency that has been exchanged on a given cryptocurrency exchange. Each day, it is tracked and recorded on the blockchain for almost all cryptocurrency exchanges. The number can be found on each exchange's website. Totals are updated every 24 hours.</p>
<p>You can think of it as the amount of money being traded on currency exchange, but for digital currencies.</p>
<h2>What Is the Daily Exchange Volume?</h2>
<p>Daily exchange volume is the amount of currency that has been traded (bought and sold) in the last 24 hours. </p>
<h2>Importance of Total Exchange Volume</h2>
<p>Total exchange volume is a key indicator for cryptocurrency traders because it shows how much value is being traded on an exchange. The higher the number, the more liquid the exchange is. By extension, it's easier to trade large amounts of cryptocurrency on exchanges with higher total exchange volumes.</p>
<div>Total exchange volume is a more accurate measure of value than market cap because it takes into account several factors that affect value. It not only measures supply and demand but also active use cases and the growth potential of a cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>One of the most important influencers in the cryptocurrency market is volume. Volume within a certain market can dictate where a specific cryptocurrency will trade, and how valuable it is overall. High-volume markets tend to have liquidity and lower volatility, which makes them attractive to traders. Low-volume markets may not have enough liquidity to support price movements when large orders are placed.</p>
<p>The main function of exchange volume is to show how well prices are holding their ground during periods of high activity. If prices are making new highs on light volume, for example, it suggests that buyers aren't yet convinced that an upward move is sustainable.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The total amount of coins in existence right now, minus any coins that have been verifiably burned. *see Circulating Supply and Max Supply.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Total Supply?</h2>
<p>The total supply metric reflects the coins that have already been created or mined. </p>
<p>Not all coins included in this metric are available for use and coins that have been burned are not included. </p>
<div>This is in contrast to circulating supply, which calculates all tokens or coins that have been mined and can be used. It excludes coins which can be created but are yet to do so. </div>
<div>Circulating supply rather than total supply is used to calculate the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency. The former is usually more reflective as cryptocurrency prices are normally affected by coins and tokens that can be used rather than those that are inaccessible.</div>
<p>Total supply includes coins that have been locked as a result of either pre-mined coins intentionally kept out of circulation and tokens that are locked in smart contracts.</p>
<div>Tokens can be locked in smart contracts until a particular purpose has been achieved, such as some stages of an ICO of a certain cryptocurrency.</div>
<p>Total supply can be an important indicator of a cryptocurrency’s profitability and whether investors should invest in a virtual currency.</p>
<p>For example, a large gap between circulating supply and the total supply can have implications for future profitability.</p>
<p>Many tokens set to come to the market can exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices.</p>
<p>Total supply cannot be used to determine the maximum number of tokens or coins that can ever be mined.</p>
<p>In the case of BTC, the maximum amount that can ever be created is capped at 21 million, although it is estimated that around four million BTC are missing or considered “lost”.</p>

<preview>Тotal value locked represents the number of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Total Value Locked (TVL)?</h2>
<p>If you have been using DeFi tracking sites, the chances are high that you have run into total value locked (TVL) as a reference point. To put it simply, total value locked represents the number of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol: this value is not meant to represent the number of outstanding loans, but rather the total amount of underlying supply that is being secured by a specific application by DeFi completely.</p>
<p>Total value locked is a metric that is used to measure the overall health of the DeFi and yielding market. You can track total value locked on many services. </p>
<p>There are three main factors that are taken into consideration when calculating and looking at decentralized financial service's market cap TVL ratio: calculating the supply, the maximum supply as well as the current price.</p>
<p>In order to get the current market cap, you need to multiply the circulating supply by the current price. In order to get to the TVL ratio, you would need to take that market cap number and divide it by the TVL of the service.</p>
<p>From a theoretical standpoint, the higher the TVL ratio is, the lower the value of an asset needs to be; however, this is not always the case when we look at reality. One of the easiest ways to implement the TVL ratio is to help determine if a DeFi asset is undervalued or overvalued, and this can be done by looking at the ratio. If it is under 1, it is undervalued in most cases. </p>

<h2>What Is Trade Volume?</h2>
<p>Trade volume reflects the amount of cryptocurrency that is bought and sold in a single day.</p>
<p>It's an important metric as it can indicate changes in crypto trends.</p>
<p>For example, if a coin which normally has a low trading volume experiences a spike, it may signal a changing trend such as growing institutional interest.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a cryptocurrency which normally has high overall trading volume experiences a dip in its 24-hour volume, it may mean demand for the cryptocurrency is waning.</p>
<p>Investors often evaluate a cryptocurrency’s volume to make predictions about the future downward or upward movement of prices.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Trading Bot?</h2>
<p>You might have seen or heard the term trading bot in the world of cryptocurrencies. To give you a bit more of a perspective on what it actually is, in order to actually make a profit in crypto trading, you will often need to buy and sell assets quickly by certain methods or tactics implemented by traders. As a result, even a minor delay in the trade-offs can incur noticeable losses, and this is why many cryptocurrency traders out there have started implementing a trading bot into their methods.</p>
<p>Now you might be asking yourself, what exactly is a trading bot?</p>
<p>A crypto trading bot is essentially a program that is designed to automate cryptocurrency asset trading on the behalf of the trader. The investor or trader would normally have to sit in front of their display and pick the cryptocurrency they want to buy and sell and at what time they want to buy or sell it. They need to always pay attention to the market statistics that play a critical role in the trading process.</p>
<p>Through a trading bot, this process can easily be automated, and the analysis and interpretation of the market statistics is actually done by the trading bot. This means that the trading bot can gather data, interpret it, calculate the potential market risk and execute the buying and selling of cryptocurrency assets. For example, you can set up a crypto trading bot to purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum when the price goes lower than a specific limit, or sell it when it goes just over a specific limit. This way, the trading bot can actually save you a lot of time and effort, and it will essentially fill the role of buying, selling or trading the cryptocurrencies for you while you just sit back, relax and hopefully watch your profits grow.</p>
<p>Trading bots are essentially automated programs that can do the process of buying, selling or trading cryptocurrencies on behalf of the investors. They are coded to make these decisions based on a pre-coded threshold — think of this along the lines of if the cryptocurrency asset in question has gone above or below a certain value, and where it can be bought or sold in that regard. </p>
<p>Trading bots work in that they feature certain components. They have market data analysis modules for example, which means that trading bots will save raw market data from different sources and interpret it. The trading bots will also decide whether to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency asset based on the data that it has collected. Many trading bots will allow you as a trader to customize which types of data go into the signal generator sector to get refined results. You also have a module known as the market risk prediction module, where it uses market data to calculate the potential risk in the market. Now, based on the information, the trading bots will decide how much to invest or trade, and this is one of the most crucial aspects when it comes to crypto trading bots.</p>
<p>You also have the module that allows the bot to use APIs to buy or sell the cryptocurrency asset in a strategic way. You might want to avoid buying tokens in bulk, and some situations can call for purchasing tokens immediately, and the execution module found in the trading bots can take care of situations such as this one. </p>
<p>When it comes to the advantages of trading bots, they are efficient and never need to sleep due to the fact that they are, well, robots, and they are a lot more powerful and quick than a human trader can ever be due to the fact that they have all of their information pre-coded and can process a lot of information at any given time.</p>

<h2>What Are Trading Tournaments?</h2>
<p>Trading tournaments are one of the most popular ways to make a profit from your crypto holdings. These are exclusive crypto trading events organized by spot and derivative crypto exchanges, offering traders a unique way to test their knowledge of the cryptocurrency market and rewarding them for their skills.</p>
<p>Since the crypto industry is fiercely competitive with new platforms and innovations launched regularly, trading platforms organize trading tournaments to attract new users and motivate them to trade. </p>
<p>These competitions come with specific requirements and different formats, each designed to fine-tune the user’s skills and contribute to new trading techniques and tactics. In general, trading tournaments involve speculating on selected cryptocurrency price movements and buying and selling the underlying coins via an authorized exchange or a CFD (contract for difference) trading account.</p>
<p>Although the rules and rewards may vary, crypto trading tournaments usually reward traders with the highest trading volume of a specific coin/token for the tournament duration. </p>
<p>Some of the frequently used terminologies used in trading tournaments include:</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Тrading volume refers to the total number of shares (or tokens/coins) that have been exchanged between buyers and sellers of a given asset during trading hours of a certain day.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Trading Volume?</h2>
<p>Trading volume is the number of completed trades in a single security or across the whole market in a given time period. If shares in security are traded 500 times a day, the total volume for that day is 500.</p>
<p>However, if a number of traders took positions in the security during the same day and closed them out by the end of the session, the trading volume has the chance of potentially being greater than the total of positions open at either the start of the closing of that specific day’s trading.</p>
<p>That being said, trading volume is a technical indicator due to the fact that it represents the overall activity of a security or a market, and investors often use trading volume to confirm the existence or a continuation of a trend or trend reversal. Trading volume can legitimize the price action of security, and this can then aid an investor when it comes to buying or selling the specific security in question.</p>
<p>Trading volume can help an investor identify momentum in a security and confirm a trend as a result: if the trading volume increases, then the price will move in a similar direction most of the time. This is the case if security is continuation higher in an uptrend, and the volume of the security will also increase.</p>
<p>When you analyze the trading volume, there is a basic framework that you can adhere to with respect to using volume in order to improve your trading. You can use the volume to determine the weakness or strength of a move, and the stronger the moving volume, the stronger the momentum. The idea here is that a trader should be a lot more inclined to join stronger moves and avoid weaker moves.</p>
<p>As such, trading volume refers to the total number of shares (or tokens/coins) that have been exchanged between buyers and sellers of a given asset during trading hours of a certain day. This volume is a measure of liquidity and activity.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The act of exchanging cryptocurrencies on a blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Transaction (TX)?</h2>
<p>Every transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger technology. </p>
<div>Cryptography is the name of the process by which transaction data and the ledger are encrypted. </div>
<div>Crypto transactions are decentralized — meaning that, unlike with fiat money, no central bank or authority regulates or controls the transaction. </div>
<div>Peers engage in transactions with one another by using crypto wallets. </div>
<p>The individual who starts the transaction transfers the funds from the public address to another account. </p>
<p>For the transaction to successfully take place, the private key is required. </p>
<p>The transactions made are encrypted before they are broadcasted on the distributed ledger. </p>
<p>The amount of the transaction can be publicly viewed but the identity of the sender remains anonymous. </p>
<p>Multiple transactions can be added at once to the blockchain using blocks. </p>
<div>The people who add blocks of the transaction are typically called miners or validators. </div>
<p>The time taken for a transaction to be recorded on the blockchain can vary depending on the network being used, and the size of the transaction fee that was paid.</p>
<p>A transaction can be instant, or it can take up to a few minutes for the transaction to go through. </p>
<p>If traffic is exceptionally high, the transaction could even take a few hours to show up. </p>
<p>When in doubt whether the transaction has been successfully made, the status of the transaction on the distributed ledger can be checked by using the block explorer of the coin sent. </p>

<file>transaction-fee.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A payment for using the blockchain to transact.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Transaction Fee?</h2>
<div>A transaction fee is paid when a certain amount of cryptocurrency is transferred from one wallet to another. </div>
<p>Transaction fees are flexible in nature and can vary based on how busy the blockchain is. </p>
<p>A user who wants to expedite a transaction can choose to do so by paying a higher transaction fee. </p>
<div>Miners, or people who are paid to verify transactions, will then typically prioritize the transaction. </div>
<div>Most transaction fees are fixed on cryptocurrency exchanges. </div>
<p>However, some users can adjust fees if they are using cryptocurrency wallets. </p>
<p>Transaction fees were initially created to spur malicious or fraudulent activity on Bitcoin’s network. </p>
<div>By levying fees, the hope was that the costs would prevent Bitcoin from becoming overloaded or clogged up. </div>
<div>Bitcoin’s inventor Satoshi Nakamoto introduced transaction fees after being inspired by Adam Back’s hash system. </div>
<div>The hash system was based on the principles of Proof-of-Work. </div>
<p>Other blockchains have enforced similar fees to keep the process of mining intact and productive. </p>
<p>All Bitcoin transactions reach a queue called memory pool, also called mempool. </p>
<p>If the mempool is overloaded, the miners will choose which transactions to verify first. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency transactions that have higher fees are prioritized first. </p>
<p>Hence, several cryptocurrency users may wish to increase fees if they deem their transaction to be timely or urgent. </p>
<div>Ethereum fees are measured in gas, which can be described as a small fraction of ETH. </div>
<p>Transaction fees play a more prominent role in Ethereum compared with Bitcoin as the former provides more sophisticated features including smart contracts and decentralized apps. </p>

<title>Transaction Triggers</title>

<file>transaction-triggers.txt</file>
<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>Triggers can be set up on a blockchain, which group various transactions together to be executed when the designated conditions are met.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Transaction Triggers?</h2>
<div>Blockchains are made up of a series of individual blocks of data, and can be thought of as a decentralized distributed ledger. Each block contains information about transactions conducted within a given time period, and also has a unique identifier (known as a hash) to differentiate them from other blocks in the chain.</div>
<div>Transactions executed on-chain are considered valid only when the blockchain has been updated to reflect them on the public ledger. They must be validated by a number of the network's participants, who are called miners or validators, depending on the chain. This offers security and transparency as no one is able to change the data once the block has been verified and recorded on the network.</div>
<p>Thus, triggers can be set up, which group various transactions together to be executed when the designated conditions are met.</p>
<p>This can provide added convenience and assurance for users in various ways. For example, a stop loss order can be set to trigger on decentralized platforms by users when the price of the assets they have borrowed plunges to a certain threshold, to close their positions to mitigate losses and manage risk. </p>
<div>As cryptocurrencies are volatile assets and prices can fluctuate too quickly for users to react, this can prove to be essential especially during bear markets or negative market conditions, and eliminate the need for constant monitoring, which can be impractical and time consuming. </div>
<div>In bull markets or healthy market conditions, the reverse is also true, as users can set automated transactions to trigger. One such example would be in the form of limit orders on decentralized exchanges to take profits when the cryptocurrencies increase to desired price levels. </div>

<title>Transactions Per Second (TPS)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/transactions-per-second</url>
<file>transactions-per-second.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Transactions per second (TPS) is a measure of a computer system's (or network's) capacity to perform transactions or calculations in a second.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Transactions Per Second (TPS)?</h2>
<p>Transactions per second (TPS) refers to the maximum number of transactions that can be processed by a computer system within a certain amount of time. For example, PayPal's TPS is around 193 transactions per second and VISA is capable of processing up to 1,700 transactions per second. </p>
<p>When it comes to TPS of blockchain networks, the maximum transactions per second that is done in the world of crypto is 50,000 (by Solana network). </p>
<p>This measurement can be useful when evaluating blockchains for their ability to process real-world transactions. However, there are several factors that complicate this simple comparison:</p>
<p>The block time defines how quickly the blockchain confirms transactions. For bitcoin, the block time averages 10 minutes, which means that the network processes about seven transactions per second. </p>
<p>Different blockchains vary significantly in terms of the data transmitted with each transaction. A simple Bitcoin transaction can be as small as 226 bytes or as large as 500 bytes. Higher transaction sizes lead to higher processing times on the blockchain.</p>
<p>It is the amount of data about transactions a block can carry in blockchain. The bigger the block, the more people are needed to run a full node.  </p>
<p>If you have the information about the above factors, it’s easy to calculate TPS. </p>
<p>Let’s say a blockchain has a block size of 1MB, the average transaction size of 1kb, and a block time of 30 seconds: its TPS would be 33. Anyone who has the information about these factors can calculate the TPS using the following formula:</p>
<p>(Block size/Transaction size) / Block time = Transactions Per Second</p>
<p>Some blockchains out there have staggering TPS but that doesn’t guarantee them to succeed at the top level or even compete with the likes of Ethereum and Bitcoin. It’s important to look into the performance, security, and other critical aspects of such blockchains because they might be compromised to have a high TPS rate.</p>
<p>The scalability issue has already been identified as a problem by many blockchain projects. </p>
<p>Popular blockchain technologies have come under a lot of scrutinies due to the transaction rates that are achievable at the moment. Many people have compared current blockchain technology to early internet systems which did not have much capacity either. However, they were able to scale up rapidly after a period. Given the attention this issue has received, it’s fair to assume that the popular blockchain technologies can sidestep traditional payment processors’ TSP at some point. </p>

<title>TRC-10 (TRON)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/trc-10-tron</url>
<file>trc-10-tron.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>TRC10 is a technological token standard that does not require the TRON Virtual Machine and is backed by the TRON blockchain network (TVM).</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a TRC-10 (TRON)?</h2>
<div>Unlike the TRC20 token, TRC-10 is a native token on the TRON blockchain that is utilized for basic token production and does not need the TRON Virtual Machine (TVM).</div>
<div>TRC-10 can be accessed through an API (application programming interface). TRC-10 has 1,000 times lower transaction fees than TRC20, but it necessitates additional bandwidth for API transactions and deposits.</div>
<div>Any account user on the TRON network can create a TRC-10 token for a minimum of 1,024 TRX. Account-holders on the network can also lock up their token individually. </div>
<div>The issuer must specify a token name, overall value, TRX conversion rate, circulation length, definition, maximum bandwidth points per account, overall bandwidth points usage, and token stake when producing tokens.</div>
<div>TRON is a blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts, virtual machines, decentralized exchanges, decentralized applications, smart contracts, wallets, and blockchain explorers. </div>
<div>TRC-10 tokens were once part of the Ethereum blockchain until TRON's mainnet was launched, at which stage the tokens were exchanged and moved to their own blockchain network. They work with all major crypto wallets and, in many cases, are completely free to use.</div>
<div>When TRC-10 tokens are utilized in an ICO project, there are no listing fees to pay, and to develop TRC-10 tokens, no prior experience of programming languages is necessary. TRC-10 tokens' supply can be raised once they are created and they can also be burned if the tokens are returned to their originating address.</div>
<div>A user must have at least 1,024 TRX in their wallet to get a TRC-10 token. They are used in initial coin offerings (ICOs), blockchain-powered products, and as a payment method in decentralized applications (DApps). They have been utilized by well-known initiatives like BitTorrent token, a decentralized file-sharing service whose development process is made easier and simpler by the existence of a flexible blockchain network.</div>
<div>TRC-10 token has a high speed and is easily scalable, plus it is accessible via smart contracts and APIs.</div>
<div>In smart contracts, they are easily transferable, mintable, and upgradeable and users are not protected in the event that they misplace their TRC-10 tokens.</div>
<p>Furthermore, TRC-10 features a built-in tracking system and its transaction costs are a thousand times cheaper than those of TRC20 tokens.</p>
<div>TRON transactions are carried out using bandwidth points. Every TRON account receives around 5,000 free bandwidth points per day. TRC-10 is obtained when TRX holders freeze their tokens in an appropriate wallet. When tokens are moved via smart contracts, both bandwidth points and energy are spent, which is why TRON smart contracts need energy to be processed.</div>
<div>TRC-10 tokens let users experience faster download speeds than decentralized file-sharing systems.</div>
<p>TRC-10 tokens are utilized in a variety of industries, including banking and finance, real estate, retail, healthcare, supply chain management, education, gaming, media, the Internet of Things, augmented reality, virtual reality, and aviation. </p>

<preview>The TRC-20 token standard allows for tokens to be created on the TRON network.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a TRC-20 Token?</h2>
<div>The TRC-20 token standard allows for tokens to be created on the TRON network. It defines the functions that need to be implemented so that a token can be accepted as a standard TRC20 token.</div>
<div>The TRC-20 standard is similar to the ERC-20 standard used for Ethereum tokens and is intended to be fully compatible with it.</div>
<p>For the TRC-20 protocol to work correctly, the token's contract is required to implement several functions. There are three optional items and six required items that need to be defined in TRC-20 token development. </p>
<p>The following are some of the functions that are used in TRON's TRC20 implementation. </p>
<p>Optional items:</p>
<p>Name</p>
<p>Abbreviation</p>
<p>Precision</p>
<p>Required items:</p>
<p>totalSupply</p>
<p>balanceOf</p>
<p>transfer</p>
<p>transferFrom</p>
<p>approve</p>
<p>allowance</p>
<p>TRON Virtual Machine is a lightweight, complete VM. Its purpose is to offer millions of developers a custom-built system for an efficient, easy, safe, and scalable blockchain. </p>
<div>Before TVM was launched on May 25th, 2018, TRON had already been working on some additional functions to improve the security and usability of the protocol. TVM makes TRON more secure and robust without compromising the high TPS (transaction per second). It also enables compatibility with Ethereum. The TVM will be fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts by using its own pluggable smart contract engine. Ultimately, this compatibility will allow Ethereum developers to easily migrate their smart contracts onto the TRON network.</div>
<p>TRON blockchain is an open-source protocol serving the digital content distribution space. It extends its support for several blockchains and smart contract systems. These include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many public blockchain networks. TRON offers a multiprotocol infrastructure to developers for application development in the digital entertainment industry, allowing users to benefit from smooth multiprotocol smart networks.</p>
<p>It uses its own cryptocurrency (TRX) to enable access to different services offered on its platform. Customers can pay using TRX for the services they use. The platform enables one-on-one interaction between consumers of content and the content creators.</p>
<div>The TRON network is secured by Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), which means that the stakeholders of TRX elect Super Representatives who are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the network. </div>

<title>Treasury Bills (T-Bills)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/treasury-bills-t-bills</url>
<file>treasury-bills-t-bills.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Treasury bills (T-Bills) are short-term U.S. government debt obligations.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Are Treasury Bills (T-Bills)?</h2>
<p>Treasury bills (T-Bills) are essentially short-term U.S. government debt obligations that are backed by the Treasury Department with a maturity in a year or less.</p>
<p>Treasury bills are typically sold in denominations of $1,000, and some can even reach a maximum denomination of $5 million when in non-competitive bids.</p>
<p>As such, these securities are widely regarded as a low-risk as well as a secure investment.</p>
<p>The U.S. government issues treasury bills to fund different public projects, for example, the construction of highways, and when an investor purchases a treasury bill, the U.S. government is writing an &quot;I owe you&quot; letter to the investors. This means that treasury bills are considered safe as well as conservative investments since the U.S. government backs them.</p>
<p>Treasury bills are held until their maturity date; however, some holders might want to cash out before the maturity and realize the short-term interest gains through reselling the investment to the secondary market.</p>
<p>Discussing treasury bill maturities, they can have maturities of just a few days up to a maximum of 52 weeks. Keep in mind that the longer a maturity date is, the higher the interest rate that the treasury bill will pay to the investor.</p>
<p>Treasury bills are issued at a discount from the face value of the bill, and this means that the purchase is less than the face value of the bill itself.</p>
<p>Over time, when the treasury bill ends up maturing, the investor is paid the face value of the bill they bought. If the face value amount is greater than the purchase price, the difference is in the interest earned for the investor. Keep in mind that treasury bills do not pay regular interest payments as with a coupon bond, for example; however, a treasury bill does have an interest which is reflected on the amount it pays when it ends up maturing. </p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The treasury bond is a debt security issued by the United States government that is backed by the &quot;full faith and credit&quot; of the U.S. Treasury Department.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Treasury Bond?</h2>
<p>Treasury bonds are issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to raise money for the federal government to meet its expenses. With a treasury bond, you lend money to the government for a set amount of time. In return, you receive semiannual interest payments until the bonds mature or are repurchased by the government at face value.</p>
<div>Treasury bonds are used to raise funds for the federal government. They are different from treasury bills (T-Bills) in that they have a long maturity date, ranging from 10 to 30 years.</div>
<div>T-bonds have provided a safe haven in times of financial uncertainty, and they make a good addition to any portfolio in which you want some fixed-income assets.</div>
<h2>Buying and Selling Treasury Bonds</h2>
<p>Treasury bonds do not trade on an exchange as stocks do. Instead, they are bought and sold directly on a secondary market. This means that an investor can buy or sell treasury bonds anytime the investor wishes, as opposed to stocks that trade on exchanges during specific hours of the day.</p>
<p>You can buy treasury bonds via an online auction that’s held by the Treasury Department. </p>
<p>You can either hold the bond until its maturity and receive interest after every six months or sell it before it matures. If you are looking to sell treasury bonds, it is best to do this through a broker in the secondary market. When selling before maturity, the seller may receive a lower amount than the investment made initially. </p>
<h2>Advantages of Treasury Bonds</h2>
<p>Treasury bonds are highly regarded and generally dependable investments. They offer a consistent interest rate and are backed by the government. The government doesn't guarantee that it will always be able to pay its debts in full, but it's rare for the federal government to default on its obligations.</p>
<div>Treasury bonds are traded over-the-counter (OTC) and can be bought directly from the Federal Reserve Bank, brokerage firms registered with regulatory bodies, like SEC or CFTC, or mutual fund companies or dealers authorized by them.</div>
<p>It’s one of the most certain ways to establish a steady stream of income. Treasury bonds pay semiannual interest until they mature. </p>
<p>Treasury bonds can be sold anytime in the secondary market, meaning there’s so much liquidity to them. </p>
<h2>Disadvantages of Treasury Bonds</h2>
<p>Treasury bonds are known to be a very safe investment, but they do have some disadvantages that range from low-interest rates to lower prices when sold before maturity. </p>
<p>The interest payments on treasury bonds provide an income stream, but they may not be enough to keep pace with inflation or other forms of investment income.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that treasury bonds, like any other investment, have risks or drawbacks associated with them. Make sure to understand them properly and make an informed decision.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Trojan?</h2>
<p>A trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. The trojan can be employed by cyber-criminals and hackers that are trying to get access to your system. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering in order to load and execute the trojan files on their system, and once they are activated, the trojan can enable the cyber-criminals to actually spy on you, steal any of your sensitive data or gain backdoor access to your system and manipulate your files.</p>
<p>The term “trojan” actually derives from the ancient Greek story about the deceptive Trojan horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy. Now, your computer is not the city of Troy, but can fall just as well, since a trojan operates similarly due to the fact that it hides within harmless programs or tries to trick you into downloading it. The name was originally coined in a US Air Force report in 1974, which speculated that computers could potentially be compromised.</p>
<p>Now, you will oftentimes encounter people which address a “trojan” as a trojan virus or a trojan horse virus; however, these terms can be misleading. The trojan itself cannot self-replicate but spreads through pretending to be useful software or content while secretly containing malicious instructions.</p>
<p>A trojan has to be executed by the victim in order to work. It can infect the device in several ways. If a user falls victim to a phishing or other social engineering attack by opening an infected email, they can activate the trojan. Attackers can also install a trojan through exploiting a software vulnerability or through unauthorized access. Hackers can create even fake Wi-Fi hotspots networks that look like the one a user is trying to connect to, and when the user inevitably does, they can be redirected to fake websites that contain browser exploits that can predict any file that they try to download.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Truffle?</h2>
<div>For blockchains using EVM, truffle acts as a development environment and a testing framework, a widely used tool for blockchain application development. It was developed by Tim Coulter in 2015 when he struggled to find tools to develop dApps. The reason behind the development of Truffle was to make dApps development easier for developers. In 2020, ConsenSys acquired the team and technology of Truffle Suite. </div>
<div>Creating a dApp (decentralized app) in Ethereum involves navigating many layers and packages: Solidity, Web3.js, truffle-contract, testrpc, ganache-cli, geth, webpack. Truffle aims to unify all of these into a single CLI tool from the NodeJS ecosystem that you'll be able to use regardless of whether you're writing a smart contract or building a frontend app.</div>
<h2>What Is a Truffle Suite?</h2>
<p>It’s a collection of three tools; Truffle, Ganache, and Drizzle. At its core, Truffle Suite is an ecosystem to develop decentralized apps. It is widely popular among dApps developers because it supports the complete development process. Thanks to its vibrant and thriving community, Truffle Suite has been a point of attraction for aspiring and new developers as well.</p>
<p>The major component of Truffle Suite is Truffle. It is a development environment that specializes in smart contract development. With its wide range of valuable functionalities, dApps development is much easier for developers – this ease resonates with its slogan “Smart Contracts Made Sweeter” as well.</p>
<p>Truffle automates the compiling and packaging of Solidity code into bytecode that is sent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It also simplifies the process of integrating your dApp with front-end development tools.</p>
<p>While Ganache is commonly referred to as a personal Blockchain, it should be considered more like a Bitcoin/Ethereum simulator. It is a component of Truffle Suite that was created to test apps by simulating the blockchain. This allows them to make sure that their code will work properly with real blockchain transactions.</p>
<p>The best way to think of Ganache is as a big bank ledger (database) with some basic functionalities like creating accounts, creating and sending transactions, etc. It is an excellent way to learn the effectiveness of your code and test your smart contracts in a local environment before deploying them to the blockchain.</p>
<div>It is another valuable component of Truffle Suite with front-end development libraries. Its primary function is to offer ease of creating a smooth user interface of dApps. The core of Drizzle is based on the Redux store, which takes the hassle out of synchronizing contract data, transaction data, and more. Front-end development becomes much more accessible and predictable with Drizzle.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Trust?</h2>
<div>A trust is a fiduciary relationship in which one party, known as a trustor, gives another party, the trustee, the right to hold title to property or assets for the benefit of a third party, the beneficiary. Trusts are established to provide legal protection for the trustor’s assets, to make sure those are distributed according to the wishes of the trustor, and to save time, reduce paperwork and, in some cases, avoid or reduce inheritance or estate taxes. A trust is a legal entity employed to hold property, so the assets remain in a safe environment. </div>
<div>Some cryptocurrency investors also choose to keep their assets in a trust because they are further protected from some of the risks associated with traditional services. Trusts are also used for an added layer of protection and privacy.</div>
<div>In the digital economy, many trust companies are able to provide institutional-grade custodial controls for a variety of assets, including additional security and protection from counterparties, hacking, and theft, as well as provide greater transparency and reporting. Trust companies are hired to act as fiduciaries, and hence, they can make all of the investment decisions and work in the best interest of its client. This is helpful to those who are inexperienced and lack knowledge of the digital economy.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Trustlessness?</h2>
<p>A trustless system requires no parties to know one another or trust one another. </p>
<div>The concept of trustlessness is considered the bedrock of cryptocurrencies.</div>
<div>It was first introduced first by Bitcoin, the flagship and first cryptocurrency that was created. </div>
<p>This is because BTC enabled all transactional data to be verified and stored on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies. </p>
<div>Trustless systems enable participants to carry out transactions in a peer-to-peer (P2P) setting.</div>
<p>It enables individuals to place trust in abstract concepts rather than in people. </p>
<p>Trustless systems are the opposite of centralized systems, such as banks.</p>
<p>This is because traditional financial services involve using an authority to verify data and make decisions. </p>
<div>Centralized systems are considered vulnerable to theft and hacks. </div>
<p>There is also the possibility of data being altered or manipulated. </p>
<p>This is not to say that cryptocurrencies cannot be hacked — however, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the ability to not have to place trust under a central body is often touted as one of the biggest strengths of crypto assets. </p>
<p>Centralized systems are undoubtedly more popular than decentralized systems. </p>
<p>But one key advantage trustless systems have over decentralized systems is that they can completely be governed by a computer code. </p>
<div>Bitcoin and Proof-of-Work blockchains try to secure trustlessness through providing rewards and economic incentives for solving problems.</div>
<p>Maintaining network security is often rewarded with monetary incentives. </p>
<p>This is done by distributing trust through several participants. </p>
<p>Blockchain is usually considered immune to major hacks, and single points of failure are typically eliminated. </p>

<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A mixing service that helps make cryptocurrency funds and transactions more anonymous.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Tumbler?</h2>
<p>Tumblers are responsible for breaking down transactions into smaller parts — and mixing them with others.</p>
<p>This makes transactions harder for third parties to hunt down.</p>
<div>Users deposit their coins into the tumbler’s pool. The tumbler will return each user the same number of coins, minus the fees. However, the funds received will be made up of a multitude of parts of the funds that other users have deposited into the system.</div>
<p>This helps to create a divide between the address sending crypto, and the one that is receiving it.</p>
<p>Tumblers usually do not ask for information about their users, ensuring anonymity.</p>
<div>As a result, tumblers are often accused of enabling illicit activities like money laundering, given that they make the anonymous applications of the Dark Web much more convenient and the jobs of law enforcement agencies more difficult.</div>
<p>However, tumbling cryptocurrency does not always carry suspicious motives.</p>
<div>Users who resort to mixing should bear in mind that tumblers’ manipulations carry a few dangers, notably the risk of hacking. In case of security holes, it would be easy for hackers to recover personal data or trace the origin of a user’s coins.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Turing-Complete?</h2>
<p>In order to be called Turing complete, a system has to be able to do what a Turing machine — a theoretical machine developed by mathematician Alan Turing — can do.</p>
<p>Most computer programming languages in use today are Turing complete, but it is not necessary for blockchains to fit this requirement.</p>
<div>For example, Solidity, the programming language used to write Ethereum smart contracts, is Turing complete. Conversely, when a language is not Turing complete, it has some restrictions that prevent it from solving all kinds of computational problems.</div>
<div>Bitcoin is not Turing complete by design. That’s because it was designed as a cryptocurrency and just allows simple functionalities such as transferring values.</div>
<p>An important feature of a Turing-complete language is loops, which allow the programming language to do a set of instructions over and over again.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s scripting language is not equipped with this. The reason this blockchain is not Turing complete is to prevent spams and network overload.</p>

<file>two-factor-authentication-2fa.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is method of access that requires two different forms of authentication.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h2>
<div>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a method through which you can establish access to an online account or even a computer system that requires you to enter two different types of information. This is a common feature found on many cryptocurrency exchanges, where people, aside from setting a secure password, can have an additional means of getting access to their account or hot wallet.</div>
<p>In other words, you can enter the password, after which you will end up being prompted to enter an additional piece of information such as a security code. This security code will then be sent either to you through a mobile SMS, or through email. There is also phone verification, where your phone will be called and the code will be read to you by a voice assistant, or something similar. Essentially anything that requires more than just a simple password in order to provide you with access to a specific account can be considered two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>In other words, the first factor here is the password itself, while the second factor is a text with a code, or it can even be biometrics.</p>
<p>As for the biometric way of conducting two-factor authentication, you have three common options. For one, you scan your fingerprints, and since a lot of smartphones nowadays have a fingerprint sensor built-in, a lot of people tend to go with this route as it is quick and simple. The second is, of course, scanning your face. Most modern smartphones have 3D cameras that can scan your face efficiently from many angles, and this, in turn, allows for a higher level of security. In other words, someone cannot really open a picture of your face on their smartphone and manage to confirm that they are you, since it needs a full 3D model of your face in order to unlock. Last, you have one of the most complicated and rare kinds of biometric authentication, and this is through your retina.</p>

<title>Type Checking</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/type-checking</url>
<file>type-checking.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>A process in programming languages to verify whether or not each operation in the program is in accordance with the type declaration rules of the language.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Type Checking?</h2>
<p>Type checking is usually performed by a compiler that verifies that all operations have received a proper number of arguments and data types. There are two types of systems, namely:</p>
<p>In static type checking, there is no need to run a program to check it. The compiler performs static type checking at compile time. </p>
<p>Static type checking is useful when there are errors in your program as they can be detected before running it. It helps in improving reliability and security. </p>
<p>An example for static type checking is C language, where you have to declare variables before using them in your program. If you don't declare them, then the compiler will show an error, and you will not be able to execute your program.</p>
<p>Dynamic type checking does not occur until runtime or execution time. Dynamic type checking is useful as it allows us to write programs without prior knowledge about types. In scenarios where we need to check types at runtime only.</p>
<p>The most common form of type checking involves assigning a data type to each variable, parameter and function return value in a computer program. Based on the types assigned to these values, the appropriate operations are allowed (e.g., adding two integer variables to produce another integer or concatenating two strings to produce another string). Type checking ensures that these operations are valid for their intended purposes.</p>
<p>In some programming languages (for example C), type-checking is performed by the compiler; in others (for example PHP), it can be deferred until run time (in which case it may be called dynamic type checking).</p>
<p>Some languages allow the programmer to define new types, so that their programs can use those types in their algorithms. Other languages allow the programmer to associate arbitrary properties with values at run time.</p>
<p>Many languages involve both approaches; for example, Java provides pre-defined types and allows programmers to create new classes or extend existing ones (i.e., define new types). Some languages, such as Perl and Python, also perform type inference and do not require any type declarations.</p>

<title>TypeScript Programming Language</title>

<preview>TypeScript programming language is a more advanced version of JavaScript that includes more functionality.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is TypeScript Programming Language?</h2>
<p>TypeScript programming language is a more advanced version of JavaScript that includes more functionality. Programming in it is straightforward, simple to learn, and quick. As an open-source programming language, it has been available for free download and use since its inception. It is licensed under Apache 2.0 and can be downloaded from its official website.</p>
<div>TypeScript programming language supports a variety of programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and generic. It is regarded as an object-oriented programming language since it adheres to all the basic concepts of the OOP approach such as class, inheritance, and abstraction. Other concepts like polymorphism and encapsulation are also followed. Designed to allow for the development of massive JavaScript applications, the TypeScript programming language is a portable language that can be used as a transpiler to the JavaScript programming language.</div>
<h2>What Makes TypeScript Better Than JavaScript?</h2>
<p>When comparing two programming languages – TypeScript and JavaScript – we must take into account a number of elements, the most important of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Since TypeScript is a successor of JavaScript, it is necessary to have a fundamental grasp and knowledge of JavaScript in order to develop TypeScript code. Apart from that, you should be familiar with the concept of object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is both popular and simple to learn. Many online application developers utilize JavaScript in conjunction with CSS and HTML to design and develop web-based apps. HTML, on the other hand, is difficult to learn since it encompasses event handling, web behavior, animations, and scripting.</p>
<p>TypeScript acquired widespread acceptance in a short period of time and was used by a large number of businesses. If you want to learn TypeScript, there are several tutorials and manuals available on the internet. It does, however, have a highly active and supportive online community.</p>
<p>When compared to TypeScript, JavaScript does not have a proper developer community. However, there are several libraries, frameworks, and coding practices available in JavaScript. For this reason, it is important to understand the web development team structure that best meets your company's demands in order to maximize overall team performance.</p>
<p>As we all know, TypeScript was developed in order to overcome the limitations of JavaScript while developing large-scale, sophisticated applications. Because of this, TypeScript reduces development time and helps become more productive.</p>
<p>The sole difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is that TypeScript code must be compiled into JavaScript before it can be used in an application.</p>
<p>TypeScript provides variables declaration, a functional paradigm, and a type system, all of which are not available in JavaScript. In terms of syntax, it is comparable to JavaScript and .Net, and it has support for ECMAScript 2015 Standard features like modules, an arrow function syntax, and classes, among other things.</p>
<p>JavaScript is also defined in accordance with the ECMAScript specification. However, it is not a typed language in the same way that TypeScript is. It makes extensive use of structured programming terminology from the C programming language, such as if statements, do-while loops, switch statements, and many more. It supports event-driven programming as well as functional and imperative programming.</p>
<p>Because Microsoft supports TypeScript, it has a slew of industry-leading frameworks and editors. It supports error handling during compilation in order to eliminate problems at runtime, which is accomplished by close connection with editors.</p>
<p>As an alternative, there are several JavaScript frameworks available on the market to meet the needs of web development project requirements. Among programmers, it is a large ecosystem that is highly popular. You may locate developers who specialize in various frameworks, such as ReactJS, VueJS, Angular, and others, easily.</p>

<title>Typosquatting</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/typosquatting</url>
<file>typosquatting.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Typosquatting is a deceptive practice used by scammers to trick people into entering a counterfeit website and compromising their private information.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Typosquatting?</h2>
<p>Typosquatting is a malicious activity designed to trick those who incorrectly type a URL into a search engine. Hackers or cyber scammers will often create websites with close URL addresses (like gogle.com vs. google.com) and will make them look nearly identical to the login homepage. This can be designed to gain your sign-in information or other data about you. Sometimes these sites will sell counterfeit products that are close to the original. </p>
<p>Typosquatting scams can take the form of site imitation to gain advertising revenue by misdirecting traffic from popular sites. This can be done with related links, affiliate links, or by using URLs with slightly different spellings. This behavior harms both businesses and users looking to purchase products or services with a reputable company. </p>
<p>This tactic can lead to breaches in a person’s accounts if they choose to log in with a fake sight. Since the typosquatters will now have access to the person’s email and password, they can enter their real accounts and gain any information they have stored there, including bank details, crypto exchange logins, social security numbers, login details for other sites and other sites many other types of sensitive information. </p>
<p>Typosquatting is very similar to cybersquatting, in which case bad actors will purchase domain URLs that are as close as possible to popular brands like Nike or Apple. Since companies don’t want potential customers to fall prey to these scams, they will often buy the domains for large sums of money, and cybersquatters will benefit from the extortionary tactic.</p>

<preview>Unbanked refers to those that are either unable to access banking services, or choose not to.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Does Unbanked Mean?</h2>
<p>Unbanked refers to individuals who remain unable to access basic banking products and services, most of them coming from marginalized sectors of society, and thus, rejected by traditional financial institutions for various reasons. The unbanked also includes people who have chosen not to use banks or other traditional financial services.</p>
<p>In many cases, most of the unbanked are poor individuals who can not afford nor fulfill the requirements of opening a bank account. Despite governments’ efforts in working on developing new financial products that can help reach out to unbanked populations through microfinancing and other methods, many banks continue to deny low-income customers for not having enough resources.</p>
<div>It is the collective goal of the crypto ecosystem to promote financial inclusion via digital assets, smart contracts, and other forms of blockchain technology. Bitcoin and DeFi projects are by far the most promising solution to the unbanked as they offer innovative new applications that mimic traditional financial products and services that are freely accessible to all.</div>

<file>uncle-block-ommer-block.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>Uncle Block (Ommer Block) refers to the discarded block in the phenomenon when two blocks are simultaneously created, resulting in one block being omitted from the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an Uncle Block (Ommer Block)?</h2>
<p>The uncle block (ommer block) phenomenon is relevant primarily within the Ethereum mining context. This concept takes place due to the inherent nature of the Ethereum ledger, which allows for only one block to be entered at a given time. They are also referred to as stale blocks by certain users in the blockchain space.</p>
<div>In any public blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, users have open access to mining. Thus, a robust mechanism is needed to ensure sound validation for input data. The method found within the Ethereum blockchain system is one where blocks are individually registered on the ledger. In the case of a double-entry at a single point in time, the block would be counted, whereas the other would be discarded. The discarded block is essentially referred to as the uncle block and is crucial in ensuring that data alteration is avoided within the blockchain.</div>
<div>In order to understand why Ethereum structures its blockchain system in a manner that would give rise to uncle blocks, we need to take an in-depth look into how its data is structured. Several blockchains utilize the Merkle Tree concept based on which data blocks are linked to one another through ancestral relations, which include parents, children, siblings, and even uncle blocks.</div>
<div>It is important to identify that although the system rejects the uncle block (ommer block), the blockchain ensures fairness towards miners by not denying uncle block miners the reward for their efforts. Therefore, according to the coin’s commitment to a proof-of-work consensus structure, even uncle blocks are due to a specific block percentage reward along with transaction fees. This mechanism ensures somewhat of a level playing field for each of the miners, without a single party benefitting at the expense of the other. However, the uncle block reward attained through mining remains less than that of a completed block.</div>
<div>When a cryptocurrency decides to switch from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system, the reward structure for uncle blocks takes a hit as well. In that case, the uncle block miners will be awarded only transaction fees and not a percentage of the block reward.</div>

<h2>What Is a UNI Token?</h2>
<p>Uniswap is currently the largest decentralized exchange with UNI as its native governance token. As a UNI holder, you gain the governance rights that enable you to participate in the voting process of decisions related to the evolutionary trajectory of the platform. UNI holders will also yield beneficial results from the growing value of DEX over time. </p>
<div>Investors can contribute to liquidity pools to support Uniswap, an activity that offers good returns in the form of UNI tokens. </div>
<p>The maximum supply of the UNI token is 1 billion units. The maximum supply will be in circulation by 2024, as the project has a four-year vesting schedule. After the completion of this period, there’ll be a 2% perpetual inflation rate applied to the UNI token for the sake of maintaining network participation. Starting from September 2024, this inflation rate will be applied annually. One of the purposes of the perpetual inflation rate is to disincentivize passive holders.</p>
<p>You can use major exchanges to buy or trade UNI tokens against other cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, etc. It’s available on exchanges including Binance, Huobi, Uniswap, and Coinbase.</p>
<h2>What Is Uniswap?</h2>
<div>Uniswap is a popular decentralized exchange that facilitates ERC-20 tokens. The protocol supports the exchange of multiple tokens that use ERC20 standard on the Ethereum blockchain.</div>
<p>A critical factor in the rising value of the UNI token and Uniswap is the 24-hour trading volume. </p>
<p>Considering this healthy indicator, investors would want to jump aboard this fast-moving train. Indeed, Uniswap is performing impressively, but it doesn’t rule out risks associated with any kind of investment.  </p>

<h2>What Is the United States House Committee on Financial Services (HFSC)?</h2>
<div>The United States House Committee on Financial Services (HFSC) is a committee of the United States House of Representatives. It has jurisdiction over matters relating to securities, commodities, banking, and insurance.</div>
<p>The HFSC was established on December 7, 1865, as a select committee and was expanded to become a standing committee in 1891. The current one was originally known as the Committee on Banking and Currency until 1968, after which it adopted its current name.</p>
<p>The Committee on Financial Services is one of the most powerful committees of the United States House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Democrat Maxine Waters from California has been its chairman since 2019. The ranking member is a Republican, named Patrick McHenry, who is from North Carolina and has been serving since 2019. </p>
<p>The committee has 54 seats, with 30 Democrats and 24 Republicans. It oversees all measures related to the nation's financial services and all aspects of the economy, including:</p>
<p>Banking, insurance, and real estate industries</p>
<div>Securities and futures markets</div>
<div>Money laundering, terrorism financing, and other criminal activities affecting the financial system</div>
<div>The committee also has jurisdiction over housing finance reform and monetary policy issues. It also oversees federal agency rulemaking that implements laws within its jurisdiction. It also has jurisdiction over issues relating to consumer protection, including all laws, regulations, and executive orders pertaining to financial services and products. Other areas of jurisdiction include financial literacy, predatory lending, privacy, and national security issues involving the Department of Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).</div>
<p>In addition to its legislative authority, the committee has investigative authority in the departments and agencies within its jurisdiction. It considers whether or not these entities are fulfilling their missions and performing their duties according to the law. These investigations are either done through an oversight hearing or a subcommittee hearing, which is then reported to the full committee for consideration in a markup session.</p>
<p>It has six subcommittees including:</p>
<p>Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions</p>
<p>Diversity and Inclusion</p>
<p>Housing, Community Development and Insurance</p>
<p>Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets    </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Unrealized Profit &amp; Loss?</h2>
<div>Unrealized profit and loss occur when you have a position open in a security that has appreciated or depreciated in value. This is also known as paper profits or losses because you don't actually realize these gains until you sell the security.</div>
<p>Unrealized profit or loss results from holding a particular investment position, but which is not realized until the position is sold. Unrealized profit or loss is also referred to as paper profit or loss. Its calculation can be used to determine the current value of any investments held. If the value is greater than the original purchase price, it is an unrealized profit. Conversely, if the current value of an asset is less than the original purchase price, it is an unrealized loss.</p>
<h2>Unrealized Profit and Loss Example</h2>
<p>To illustrate, assume an investor purchases 100 shares of Company XYZ for $50 per share (a $5,000 investment). After holding the stock for 10 years, it has increased in value to $100 per share. The unrealized profit on this investment would be:</p>
<p>100 shares x ($100 - $50) = $5,000 unrealized profit</p>
<div>It’s a profit or loss that has occurred on a commodity contract, futures contract, option contract, or any other financial instrument but has not been &quot;realized&quot; because the position is still open.</div>
<p>For example, if you buy EUR/USD at 1.2510 and it is now trading at 1.2600, the trade has made 90 pips in your favor (1.2510 - 1.2600 = -0.0090 = 90 pips). However, you have not yet closed this trade and, therefore, this profit is unrealized — it can turn into a loss if the market moves against you and you decide to close the trade at a lower price (1.2600 - 1.2700 = -0.0100 = 100 pips loss)</p>
<div>Unrealized profit and losses are typically tracked as part of the mark-to-market accounting process. Trading needs continuous attention. This is especially true of day traders, who tend to trade as much as they can during the market’s opening hours – or even after hours. And when you trade a lot, it’s only natural that some of your trades will end up being profitable, and others unprofitable.</div>
<p>If you keep a track of how much money you make on each trade, this is what’s known as your realized profit and loss (or P&amp;L). But you can also track your unrealized profit and loss.</p>
<p>Traders often focus on their realized P&amp;L because it represents real (i.e., realized) gains or losses that can be used for tax purposes and reinvested in future trades. Unrealized P&amp;L does not impact taxes or account balances.</p>
<p>However, a seasonal investor or trader never makes the mistake of thinking that it isn't important.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Unregulated?</h2>
<p>Unregulated means that there are no formal rules or obligations applied by a federal authority to protect those involved in the said activity. </p>
<p>In the context of the financial industry, it means that there is no regulatory authority to protect investors and consumers from fraud, harassment, or other malpractice. </p>
<div>Cryptocurrency is an example of an unregulated and decentralized industry. It is not governed by a specified set of rules. However, it operates on blockchain technology, which runs on its specific principles. </div>
<h2>Is Cryptocurrency Unregulated?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency is growing in popularity, but is it unregulated?</p>
<div>The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) defines cryptocurrency as a commodity. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers it a security.</div>
<p>Is cryptocurrency regulated? Yes, and no.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why this is a topic of debate. It is important to recognize that cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology is still new for many countries, and many regulatory bodies include them in the gray area. All of the agencies involved with monitoring cryptocurrency have conflicting rules and understanding when it comes to its supervision.</p>
<p>Taken together, these organizations have issued warnings, guidance, and rules about cryptocurrency. But none of them has sole purview over the digital currencies – yet.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have, for the most part, been unregulated. Bitcoin is no exception. Like other cryptocurrencies, it is not backed by a government or central bank and has fluctuated wildly in value. </p>
<p>It's important to be aware of the risks involved with any cryptocurrency investment. And remember that there is no such thing as guaranteed returns with any kind of investment.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency regulations can be good or bad for the market depending on the specifics of the regulations. While regulations can provide more opportunities and trust in the cryptocurrency, too much of it can kill the market’s growth. If done right, regulations can help expand the investor base and create a sustainable ecosystem. </p>
<p>On the other hand, over-regulation can stifle innovation and discourage individual investors from investing in cryptocurrencies. Having some regulations will help legitimize the cryptocurrency industry and make it widely acceptable.</p>

<h2>What Is an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)?</h2>
<div>In the cryptocurrency world, unspent transaction output, or UTXO, designates an output of a blockchain transaction that has not been used as an input in a new transaction.</div>
<div>Bitcoin is the most famous example of cryptocurrency using this model.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Every bitcoin transaction has both an input and an output. The input is the address where the bitcoin is sent from, while the output is the address where it is sent to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The user owns the output of a transaction and is able to spend later in another transaction. This is contrast with bank accounts, which register debits and credits and send a statement with a running balance to the account holder at the end of the month.</p>
<p>In the UTXO model,  the total wealth or balance in a wallet is the sum of all unspent transaction outputs. It’s the cryptocurrency equivalent of getting change after making one or more purchases, which can be later used on further purchases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, Bob has 10 coins and wants to send Alice two coins. Bob’s wallet first unlocks the 10-coin UTXOs and uses all the 10 coins as input to the transaction. This transaction sends two coins to Alice’s address, while the remaining eight coins are sent back to Bob as a new UTXO to a newly created address.</p>
<p>If Alice had three coins before the transaction, her wallet now keeps track of two UTXOs: one from before and the other from the transaction made by Bob. </p>
<div>In the UTXO model, the total inputs must equal or exceed the total outputs. This is one of the preliminary checks validators run to verify whether a transaction is valid.</div>
<div>UTXO thrives in a decentralized system because it can check for double spending in a computationally simple manner.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Unstoppable Domains?</h2>
<div>Unstoppable Domains is the name of a San-Francisco based company that provides blockchain-based domain names to users — most popularly, .crypto and .zil. The latter stands for the Zilliqa blockchain, one of the blockchains used to power the system.</div>
<div>These domain names can also be minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to traditional domain names, ownership of a blockchain-based domain name is permanent and does not require yearly registration fees to renew the domain. In addition to conferring full ownership and control to users, a key advantage is that a blockchain-based domain is fully censorship-resistant.</div>
<div>Blockchain-based domain names can point to content hosted on the internet, on InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), or to cryptocurrency addresses. In the latter case, the domain owner can link their Bitcoin, Ether or other crypto wallet address to the domain and ask others to send crypto to the domain instead of to a complex alphanumeric wallet address. </div>
<p>The main goal of Unstoppable Domains is to help build a decentralized web, achieve censorship-resistance, distribute power to users and ensure that information and value transfers are efficient and accessible. To enable this, the company uses both the Ethereum and Zilliqa blockchains, rather than a centralized platform.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)?</h2>
<div>The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the US Treasury Department. Its main role is to compile and publish the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN), which is a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. The OFAC is tasked with imposing economic and trade sanctions on members of this list. </div>
<p>These targeted individuals and countries include terrorists and narcotics traffickers and those involved in foreign aggression, among others. Sanctions can be imposed for other illegal activity, such as cyber-terrorism. Their assets are blocked and United States citizens are prohibited from dealing with them. The sanctions are approved by Congress or by the president in a state of emergency. </p>
<p>OFAC was founded in 1950 when China entered the Korean War. In response, then-U.S. president Harry Truman declared it a national emergency and froze all Chinese and Korean assets that were subject to US jurisdiction.</p>
<div>In addition, the OFAC can also impose sanctions based on mandates by the United Nations. Some countries that are on the SDN list, as of 2021, are the Balkans, Zimbabwe, and Russia, further to the latter’s occupation of Crimea in 2014.</div>
<div>OFAC has started cracking down on crypto activities since 2020, investigating the transactions of the leading digital asset exchangeCoinbase, fining companies like BitPay and warning firms that assist ransomware victims to pay their attackers that they could be penalized.</div>

<title>Use Case</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/use-case</url>
<file>use-case.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A use case is a description of the interactions between an actor (human or system) and a system that leads to an event.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Use Case?</h2>
<p>In the context of software development, a use case is a description of how a particular actor (or system) uses a specific application to achieve a goal. The term &quot;actor&quot; can be thought of as the &quot;who,&quot; and the term &quot;goal&quot; can be thought of as the &quot;what.&quot; A use case must specify at least one actor and one goal.</p>
<p>Ivar Jacobson developed the use case format in 1987 to document complex requirements in a simple, easy-to-understand way. Use cases have since become an integral part of the unified process, a set of guidelines for developing large-scale applications.</p>
<h2>Importance of Use Cases</h2>
<p>Describing a user's interaction with an application in terms of use cases has several benefits:</p>
<p>It provides a big picture view that helps developers understand how users' goals are accomplished by using the system.</p>
<p>It emphasizes communication between stakeholders (both internal and external to the project) because it requires them to think about their roles and responsibilities for each use case.</p>
<p>It provides documentation that can be used as input for tests and other activities.</p>
<p>Use cases show how workflows look like, step by step. They help project team members (and stakeholders) understand what needs to be done, what the different outcomes might be, and which actors interact with each other during each step of the process.</p>
<p>Use cases are the bedrock of any software development project. They help the team identify key user requirements, ensure that the design and implementation are consistent with business goals, and provide an unambiguous checklist of what the software must do. This means they help teams avoid scope creep, one of the biggest causes of failed software projects.</p>
<h2>Example of Use Case</h2>
<p>Driving directions are an example of a use case that may be employed outside of software and systems development.</p>
<p>A motorist wishes to go from City 1 to City 2. The actor in this scenario is the driver, the goal is to go to City, and the system is the road network they will use to get there. Between City 1 to City 2, there is typically just one route that cars use — this is the common course use case. However, there are a number of deviations that may be made off this path that will still go to City 2. The expanding use cases are these deviations and varied paths. The purpose of the driving instructions is to show the motorist the turns and highway exits they must take to get to their ultimate destination.</p>
<h2>Use Cases Help Solve Significant Business Problems</h2>
<p>Let's say you have an eCommerce site selling a variety of products. You're an expert in the products you sell, but less so in the technologies that are used to build them.</p>
<p>How do you find out the best technology for your needs?</p>
<p>You could ask around your network, or read what others say on social media, forums, and blogs. But there's no guarantee that any of this information is accurate or up-to-date.</p>
<p>Maybe you don't want to risk it. After all, technology can be expensive, and you don't want to get stuck with something that doesn't work with your existing systems or meet your requirements.</p>

<title>User Interface</title>

<file>user-interface.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The user interface is the user’s interaction with a website or application using a digital device.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is User Interface?</h2>
<p>The user interface is the key to a successful website. The entire function of an eCommerce site depends on how well its user interface works. The better the UI, the more likely it will satisfy users' needs and meet their expectations.</p>
<p>User Interface is basically the overall look and vibe that a website provides. It includes the design, layout, form, color scheme, functionality, and more. These elements have a profound impact on users' experience with a site or app, which in turn directly affects the success rate of a business. So you must ensure that your site or app has a good UI design to help bring your users back to your site or app.</p>
<h2>Why Does User Interface and User Experience Matter?</h2>
<p>Most users will never tell you that they don't understand how to use your product. Instead, they'll simply stop using it. They'll never pay for it, refer it, or even talk about it again. Their only indication that something was wrong is that they didn't do what you wanted them to do. It’s the ultimate test of how well you've designed the user interface and user experience. </p>
<p>The way things are displayed and arranged can make or break the impression that users have of your product. It can also have a big impact on how likely they are to use it regularly in the future.</p>
<p>Good user interface design is one of the easiest ways to have a positive impact on your conversion rate.</p>
<h2>Features of a Good UI</h2>
<p>What a great user interface is, and what makes it that way, is a little abstract. There are a lot of components to an exemplary user interface — things like ease of use, aesthetics, and self-explanatory navigation need to be present to create a great user experience.</p>
<p>Designing an excellent user interface (UI) for your product is different from designing a great product. You need to consider both the functional and emotional aspects of a design to ensure that it is intuitive, attractive, and easy to use.</p>
<p>Trying to get your point across in fewer than five seconds of someone's time is no easy task, but if you can accomplish it, you're well on your way to creating an effective UI (user interface).</p>
<p>The following tips will help you make that happen:</p>
<p>Focus on what people are actually looking for! A home page is not the place to show off every single product or service you offer. Focus on the one that will help drive users to your main sales or conversion goal.</p>
<p>Use your top navigation to create a visual hierarchy! The path users take through a website will be different for each person, so use the top navigation bar to provide clear directions for users to follow. This can be done by using color, font size, and more.</p>
<p>Keep it simple! The best user interfaces don't try too hard — keep things clean and simple by using visual cues instead of text-heavy blocks of information.</p>
<p>Make it responsive! If your application is accessible across all kinds of devices, make sure it’s responsive and adapt to the targeted device. </p>

<h2>What Is UTC Time?</h2>
<div>In the context of cryptocurrencies, the crypto world runs on UTC.</div>
<p>In contrast to most financial exchanges, cryptocurrencies operate on a 24/7 basis.</p>
<p>Using a standardized time simplifies things greatly as cryptocurrency users are located across the globe and are trading in different time zones.</p>
<p>According to CryptoHash, 12am to 1am UTC is one of the most volatile hours for Bitcoin — and this may be because this period reflects the start of the evening in North America, and the beginning of Asia's working day.</p>
<p>Traders across all assets, including cryptocurrencies, often look to Asian markets for direction and often base their positions based on movements on the continent.</p>
<p>Another study by Forbes Digital Assets in 2019 identified 4pm UTC on a Wednesday as the most volatile timeframe for BTC across several exchanges.</p>
<p>The research found this time was 36% more volatile than the average of all time periods.</p>
<p>The research said this may have to do with the fact the time is right in the middle of the US working week.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the research identified the hours between 8am and 10am UTC on a Monday to be 35% less volatile compared with the average.</p>

<h2>What Is a Utility Token? </h2>
<p>Utility tokens are tokens that are designed specifically to be able to help people use something. The use of utility tokens is limited to the particular ecosystem that the utility token is designed for. For example, one day, Uber could have its own utility token which people use to pay for rides on the Uber network. Utility tokens are not designed as investment vehicles. </p>
<div>The SEC is constantly on the watch for new utility tokens and security tokens. The regulator uses the Howey Test to determine whether or not a particular token is classified as a security token or a utility token. Utility tokens are not subject to the same regulations and requirements that security tokens are, because they are not considered to be investment contracts. One of the most well-known utility tokens is Filecoin, which is a utility token that is designed to help users use the Filecoin decentralized data storage platform.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Validator?</h2>
<div>A validator is a crucial part of the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus mechanism whose responsibility is to verify blocks to earn rewards. </div>
<div>The decentralized nature of blockchain technology makes it impressive and so promising that more and more people are adopting it. Every blockchain has building blocks that are called nodes. They are responsible for holding data but this data needs to be first validated or verified on the blockchain network. That’s where a validator comes into play.</div>
<div>There are two common validation protocols of a blockchain network, which are Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.</div>
<p>Much like a banker who is responsible for verifying a transaction before its processing, a validator verifies each incoming transaction. </p>
<p>A transaction can only be completed and its record can be added to the blockchain once its accuracy and legal authenticity are checked—that’s done by a validator.</p>
<p>In the Proof-of-Stake mechanism, a validator determines whether or not a transaction conforms to the rules that deem it as valid. The entire process makes a blockchain network secure and transparent. </p>
<h2>PoW vs PoS </h2>
<p>Some blockchains work on the Proof-of-Work model for validation and some rely on the Proof-of-Stake method. For blockchains that follow the PoW method, miners solve complex mathematical problems—and other nodes cross-check that information - to earn rewards. This method requires miners to work as validators. The one who solves the puzzle first gets to add their block and receives rewards. </p>
<p>But what is wrong with PoW? Well, mining isn’t the best solution due to its requirements as it needs specialized hardware for producing the required computational power—and consumes a lot of energy. </p>
<p>Proof-of-Stake, on the other hand, doesn’t require specialized hardware or energy. This method focuses on the currency power by determining participation according to the coin supply.  The protocol selects the validators randomly in accordance with the staked coins. Validators in such a mechanism receive transaction or network fees as rewards.</p>
<p>In principle, both validation protocols share a common goal. However, Proof-of-Stake is considered to be safer and more efficient than Proof-of-Work. </p>

<h2>What Is a Verification Code?</h2>
<p>A verification code is a security protection method that is used to avoid internet bots from abusing or even spamming various online services. </p>
<p>If you've ever been prompted to solve a captcha when visiting a website and trying to fill out a form then you already know what this looks like. A captcha is a randomly generated code that appears as an image above a textbox. The site visitor needs to type the same code that appears in the image in order for the form data to be sent. Each time the form is accessed a different code will appear.</p>
<p>Captcha images are often a little difficult to decipher, even for a human, so as to prevent bots from being able to read them.</p>
<p>Aside from captcha images, another form of verification is a Google Verification code, which is a short numeric code that is sent directly to the user, typically through phone or email through which they verify their identity. </p>
<p>Users may need to enter a verification code whenever they try to create an account on Google, reset their password, or log in from a different, unknown device to their accounts for the very first time.</p>
<div>Note that this form of verification code is not limited to Google, which is just one of many similar options. Any service can provide website creators and users with a verification code service. These services are commonly used for both traditional banking and cryptocurrency accounts, e.g. two-factor authentication (2FA), which require a high degree of security.</div>

<preview>The act of restricting the sale of a token for a particular period of time.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Vesting Period?</h2>
<div>Vesting period, also called the token lockup period, refers to a period in which tokens sold in the pre-sale ICO stage and offered to partners and project team members as incentives for their contribution are prevented from being sold for a specific period. A vesting schedule is announced by the project to release these tokens at intervals throughout a given period.</div>
<h2>Major Reasons for Token Lockup</h2>
<p>A healthy token economy requires that most tokens are held by investors and not released into the market. Locking up tokens allows the team to prevent the value of their token from dumping. It also disables the team members to sell their tokens right after the trading goes live, hence, protecting the interest of the holders.</p>
<p>By locking up tokens, projects prevent dumpers from crashing the price as soon as the token gets listed on any exchange. It is usually a part of their anti-dump policy to attract more investors by gaining their trust in the longevity of the project.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Token Lockup</h2>
<p>Here are some of the benefits of having a lockup period:</p>
<p>Protects token holders from large price fluctuations, as early investors will have to wait for a specific period before selling their assets. </p>
<p>Token lockup provides time for a product to be developed and launched, especially if there is no prototype yet. During this period, investors can evaluate the progress of the project and decide whether they want to hold on to their tokens or exchange them for another currency, such as Ether or Bitcoin.</p>

<preview>A virtual Automated Market Maker (vAMM) is a system that provides synthetic (or virtual) liquidity, allowing traders to buy and sell derivatives entirely on the blockchain.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Virtual Automated Market Makers (vAMMs)?</h2>
<div>Virtual Automated Market Makers (vAMMs) are based on the concept of the automated market maker (AMM). The AMM is a system that provides an automated smart contract platform where traders can perform token swaps using liquidity from liquidity providers.  Building on this foundation, the virtual Automated Market Maker (vAMM) is a new type of AMM that expands its application from token swaps to derivatives, such as perpetual contracts.</div>
<div>An AMM-based exchange has two types of users: liquidity providers to provide tokens, and traders to swap available tokens. The prices at which swaps occur are determined by a mathematical formula. As the “virtual” part of vAMM implies, rather than swapping real tokens, vAMMs are used to swap virtual, synthetic assets like derivatives contracts. No real assets are stored inside the vAMM itself; instead, traders are able to make leveraged trades based on collateral stored in a smart contract vault.</div>
<div>vAMMs are used for price discovery in handling leverage but not for spot trading. Every time a trade is made, the vAMM calculates the entry or exit price in the same way prices are calculated on AMM-style exchanges. While first-generation vAMMs used a fixed formula for calculating prices, second-generation vAMMs use a concentrated liquidity design along with virtual tokens to allow makers to provide liquidity with leverage.</div>

<title>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/virtual-private-network-vpn</url>
<file>virtual-private-network-vpn.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a safe and encrypted network from a public internet connection – giving you anonymity and privacy.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Virtual Private Network (VPN)? </h2>
<div>A virtual private network, or VPN, is a service that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through an intermediary server in a location of your choosing. </div>
<p>There are a number of reasons you might want to use a VPN. The encryption ensures that no one can see what you're doing online, even if you're using an unsecured Wi-Fi network. A VPN can also spoof your location so that your computer appears to be somewhere else. This is useful for accessing region-locked content, like streaming video services, and for overcoming government censorship restrictions.</p>
<p>The most common use for a VPN is to protect personal privacy, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks. A VPN will encrypt all the data between your laptop and the internet connection — preventing anyone on the same network from being able to see what you're up to.</p>
<p>In general, VPNs offer several advantages:</p>
<p>Security: When you're connected to a VPN, your web traffic appears to come from the VPN's server instead of your computer. That makes it more difficult for hackers or identity thieves to track your movements online. For example, if you're in the U.S. and the VPN server is in Iceland, your browsing will look like it's coming from Iceland instead of your home country.</p>
<p>Anonymity: Because some websites block content based on where a visitor is located, using a VPN allows you to access content that might otherwise be off-limits.</p>
<p>Privacy: Many consumers are concerned about ISPs tracking their online activities. Because there are no logs of user activity (apart from payment information), VPNs have built-in privacy features that prevent tracking.</p>
<h2>How Does VPN Technology Work?</h2>
<div>VPNs create a tunnel between you and a server controlled by the provider. All web traffic between your computer and the server is encrypted (scrambled so it can't be read by anyone without the decryption key). This means that no one snooping on your local network will be able to see what you're doing online. It also prevents your Internet Service Provider from seeing which websites you visit. The upshot is that using a VPN will help protect your privacy from prying eyes and malicious hackers.</div>
<p>Tunneling is a common feature in VPNs because it's one way to avoid limiting users to specific websites or applications. If a user has access through the VPN, they can access anything on the network. Tunneling can also be used to allow access from outside your network. For example, some companies use VPNs so employees working remotely can connect securely to the company database even when they're working at home or on vacation.</p>
<h2>Why Is Online Privacy Important?</h2>
<p>Online privacy is the ability to control who can see your information online. This is a fundamental human right, and one that is becoming increasingly endangered as more of our lives move online.</p>
<p>Technology is making this worse by allowing governments and corporations to collect massive amounts of data about individuals, which can then be used for various purposes.</p>
<p>You can use a VPN to stay anonymous and maintain your privacy. </p>

<h2>What Is Virtual Reality (VR)?</h2>
<p>Virtual reality (VR) technology is used to simulate an immersive artificial world that can mimic or transcend reality. Virtual reality has many use-cases, encompassing entertainment, sales, education and training. </p>
<p>To fully experience virtual reality, viewers need a virtual reality headset. These are typically developed by companies such as Oculus, Sony, or HTC and incorporate technologies that help create a sense of immersion in a parallel digital world. </p>
<p>Specially designed lenses provide a sense of depth and dimensionality even where there is none. Cameras and/or sensors on the outside track the user’s movements and responses, as well as hand-held controllers. </p>
<p>In VR, the display is split between both eyes to create a stereoscopic 3D effect with stereo sound. Together with the technologies and input tracking previously mentioned, these work to create an immersive and wholly believable experience.</p>
<p>Note that some virtual reality headsets have a computer built inside of them that can itself  run or stream software. However, most of the time headsets have to be connected to a separate computer in order to support sophisticated and compute-intensive VR applications.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Virus?</h2>
<p>A virus, specifically a computer virus, is a piece of malicious software that infiltrates a user's computer without the user’s awareness. The virus can then execute a range of malicious operations on the host computer.</p>
<p>The term was formally coined by Fred Cohen in 1983 as a metaphor for the way in which a computer virus mimics the diffusion of an infectious virus between humans.</p>
<p>Computers are usually infected with a virus when a user unknowingly installs it via a downloaded file. The virus attaches itself to another program in such a way that the execution of the host program can trigger the operations of the virus at the same time. It can also self-replicate, and insert itself onto other programs or files.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that each and every computer virus out there is designed differently. Most of them perform actions that are malicious, such as destroying data, whilst some can stay idle until a particular computer operation prompts their code to run.</p>
<p>Viruses can also spread when the software or documents that they are attached to are transferred from one computer to another using a network, USB stick, hard drive, or other form of data transfer. </p>
<p>There are also viruses that implement stealth strategies to avoid their detection by anti-virus software, especially if the software is outdated. Some viruses have the ability to infect files without thereby increasing their size; others can avoid detection by simply killing the task (in the task manager) that runs the antivirus software.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Vitalik Buterin is one of the creators of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin.</preview>
<description>
<h2>Who Is Vitalik Buterin?</h2>
<div>Vitalik Buterin is the creator of Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, and is also one of the co-founders of Bitcoin Magazine. Vitalik began development on Ethereum in 2015 in order to introduce a blockchain network that supports decentralized applications (DApps), with the help of Gavin Wood and Joseph Lubin. </div>
<p>Their objective was to expand the use cases of blockchain technology beyond payments and store of value. Since then, the development of Ethereum focused on the improvement of smart contracts and the introduction of new DApps that offered new financial products and services responsive to the needs of its community.</p>
<p>Vitalik is also known for his contributions to the development of the whole tech industry, including $763,970 worth of ETH to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute and $2.4 million to the SENS Research Foundation.</p>
<p>Buterin, or simply Vitalik as he is affectionately known across the crypto space, was born in Russia in 1994 and emigrated to Canada as a child.</p>
<p>At 17-years-old, Buterin learned about Bitcoin from his computer scientist father. </p>
<p>In 2011, he started writing for Bitcoin Weekly, earning five Bitcoin per article until the website shut down. In the same year, fellow Ethereum co-founder Mihai Alisie, contacted Buterin to start a new publication, which became known as Bitcoin Magazine.</p>
<p>During the same time, Buterin was attending the University of Waterloo where he worked as an assistant for cryptographer Ian Goldberg.</p>
<p>Whilst increasing his involvement in the cryptocurrency community online and at conferences, Buterin was inspired to meet others who wanted to create an alternative to Bitcoin that extended its capabilities with a more general scripting language.</p>
<p>In late 2013, Buterin published a white paper describing this alternative as Ethereum, a decentralized mining network and software development platform that enables the creation of new cryptocurrencies and applications sharing a single blockchain. Many reached out to Buterin to discuss the concept after the white paper was distributed by friends and acquaintances. </p>
<p>In 2014, Buterin dropped out of university after being awarded a $100,000 grant from the Thiel Fellowship for innovators under 20 to pursue their inventions.</p>
<p>Buterin started to focus on Ethereum full-time with a team consisting of Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, Joe Lubin and Gavin Wood. The team announced the project in 2014 and released a publicly-available version in 2015.</p>
<p>Buterin and the team built Ethereum into the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.</p>
<p>In 2018, Buterin was granted an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Basel for his work and contribution to cryptocurrency.</p>
<div>Since then, Buterin has led Ethereum’s research team and has become a philanthropist, donating millions worth of Ether to various charities, institutions, and foundations. He also invested $1.4 million of Ether in 2020 to begin designing the new Ethereum 2.0 platform.</div>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A statistical measure of dispersion of returns, measured by using the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Volatility?</h2>
<div>Any cryptocurrency that experiences frequent and large upward or downward movement in prices is said to be volatile in nature.</div>
<div>Bitcoin — the first cryptocurrency to be created — is extremely volatile.</div>
<p>A good example that illustrates this comes between October 2017 and December 2018, when BTC hit then record highs of $20,089. Over this period, the cryptocurrency’s volatility neared 8%.</p>
<p>This is higher than the typical levels of volatility seen in other asset classes.</p>
<p>Volatility in most conventional assets is measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, also called VIX.</p>
<p>But in the context of BTC, the Bitcoin Volatility Index tracks the volatility of the popular cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Several factors increase the volatility of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Regulatory news such as announcements by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can greatly affect the volatility of cryptocurrencies — especially if there are fears that the ability to mine or own Bitcoin may be curtailed.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency volumes can also be sensitive to geopolitical news.</p>
<p>Bitcoin trading, and its price, surged in 2020 — and this was widely linked to COVID-19. The cryptocurrency appeared to act as a safe haven asset, and like gold seemed to be an attractive alternative to cash.</p>
<p>Central banks across the world have pumped billions of dollars into the economies to prevent them from collapsing on the back of COVID-19. This also draws people to Bitcoin because of how it has a fixed supply of 21 million.</p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts have voiced concerns that greater government spending will fuel inflation in the future, and cryptocurrencies can help protect against this risk.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Volume?</h2>
<p>Volume can show the direction and movement of the cryptocurrency as well as a prediction of future price and its demand.</p>
<div>The 24-hour volume section at the top of CoinMarketCap website shows the total value of crypto traded in the past 24 hours.</div>
<p>Volume is an extremely important indicator for traders to determine the future profitability of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<div>It also helps exchanges make money by charging fees on cryptocurrency trades offered on their platforms.</div>
<p>A greater volume of cryptocurrency transactions leads to fair cryptocurrency prices and removes the chance of distorted pricing.</p>
<p>A low cryptocurrency exchange volume signals inefficient or low trades, as the asking prices of sellers fail to meet the bids of potential buyers.</p>
<div>Cryptocurrency volume is similar to the concept of liquidity, but they are both not the same.</div>
<p>Volume is the sum total of actual trades taking place, meanwhile liquidity is the amount available for trading at any single price.</p>
<p>Usually, the higher the volume of cryptocurrency transactions, the more liquid the crypto market will be.</p>
<p>Low cryptocurrency volume exchanges, however, do create great arbitrage opportunities for investors.</p>
<p>Some cryptocurrencies can be bought at a very low price and sold for a premium elsewhere.</p>
<p>This normally occurs if the coin or token is not in high demand or there is something wrong with the exchange’s operational features.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Wallet?</h2>
<p>Just like you’d keep banknotes and coins in a wallet, you can do the same with crypto.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets come in all shapes and sizes. Whereas some can only support one digital asset, such as Bitcoin, others allow you to store multiple coins.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are physical devices where the private keys of cryptocurrencies can be held — but alternatives include wallets that are based online or inside mobile apps, and even written down on paper.</p>
<p>It’s also important to make a distinction between hot wallets and cold wallets. Whereas hot wallets are connected to the internet, cold wallets are not.</p>
<p>A common misconception with crypto wallets lies in what the private keys they hold are for. The information they store merely enables a user to access their assets on the blockchain. In this way, it’s comparable to the PIN that you might enter to log in to a bank account.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, desktop wallets are often installed on PCs and Macs — while mobile wallets pave the way for crypto transactions to be completed on the move.</p>
<p>Hardware wallets are often considered to be the most secure, and least prone to virus attacks.</p>

<h2>What Is Wallstreetbets (WSB)?</h2>
<p>Wallstreetbets, otherwise known as /r/wallstreetbets or WSB, is a subreddit for participants to discuss stock and options trading. </p>
<p>A subreddit is the fulcrum for a specific online community and their posts, hosted on the social media website Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a particular topic and is written as /r/ followed by the community or topic name – e.g., /r/wallstreetbets.</p>
<p>Wallstreetbets became popular due to the community’s use of slangs and memes and reputation for aggressive trading strategies. The Wallstreetbets community played a large role in the GameStop short squeeze, which caused heavy losses for several companies and short sellers in early 2021. </p>
<p>This subreddit’s reputation for circulating and encouraging aggressive trading strategies is due to the community’s focus on highly speculative, leveraged options trading. Members of the subreddit include young retail traders and investors that tend not to adhere to many conventional practices, such as risk management methods. There has also been a recent trend in the growth of no-commission brokers and mobile online trading platforms, both of which have encouraged this new online trading culture.</p>
<p>The members of these communities will often see high-risk day trading as an opportunity for quickly improving their financial situation. Bear in mind that there are certain members that resort to using borrowed capital to bet on meme stocks that rise in popularity within the community.</p>
<p>Some of the community’s more famous slang includes using “stonks” instead of stocks and “tendies” to refer to gains or profits. </p>

<description>
<h2>What Is WannaCry Ransomware?</h2>
<p>WannaCry is a piece of ransomware that can infect and spread rapidly through a number of computer networks. </p>
<p>WannaCry consists of multiple components and infiltrates the target computer in the form of what is known as a doppler, which is a self-contained program that extracts the other application components embedded within the ransomware. These components include an application that encrypts and decrypts data, files containing encryption keys, and a copy of TOR.</p>
<div>The program code is not obfuscated and is relatively easy for security professionals to analyze. Once it is launched, the ransomware attempts to access a hard-coded URL known as the kill switch and, if it cannot do this, proceeds to search for and encrypt files in specific formats, such as Microsoft Office files or MP3 files. This encryption makes the files inaccessible to the user of the computer. The ransomware then displays a ransom notice, demanding a specific amount of currency, usually Bitcoin (BTC), in order to decrypt and thus recover the files.</div>
<p>When it comes to Windows, the vulnerability that WannaCry exploits involves the Windows implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. The SMB protocol allows various nodes on a network to communicate, and Microsoft's implementation can be tricked, through specifically crafted packets, into executing arbitrary code.</p>
<p>WannaCry can be seen as a prime example of what crypto ransomware can look like and how it can be used to extort money. It does this by encrypting potentially valuable files and can even lock a user out of his or her computer altogether. Any ransomware that uses encryption is called crypto ransomware. The type that specifically locks users out of the computer is called locker ransomware.</p>

<preview>Wasabi is an open-source and privacy-focused wallet for Bitcoin, available for Windows, Linus and macOS.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Wasabi Wallet?</h2>
<p>Wasabi is a privacy-based open-source wallet available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It implements a trustless approach for coin shuffling with mathematically provable anonymity: Chaumian CoinJoin. Wasabi is the first full implementation of the CoinJoin protocol which provides confidentiality of transaction inputs and outputs by mixing transactions with other users. By interacting with its four-tab interface, you can send and receive Bitcoins using CoinJoin. You can also track your transactions.</p>
<p>Wasabi wallet lets you hide your all sensitive information with a click of a button. It protects you from shoulder surfing.</p>
<p>One of the main arguments for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency is that it offers the ability to transact in a truly private, yet transparent way. Anything that allows people to be more secure and independent, while also enabling more freedom and autonomy, should be celebrated. Cryptocurrency wallets are an important part of this equation. They allow you to keep your money safe and accessible, but they can also expose you to other threats if they aren't designed with privacy in mind. That’s where Wasabi wallet takes the lead as it’s believed to be the first wallet with commercial-grade privacy. </p>
<div>Wasabi protects your privacy by implementing CoinJoin. CoinJoin is an old technique for increasing privacy in Bitcoin transactions, where multiple senders and receivers transact with each other directly, without needing to trust any third party. Wasabi takes CoinJoin to the next level by combining it with novel new technologie,s such as Chaumian CoinJoin, Dandelion++ protocol, and Tor integration. This makes the transactions indistinguishable from each other in a way that doesn't leak information about who transacted with whom.</div>
<div>Wasabi is a non-custodial crypto wallet, which means you are the one who holds the keys to your crypto assets. It's similar to keeping cash in your hand, as opposed to storing it in a bank. The difference is that, with a bank account, the bank stores your money and keeps track of how much you have by updating their records accordingly. With non-custodial wallets, there is no third party involved - no middleman who can lie or make mistakes - so you are solely responsible for ensuring that your funds are safe.</div>
<p>The protocol aims to increase the privacy of Bitcoin transactions by allowing multiple parties to contribute inputs and outputs, and obscuring which output belongs to which input. If a user spends coins that were received earlier in the same transaction, the user is revealing a link between her past and present identities. The more often this happens, the easier it becomes to de-anonymize users through data analysis. In order to improve anonymity, users can bundle their transactions into one bigger transaction before broadcasting it to the network (e.g., by waiting for other people's transactions to arrive).</p>
<p>CoinJoin is a decentralized mechanism for anonymization that does not require trust between participants or the participation of any trusted third party (such as a bank or an exchange).</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Watchdog Organization?</h2>
<p>A watchdog is an organization that observes, inspects, or monitors the activities of another group or an individual (such as the government, political groups, and corporations). The term refers to the act of monitoring rather than the type of organization.</p>
<p>Counter to the common belief that watchdog groups are essential to keeping governmental agencies in check, some watchdog groups have been criticized for becoming too closely associated with their target organizations or industries. Critics argue that such associations could compromise their ability to act as independent watchdogs.</p>
<p>There are several different types of watchdog organizations, including:</p>
<p>These organizations use investigative journalism techniques to investigate corporate practices and report their findings to the public. They might also attempt to influence government policy through lobbying or other methods. Consumer watchdogs may focus on everything from food products to banking services.</p>
<p>Organizations that monitor corporate activity and hold companies accountable for wrongdoings are typically referred to as corporate watchdogs. They have power similar to consumer watchdogs, including creating reports and making recommendations regarding corporate behavior. Some corporate watchdog groups also have the power to file lawsuits against companies they believe have engaged in corruption or human rights violations.</p>
<p>Government watchdog organizations are necessary in all three branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial) to ensure transparency. The U.S. has numerous government watchdogs, including the Congressional Budget Office, Government Accountability Office, the Federal Communications Commission, and several offices within each state's legislature.</p>
<p>A charity watchdog organization may be an independent organization or affiliated with another entity or government. Charities are rated using objective standards that measure how efficiently they operate. They hold charities accountable for how they spend donations and advocate for donors to support the best-performing charities.</p>
<p>An advertising watchdog is a company that monitors the advertising industry for questionable marketing methods and practices. The goal of an advertising watchdog is to ensure that all types of advertisements are truthful and abide by the law. They also work to protect consumers from fraudulent claims and to ensure that the public is informed about the products they purchase.</p>
<p>Watchdog organizations also exist at the international level; for example, Global Witness is an NGO that investigates corruption throughout the world. It analyzes natural resource agreements to ensure that they comply with fair-trade laws and publicize their findings so that companies will be pressured to honor them.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a watchdog is largely determined by the resources available to it. For example, an independent watchdog typically has fewer funding sources than one connected to a corporate or government entity. The information available to an independent watchdog also tends to be less comprehensive because companies and governments have more resources at their disposal and can hide information more readily than individuals who operate independently.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Web 1.0?</h2>
<p>Web 1.0 is a term that is often used to describe the early version of the internet, which had its origins in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and eventually became a global network that represented, at the time, the future of all digital communication. Web 1.0 describes the first version of what eventually became a growing and evolving medium that expanded into a platform with many functionalities.</p>
<p>This early version of the internet had web pages that were joined by hyperlinks. These web pages did not have any of the visual qualities, controls and forms that we might see when we use the internet today. Web 1.0. Is thus often referred to as the read-only web, which is a web that was not yet interactive. The web user was passive and much of the user input actually took place offline. </p>
<p>A fun fact about Web 1.0 is the fact that it did not appear as a term until Web 2.0 was coined in 199 by Darci DiNucci. Over the course of these years, the web underwent major transformations. Keep in mind that most websites were originally built as static HTML pages.</p>
<p>Some typical Web 1.0 characteristics included static pages, website content stored in files, proprietary HTML tags, a guestbook, the e-mailing of forms, etc. In summary, Web 1.0 sites were static, were not yet interactive and its applications were proprietary. </p>
<p>The transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 occurred over time as servers were upgraded and its creators developed new skills, concepts and techniques. In addition, the average internet connection speed increased for the mass of the internet’s users.</p>

<h2>What Is Web 2.0?</h2>
<p>Web 2.0 describes the current state of the web, which supports more user-generated content and stability for front-end users than its predecessor, Web 1.0. </p>
<p>Web 2.0 does not refer to any specific technical upgrades, but rather to a shift in how the internet is used. There is a higher level of information sharing and interconnectedness between participants. If Web 1.0 was a read-only internet, then Web 2.0 is a read-write internet.</p>
<p>Users are able to enter a range of information into web fields and send it back to servers, so they can communicate with hosting servers in real-time. A user can access information, as well as send information back to the server in order to receive more targeted information or view other user-generated results. </p>
<div>Many web providers have been able to harness this interactivity to transform software and web services. Web 2.0 also marked a huge shift to cloud technology, as abstracting server hardware enabled companies to become more ambitious in developing their web-delivered services.</div>
<p>The nature of this technology makes it simple, as well as popular, to communicate information to either a select group of people or to a wider audience. Successful Web 2.0 applications include wikis, blogs and social networking platforms. Among the most popular are YouTube, Facebook and Wikipedia, to name just a few.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Web 3.0?</h2>
<div>Web 3.0 is the new generation of internet services that utilize advanced machine-based learning and artificial intelligence to connect web-based applications together and form a more personalized web. Web 3.0 is collectively designed to offer users more user-tailored content at a much faster rate than ever before. The new web will utilize AI-powered search algorithms, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and enhanced data analytics to make this possible.</div>
<p>The idea of Web 3.0 was first introduced by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, where he discussed the concept of the then-called Semantic Web. According to Berners-Lee, the Semantic Web should be capable of processing and analyzing every data available on the Web, including all content, links and exchange of information from people and their computers. He further added that this can greatly help in enabling machines to complement our daily activities.</p>
<div>Once Web 3.0 is fully in place, it is expected to make a huge wealth of information accessible to a variety of applications and websites online, enabling these systems to understand the data they gather from the activity of internet users. Note that tech giants like Google and Facebook will no longer be able to control or access user data in this era. Therefore, data privacy laws can no longer be violated by them in a similar manner.</div>
<div>Web 3.0 is expected to push forth the boundaries of peer-to-peer exchange of information by taking advantage of technologies like blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and open-source software, among others.</div>

<h2>What Is the Web3 Foundation?</h2>
<div>The Web3 Foundation was created to foster new technologies and applications in the field of decentralized web software protocols. These latter are protocols that use cryptographic methods as a means to safeguard decentralization, which is for the benefit and the stability of the Web3 ecosystem. </div>
<p>The Web3 Foundation Council’s members are founder Dr. Gavin Wood, together with Dr. Aeron Buchanan and Reto Trinkler.</p>
<div>The foundation focuses on developing Web 3.0, which is conceived of a decentralized and fairer internet, where users have the ability to control their personal data and identity.</div>
<p>The Web3 Foundation believes in an internet where users, not corporations, own their data, where global transactions are secure, and where online exchanges of information and value are decentralized.</p>
<div>The Web 3.0 technology stack has multiple layers. Layer 4  is the protocol-extensible user-interface cradle, known as the browser. Layer 3, comprises protocol-extensible developer APIs and languages, followed by layer 2, which includes state channels, plasma protocols, encrypted storage, heavy computation, distributed secret management and oracles.</div>
<div>Layer 1 is made up of zero or low trust interaction protocols, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), parachains, data distribution protocols and transient data pub/sub messaging. </div>
<div>Finally, layer 0 comprises zero or low trust meta protocols (e.g., Polkadot) peer-to-peer (P2P) internet overlay protocols, and a platform natural language.</div>

<file>websocket.txt</file>
<tag>Moderate</tag>
<preview>WebSocket enables two-way communication between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (which can be either an HTTP server or another WebSocket server).</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a WebSocket?</h2>
<p>A WebSocket is a two-way communication channel that stays open, hence the name. A WebSocket connection is initiated by a process named handshake where a client sends a HTTP request to the server, which establishes the session. </p>
<p>After the handshake, both client and server can send arbitrary data, with client-initiated messages acknowledged by the server by sending messages back to the client. Because of this full-duplex communication channel, control flow between client and server is returned to one-way messaging from two-way messaging when using HTTP cookies.</p>
<p>The important part is that it's an open connection between the browser and the server, and it transmits data in both directions.</p>
<p>WebSocket can be used for different applications, including chat rooms, poker games, stock tickers, multiplayer games, video streaming services, and many more. The only thing you need to do is open up a port in your firewall and configure your web server to use it.</p>
<div>Tons of data is transferred between the browser and the server, and sometimes it's just easier to open a connection and keep it open until the work is done. This is especially true when dealing with large amounts of data or data that changes frequently. The HTML5 WebSocket API allows you to do just that.</div>
<p>Taking advantage of WebSockets can allow web applications to function more efficiently by reducing latency, which in turn can translate into better user experiences. </p>
<p>Here’s how different use cases of WebSocket enable a better user experience:</p>
<p>Real-time web applications: WebSockets are bi-directional communication channels over a single TCP socket. Unlike HTTP, a WebSocket connection can be kept alive indefinitely. They are intended to be used for two-way communication between client and server where a large amount of data needs to be sent from the server to the client without losing any data or waiting for the client to request more data.</p>
<p>Trading websites rely on WebSocket channels, so users are always aware of the fluctuations. These website’s backend servers keep pushing data to the client end on the same open channel.</p>
<div>Gaming applications: One of the significant use cases of WebSocket is gaming applications, where it can be used to enable real-time scenarios. It maintains a persistent connection between the client and the server. This allows for real-time data transmission without refreshing the user interface. The UI won’t need to make another connection to receive data.</div>
<p>Chat applications: When messages need to be broadcasted among users, WebSocket is the ideal protocol. Chat applications establish the connection using WebSocket and reuse the same open connection to send messages. </p>

<preview>A term used to describe investors who have uncommonly large amounts of crypto, especially those with enough funds to manipulate the market.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Whale?</h2>
<div>Whales are often considered the opposite of a cryptocurrency fish or minnow, someone who holds insignificant amounts of cryptocurrencies and has limited ability to impact market prices.</div>
<p>Instead, whales are part of a special club of individuals and organizations who hold enough cryptocurrency to move its spot price on the market.</p>
<div>They tend to have an outside impact whenever liquidity is low, or higher volatility is high.</div>
<p>The biggest Bitcoin whales in the industry include Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, and Gemini exchange co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. From an institutional standpoint, Tesla and MicroStrategy appear prominently on the list as they own hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin between them.</p>
<p>Large holders of BTC are often called whales because they prevent BTC fish from swimming smoothly in waters.</p>
<p>The Pareto Principle asserts that the top 20% owners of BTC hold more than 80% of BTC’s value in terms of dollars.</p>
<p>Bitcoin whales often set speculation trends for BTC fish to follow. This can often lead to a repeated cycle, where BTC fundamentals become disconnected from the fundamental drivers of cryptocurrency markets.</p>
<p>In several cases, nobody knows the real identity of some Bitcoin whales.</p>
<p>Australian businessman Craig Wright was sued in 2019 for allegedly holding more than 1.1 million BTC.</p>
<div>Some market watchers have speculated that Craig Wright may be the real identity behind the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto.</div>
<p>Craig Wright says he helped create Bitcoin in collaboration with his friend Dave Kleiman.</p>
<p>A move of huge amounts of BTC, especially from older cryptocurrency wallets, often results in the speculation that Satoshi Nakamoto is active.</p>
<h2>Crypto Whale Tracker</h2>
<p>Many investors or traders track whale holdings and what they buy or sell, as whales are generally thought to be &quot;smart money&quot; and have more information over the run-of-the-mill retail crowd. There are numerous popular whale trackers sites, such as WhaleWatcher, WhaleStats, Watcher Guru and more.</p>

<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a U.S. bureau that analyzes financial transactions to prevent financial crimes.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)?</h2>
<p>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury that works by collecting as well as analyzing the information about financial transactions with the end goal of combating both domestic as well as international money laundering, terrorist financing as well as other financial crimes.</p>
<p>The mission behind the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use, as well as fully combat money laundering and its related crimes, such as terrorism, and even promote national security through the usage of financial authorities as well as the collection, analysis and dissemination of financial intelligence. </p>
<p>When it comes to its insignia, the FinCEN's insignia emphasizes the unique mission when it comes to safeguarding the financial system from illicit use. It features several symbols which are central to the mission.</p>
<p>The globe represents FinCEN's worldwide reach, influence, authorities as well as responsibilities.</p>
<p>The binary numbers actually mean FinCEN in binary code, as well as represent the financial data that FinCEN uses in order to keep the financial system secure, and the communities and families safe. </p>
<p>The eagle represents the strength, pure power and determination of the American people, as well as the position in the center which symbolizes the power as well as the commitment of the protection. The shield represents the national security mission, and the silhouette of a bank represents the complex financial system that FinCEN uses in order to help supervise and administer things.</p>
<p>FinCEN was established by the order of the Secretary of the Treasury on April 25, 1990. </p>
<p>in May1994 however, their mission was broadened to include regulatory responsibilities, and in October of the same year the Treasury Department’s precursor of FinCEN, the Office of Financial Enforcement was merged with FinCEN, on Sept. 26, 2002, after Title III of the PATRIOT Act was passed, the Treasury Order 180-01 made it an official bureau in the Department of Treasury.</p>

<file>when-lambo.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>A phrase referring to when cryptocurrency holders will become rich enough to afford the purchase of a Lamborghini.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Does When Lambo Mean?</h2>
<p>“When Lambo?” was a phrase that became common among cryptocurrency enthusiasts during the early days of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Lamborghinis are expensive cars that currently cost a minimum of $211,321 — and they were a sign of aspiration regarding what cryptocurrencies like BTC would one day be worth.</p>
<p>Many wealthy cryptocurrency investors have bought Lamborghinis as a symbolic gesture of their success in the market.</p>
<div>The phrase When Lambo shot to greater fame after the cryptocurrency Consensus Investment Conference was held in New York in November 2018, which came months after a monster rally in the price of Bitcoin.</div>
<p>Held every year, the event is the most important annual conference for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange rented three Lamborghinis at the event to signal the presence of cryptocurrency investors.</p>
<p>Peter Saddington, the entrepreneur and co-founder of VinWiki, was able to capitalize on his cryptocurrency holdings and managed to buy a Lamborghini with Bitcoin he initially acquired for $115.</p>
<p>He sold 45 BTC to fund a Lamborghini costing $200,000. That said, if he had waited a little longer, that crypto stash would have been worth many millions.</p>
<p>In April 2021, it would have taken fewer than 4 BTC to buy a shiny, new model.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Does When Moon Mean?</h2>
<p>The moon plays a significant role when it comes to crypto culture.</p>
<p>If someone asks “when moon?”, they are probably an impatient trader who is desperate to find out when the value of a cryptocurrency is about to skyrocket.</p>
<div>The term gained traction in 2017 when Bitcoin staged a dramatic increase in value, and euphoria spread about what lay ahead for the crypto markets.</div>
<p>It is very common to hear crypto enthusiasts say: “Bitcoin has gone to the moon.”</p>
<p>Some cryptocurrency enthusiasts often joke that “Bitcoin to the moon” term could represent the time at which its price will be high enough to fund a return tourist ticket to and from the lunar surface.</p>
<p>Indeed, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Investments, said in December 2020 the value of Bitcoin should be around $400,000 based on its relative scarcity and relative value to gold.</p>
<p>The term “when moon” is also associated with amateur cryptocurrency investors who pile into the industry with the hope of achieving skyrocketing profits.</p>
<p>To illustrate an example, a cryptocurrency buyer may tweet: “I bought a bag of BTC at $22,000, when moon?”</p>

<file>white-hat-computer-hacker.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>White hat hackers use their skills to improve security by exposing vulnerabilities before malicious hackers (known as black hat hackers) can detect and exploit them.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a White Hat Computer Hacker?</h2>
<div>A hacker is someone who uses their technical knowledge to breach limitations and security measures on systems. White hat and black hat hacking are two terms used to separate two types of hackers; one who does this to protect the system and the other one who exploits the vulnerability for his/her benefit. The way they do this can vary greatly, but the most common method involves using programming skills to find bugs that allow them to gain access to the system or cause it to behave in ways the creators never intended.</div>
<p>White hat hackers are also known as ethical hackers. They're computer security experts who specialize in testing the vulnerabilities of systems via penetration testing and other testing methodologies that ensure the security of an organization's information systems.</p>
<p>White hat hackers are needed to keep malicious hackers at bay. White hats hack into systems and networks to find vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could exploit for financial gain, fraud, or other nefarious purposes. They then work with the organization in question to fix those vulnerabilities so that they don't become a problem for users and customers.</p>
<p>In some cases, white-hat hacking is also done for sport — an ethical hacker might attempt to publicly expose a software vulnerability discovered by them but did not report to the company responsible for developing and maintaining it. Most commonly, however, white hat hacking is performed by paid professionals who use their skills to improve security in order to protect the privacy and personal information of those who use a given system or network.</p>
<p>The CEH certification is an advanced ethical hacking certification offered by the EC-Council (International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants). It is often touted as one of the most advanced ethical hacking courses currently available. The course teaches students how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems, using the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target system(s).</p>

<file>white-label.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>White Labeling allows a company to customize an existing product framework in order to rebrand and resell this product as their own.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is White Label?</h2>
<div>A white label product is a ready-to-deploy solution with a market-ready back-end and easy-to-customize front-end. The UI/UX can be quickly customized as per buyers’ brand requirements, and the software can then be quickly launched into the market.</div>
<div>White label products within the blockchain space typically involve generic software that has been designed, developed, and tested by a company, and is ready to be deployed by another after some customization. Buyers, typically companies, can choose their preferred customizations with this software and get started with their own digital asset business. White labeling is a simple solution to an expensive problem that streamlines the user experience across different platforms. Some common examples of white label products are infrastructure tool kits, coin/token launchers, wallets, and exchanges.</div>
<p>Developing a brand new technology or software takes time, knowledge, and resources. </p>
<div>White labeling saves time by enabling businesses of all sizes to seamlessly, quickly, and affordably access the benefits of up-to-date technology and software. By reducing the amount of time spent building new technology, companies can focus on their business model rather than the technology behind their brand. This reallocation of time allows third parties skilled in software development to keep up the high standard expected in this sector. </div>
<div>White labeling facilitates sharing knowledge in an exceptionally high-demand sector and promotes access to younger, smaller companies without the available time or resources to develop everything from scratch. It also makes cross-industry applications possible. More and more traditional financial companies are becoming digitally innovative with their product offerings. In a highly competitive market, where digital innovation is moving exponentially, white labeling allows companies to remain relevant without upsizing their departments.</div>
<div>Examples of white labeling solutions within the digital asset space include BTSE, CoreLedger’s TEOS, and White Label DEX, whose platforms provide Whitelabel marketplace software with varying degrees of customization offered.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Whitelist?</h2>
<p>Whitelist can take several different meanings in the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Users who sign up to the mailing list of a certain cryptocurrency company are often asked to add the company’s emailing to their whitelists.</p>
<p>This is to prevent emails from going to users’ spam folders.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency companies can also pay to be added to a whitelist of internet service providers.</p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, whitelists are most used in the context of ICOs, or in terms of withdrawal addresses.</p>
<p>Investors who want to participate in ICOs will normally be whitelisted after they provide their personal information.</p>
<p>Where withdrawal addresses are concerned, whitelist relates to a list of cryptocurrency addresses that are deemed trustworthy.</p>
<p>Only addresses that appear on such lists can withdraw funds from exchange accounts.</p>

<h2>What Is a White Paper?</h2>
<p>Whitepapers explain the purpose and technology behind a project.</p>
<p>They usually provide statistics, diagrams and facts to convince interested investors to purchase the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Producing a whitepaper is key a step required for a crypto startup to be considered legitimate and professional, as it helps investors understand how a business is different from rivals in the space.</p>
<p>Whitepapers differ from litepapers, which tend to be shorter, less technical and easier to understand.</p>
<div>One of the most famous cryptocurrency whitepapers is undoubtedly Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, which was published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Is Winding Down?</h2>
<div>In decentralized finance (DeFi), winding down is the process of unwrapping tokens back to their original form, which involves multiple platforms as well as other tokens.</div>
<p>For example, if a user is holding $fSNOW and wants to return it to its original form of $USDC, they will need to go through several complex steps.</p>
<p>First, the user will need to take $fSNOW from the Snowswap exchange and redeem it for $fUSDC on a platform like Harvest Finance, an automated yield farming protocol. From there, they will be able to exchange $fUSDC for $USDC.</p>
<p>In other words, the difference between winding down and a simple token unwrapping is that the former involves multiple tokens along the way, while the latter is an action that typically involves the usage of just two tokens.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Winding Up?</h2>
<div>In decentralized finance (DeFi), winding up essentially means wrapping crypto tokens through various projects in order to find the best yield. </div>
<div>Wrapped tokens are those which natively live on another blockchain, such as Ethereum, and bring interoperability throughout the DeFi space. The introduction of wrapped tokens initially started with Ethereum and its ERC-20 token standard. Today, there are many more, for example, wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), which began with Bitcoin and is now used in countless DeFi applications on Ethereum.</div>
<p>For crypto holders to get the best yield for their tokens, they need to go through a number of oftentimes complex steps. </p>
<div>For instance, if a crypto holder starts with wBTC and wants to get Interest-Bearing BTC (ibBTC), then they will need to deposit it first on Curve Finance. From there, the user will receive an LP token which they can take to Badger DAO and mint the desired ibBTC.</div>
<div>Similarly, if a user starts with USDC and wants to get $SNOW, then they first need to deposit that USDC on Harvest Finance, an automated yield farming protocol. From there, Harvest Finance will return fUSDC as proof of deposit. Lastly, the user deposits their fUSDC to Snowswap in exchange for $fSNOW.</div>
<p>This is what, in essence, winding up means.</p>

<title>x86 Virtual Machine (Qtum)</title>

<tag>Hard</tag>
<preview>X86 Virtual Machine enables Qtum developers to write smart contracts in a language of their choice.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is an x86 Virtual Machine?</h2>
<p>The Qtum team has created an x86 virtual machine (VM) for executing smart contracts in a variety of programming languages. This VM operates very similarly to the existing Ethereum VM, with some notable enhancements:</p>
<div>In the Ethereum VM, all smart contracts must be written in Solidity and compiled down to byte code executed on the EVM. In this Qtum VM, developers can write their smart contracts in any language that supports a JIT compiler, including C++, Java, Python, and others widely used in application development. This gives dApp developers much more flexibility in terms of smart contract development.</div>
<p>In addition to supporting the existing gas model on Ethereum (where users pay for each operation they execute in a smart contract), Qtum has also added two new pricing models: fixed-fee per transaction and fee per transaction.</p>
<div>The Qtum VM supports x86 registers and memory operations through a unified 16-bit instruction encoding scheme that significantly reduces gas costs in common cases compared to the Ethereum VM. This will allow developers to execute more operations per transaction and increase throughput on the Qtum blockchain.</div>
<h2>What Is Qtum?</h2>
<div>Qtum is an open-source blockchain project that aims to bring the stability of Bitcoin together with the flexibility of Ethereum. It was developed by the Singapore-based Qtum Foundation, led by Patrick Dai, Neil Mahi, and Jordan Earls in 2016. However, its mainnet was launched in 2017.</div>
<div>The protocol is a combination of Bitcoin Core, proof-of-stake consensus, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It allows smart contracts to be executed on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This uses less electricity than proof-of-work and reduces the risk of centralization.</div>
<div>Qtum employs a Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP) that ensures the blockchain remains functional regardless of what happens to a handful of nodes. DGP allows specific blockchain parameters like block size, gas price, and block interval to be modified without the need to hard fork. It utilizes a UTXO transaction model for faster processing of transactions, but it can also handle smart contracts just like Ethereum.</div>
<div>Qtum's DGP assigns node operators specific decision rights in regards to updates, such as hard forks. Node operators must reach a consensus before updates are applied to the blockchain. This prevents bugs or hacks from destabilizing the network and gives users clear guidelines for keeping track of updates.</div>
<p>There are other crypto projects out there attempting to achieve the same goals as Qtum, however, it is worth noting that Bitcoin's UTXO (unspent transaction output) model is what makes the platform unique. Qtum is a platform trying to produce smart contracts and dApps (decentralized applications) that can be used in enterprise environments.</p>

<title>Yield Curve</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-curve</url>
<file>yield-curve.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>The yield curve is a line that plots the relationship between yields and maturities of fixed income securities.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is a Yield Curve?</h2>
<p>The term &quot;yield curve&quot; refers to the graphical representation of the relationship between yields and maturities in fixed income markets.</p>
<p>The yield curve is a graphic depiction of the rates of return that investors can expect from various maturities of fixed-income securities, such as bonds and treasury bills. The shape of the curve is determined by the level of interest rates that prevail in the economy. Lower interest rates are associated with increasing levels of longer-term debt instruments. Higher interest rates are associated with decreasing levels of longer-term debt instruments.</p>
<p>It is a significant financial instrument used by investors to predict the economy’s direction. It compares the interest rates of short, medium, and long-term government bonds.</p>
<p>The yield curve represents the relationship between bond yields, expressed as an interest rate per year, and the maturity dates. </p>
<h2>Normal Yield Curve vs Inverted Yield Curve</h2>
<p>A normal yield curve is upward sloping, meaning that longer-term maturities have higher interest rates than shorter-term ones. This phenomenon is known as &quot;normal&quot; because it usually represents an economic environment in which people are willing to invest for the long term at greater risk in exchange for higher returns. </p>
<p>When the curve is inverted, or when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term ones, it indicates a negative economic outlook. An inverted yield curve can precede a recession.</p>
<p>Because of its close association with potential economic changes, the yield curve has important implications for investors and other market participants. For example, if the yield curve flattens out or becomes more horizontal, it indicates that investors are comfortable holding less risky assets for longer periods. This could signal a weaker economy as consumers begin to spend less and save more ahead of anticipated economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>The yield curve is used to gauge whether an economic activity is likely to accelerate or decelerate in the near future. Economists view an upward sloping yield curve as a sign that growth is likely to pick up while a downward sloping curve is taken as a sign that growth is expected to slow.</p>
<div>When the yield curve changes shape, it can signal that specific segments of the economy are about to outperform or underperform their peers. For example, if short-term interest rates rise relative to longer-term rates, it could be a sign that inflationary pressures are building and that a higher rate of inflation might not be far off. If long-term rates rise relative to short-term rates, it could be a sign that growth expectations are rising faster than inflationary expectations and that higher short-term interest rates might be on the horizon.</div>
<h2>How to Measure Yield Curves</h2>
<p>The spread between the rates of ten-year treasuries and two-year treasuries is one of the most often used techniques of determining whether the yield curve is flattened. This spread is charted by the Federal Reserve, and it is one of their most widely downloaded data series. It is updated on most business days.</p>
<p>One of the most accurate leading predictors of a recession in the coming year is the 10-year to two-year Treasury spread. Since 1976, when the Fed began publishing this data, it has precisely forecasted every reported recession in the United States. </p>

<preview>Yield farming involves earning interest by investing crypto in decentralized finance markets.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Yield Farming?</h2>
<p>Yield farming is a broad term — and in its simplest form, it involves trying to get the biggest return possible from cryptocurrency.</p>
<div>This could involve earning interest by lending digital assets to others, or locking up the crypto in a liquidity pool. Some decentralized finance protocols also issue governance tokens as a reward for participants — and these assets have become subject to wild speculation.</div>
<div>Yield farmers calculate their estimated returns using the annual percentage yield metric, because APY takes compounding into account. Investors will normally chop and change between different DeFi protocols in order to get the best deal possible.</div>
<p>But all of this isn’t without risks. DeFi protocols can be prone to smart contract bugs, and this can leave funds vulnerable. Because of that, it’s crucial to perform plenty of due diligence before getting involved in this craze.</p>
<p>This practice exploded in popularity in the summer of 2020, when the total value locked in DeFi protocols surged. Some of the most popular projects involved in yield farming at the time included Compound, Aave, Balancer and Curve.</p>

<title>Yield Sensitivity</title>
<url>https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/yield-sensitivity</url>
<file>yield-sensitivity.txt</file>
<tag>Easy</tag>
<preview>Yield sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity is a measure of how much a fixed income asset’s price changes due to the fluctuation in interest rates.</preview>
<description>
<h2>What Is Yield Sensitivity?</h2>
<div>The concept of yield sensitivity is vital to investors because it is a measure of how much the price of an asset will fluctuate because of an interest rate change. The higher the yield sensitivity, the more likely it is that the asset's price will decline on the rise of the interest rates.</div>
<p>Yield sensitivity can be positive or negative depending on whether a change in interest rate impacts the price of a bond positively or negatively.</p>
<p>It is typically measured by calculating the percentage change in price that would occur if a bond's coupon rate were to increase one percentage point. So, for example, a bond with a $1,000 par value that has a coupon rate of 5% and is currently selling for $1,050 would have a yield sensitivity of 5%. This means that if interest rates were to rise by just 1%, the bond's value would drop by 5%—to $950.</p>
<div>Treating interest rate sensitivity as an investment characteristic can help investors make better decisions about their portfolios.</div>
<p>Because interest rates affect the values of bonds and other fixed-income investments, investors need to be aware of their own sensitivity to interest rate changes when deciding how much exposure these securities should have in their portfolios.</p>
<p>Investors who are more sensitive to increases in interest rates tend to prefer investments with lower interest rate sensitivity — because they will be less likely to lose money if the market moves against them. Investors who aren't very concerned with rising interest rates tend to favor investments with higher interest rate sensitivity — because they aren't overly concerned with the value of the investment being negatively affected by a change in prevailing interest rates.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is Year to Date (YTD)?</h2>
<p>Year to Date is a metric that examines how an asset has performed so far in a calendar year — spanning the period from January 1 to now.</p>
<p>Here's an example. Bitcoin started 2021 at $29,032 and had risen to $59,056 by April 1. This would have meant that the world's biggest cryptocurrency secured year-to-date gains of 103%.</p>
<p>YTD is different from Year to Year, which compares two exact dates one year apart on an annualized basis.</p>
<p>Both comparisons are equally valuable to traders when assessing the performance of certain cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>YTD performance of a cryptocurrency is an important indicator of profitability. </p>

<h2>What Are Zero Confirmation Transactions?</h2>
<p>Every transaction must be included in a block in order to be acknowledged by the network as a valid transfer of funds.</p>
<div>Transactions made at the same time are collected in blocks, which come together to form a blockchain.</div>
<p>After a transaction is sent, it enters one of three states: Unconfirmed pending confirmation, confirmed or rejected.</p>
<p>Confirmation may be delayed if the transaction fee is not high enough for the miners who validate transactions or if there is a high volume of transactions waiting to be processed. Zero confirmation transactions are also known as unconfirmed transactions.</p>

<description>
<h2>What Is a Zero Confirmation or Unconfirmed Transaction ?</h2>
<div>A zero confirmation or unconfirmed transaction is defined as an exchange that has not yet been recorded or verified on the blockchain. To understand it in context, it’s worth recalling a few of the basic principles of blockchain technology.</div>
<div>A blockchain is a distributed ledger composed of an ongoing sequence of blocks. The blockchain is maintained by a network of distributed nodes that arrive at a consensus about the integrity of the data recorded on this common ledger. Any bad actors that intend to manipulate the blockchain would have to control over at least 51% of the computing power on the entire network in order to sabotage its integrity. </div>
<p>After sending data to the blockchain, users must wait for one of the modes that maintain the network to register and then verify the data before adding it to a block. As the blocks are connected to one another, each verified block confirms all prior blocks as well. </p>
<p>A zero confirmation transaction refers to a transaction that has not yet been confirmed on the blockchain and, as such, is not yet part of the blockchain.</p>
<p>You can understand this as a transaction that has already been initiated but has not yet been confirmed by the network’s miners. Only the actor initiating the transaction is aware of it, and until a block is mined and the transaction has been confirmed by other network participants, the transaction is said to have zero confirmation. </p>
<div>Keep in mind that the confirmation time of a transaction will vary depending on the volume of transactions on a given network. To use Bitcoin as an example, a Bitcoin (BTC) transaction that has been relayed to the nodes in the Bitcoin network but has not yet been incorporated into a block is referred to as a zero confirmation transaction. </div>
<p>A zero confirmation transaction can be noticeable in certain scenarios, as with a seller who releases their goods before a Bitcoin payment has been confirmed by the network, with the assumption that the confirmation will, over time, actually end up being confirmed. Typically, at least six confirmations from the network are required for it to be fairly certain that the transaction has been verified. </p>

<h2>What is Zero Knowledge Proof?</h2>
<p>Zero knowledge is a building block used for authentication and identification.</p>
<div>Zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make it possible to anonymize crypto transactions.  They allow a user to prove that a situation is real without revealing information about it. In the crypto world, this would make it possible to enable a user to prove that they do have Bitcoin without showing their signature or public address.</div>
<div>Bitcoin, for example, has the benefit of being a decentralized platform, but it’s still public and everyone can see the network’s transaction history. Because of this, some users hesitate to adopt this technology because of the lack of confidentiality. Hence the appeal of ZKPs in blockchain.</div>
<p>The lack of complex encryption and the fact that it minimizes information disclosures are two key benefits for zero knowledge proofs.</p>
<p>The applications of ZKP are not confined to cryptocurrency or decentralized identity systems. Indeed, they can also take part in the dissemination of sensitive information without citing sources.</p>

<h2>What Is a Zero Knowledge Rollup?</h2>
<p>A zero knowledge rollup is a type of layer 2 scaling solution that relies on zero knowledge cryptography (e.g. ZK-snarks or ZK-starks) to trustlessly record transactions that happen on the layer 2 and subsequently validate those transactions using a cryptographic proof system that is verified by a smart contract on the main underlying blockchain. </p>
<div>As a zero knowledge rollup relies on a smart contract to validate the proof of the transactions in the layer 2, the system has some inherent benefits, such as higher transaction throughput and finality time compared to Optimistic rollups. Examples of production apps that are running on zero knowledge rollups are the DeversiFi decentralized exchange and the Immutable X NFT exchange. </div>
<p>Zero knowledge rollups tend to support custom and specialist apps that are specifically coded for the rollup technology. However, several rollup projects are working on releasing zero knowledge rollups that will allow projects to launch their smart contracts on the layer 2 without any additional code development.</p>

<preview>A zero-knowledge rollup is a Layer 2 blockchain solution that performs computations and storage off-chain while funds are held in a smart contract.</preview>
<description>
<div>As demand on the Ethereum network started to rise with the NFT and yield farming crazes that began towards the end of 2020, the need for faster processing speeds and cheaper transactions increased. The solution came in the form of Layer 2 blockchains and additional developments like zero-knowledge rollups.</div>
<h2>What Are Zero-Knowledge Rollups?</h2>
<p>Simply put, zero-knowledge rollups or zk-rollups is a Layer 2 scalability solution that allows blockchains to validate transactions faster while also ensuring that gas fees remain minimal. Zk-rollups manage to perform better than traditional Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum because they combine on and off-chain processes. </p>
<div>While the Ethereum mainnet explicitly utilizes on-chain activities to process transactions and validate blocks, Layer 2 zk-rollup solutions introduce off-chain functionalities as well. One of the main components that allow zk-rollups to successfully validate transactions faster than Layer 1 blockchains are Merkle Trees.</div>
<div>Merkle Trees are an important mathematical structure that allow blockchains to ensure that no one can fake data in the on-chain records of a zk-rollup. Usually, a zk-rollup consists of two Merkle Trees which are both stored on a smart contract, or in other words, on-chain. One tree is dedicated to storing accounts, while the other stores all balances. Any other type of data generated and used by the zk-rollup is stored off-chain.</div>
<p>One of the reasons why zk-rollups manage to perform significantly better than Layer 1 counterparts is the off-chain storage of data. Merkle Trees only consist of the most important data relevant to the smart contract and are accessed and requested to output information much more infrequently than in Layer 1 solutions. This saves huge amounts of processing power and time for the blockchain. Consequently, as less of the blockchain’s capacity is utilized for transaction validation, gas fees decrease, making Layer 2 solutions, especially zk-rollups, a preferred solution for small-time traders. </p>
<div>Zk-rollups are becoming increasingly popular both among developers who are looking to boost usability, and among investors and traders looking for faster and cheaper transaction processing. Solutions like Zcash are gaining traction among investors because of their use of zk-rollups. As blockchain technology continues to develop, performance and pricing become better. Layer 2 solutions and zk-rollups are only the beginning of the next era of blockchain technology and advanced cryptocurrency systems. </div>

<h2>What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?</h2>
<div>Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), also known as Zero-Knowledge Password Proof, is a method of authentication in which no passwords are shared, making them impossible to steal. This method secures and protects your private chats &amp; transactions as the information can be confirmed using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) without disclosing the data to anyone else who doesn’t share authentication with the network. As a result, ZKPs have the potential to transform the way data is acquired, used, and traded.</div>
<div>A blockchain is a collection of records that is administered by numerous dispersed parties, each of whom has a copy of the list. Because blockchains enable all participants to observe all transactions, they offer neither privacy nor anonymity. </div>
<div>Zero-knowledge proofs enable the posting of private transactions to the blockchain while maintaining their privacy by offering a way to confirm that the transaction was completed successfully without disclosing the secret information utilized in the transaction. </div>
<div>In principle, ZKPs allow one party to show another that they are aware of a given value without providing any more information. </div>
<div>Zero-knowledge proof solves the core problem of security and privacy in the blockchain world. Multinational companies incorporate it to preserve their confidentiality and facilitate transactions over a secure network on the blockchain.</div>
<div>Application code is run off-chain, or by a particular (single) node on the blockchain network, and only a confirmation of its proper execution is sent to the blockchain for other parties to verify its accuracy. Zero-knowledge proof also helps in sending private messages without requiring the user to disclose their identity to the server. Unlike traditional messaging applications, software run on the ZKP protocol allows a user to keep their personal information private and only mandatory data is shared with the other party. </div>
<div>Interactive and non-interactive are the two primary types of zero-knowledge proofs. Interactive ZKPs require the prover to conduct a sequence of activities or actions in order to persuade the verifier that they have certain knowledge. The majority of the needed activities in interactive ZKPs mainly include mathematical probability principles. Non-interactive ZKPs do not require interaction between the prover and the verifier and provide the option for the verification process to be completed later on. These ZKPs necessitate the use of extra computers or software.</div>
<div>By integrating ZKPs with blockchain, users can securely communicate complicated documents. The unique aspect is that they can encrypt the data in chunks, letting users control the availability of particular blocks and the information contained inside them, enabling certain users entry while restricting others.</div>
<div>ZKPs have so far been the most widely used in Z-Cash, a cryptocurrency that enables secret transactions. The AdEx Network enables decentralized ZKP ad auctions, in which a user can bid on the cost of displaying an ad without disclosing the amount to other users.</div>

<description>
<h2>What Are Zk-SNARKS?</h2>
<p>Zk-SNARKs stands for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.</p>
<p>They help establish trust when interacting in a blockchain and considerably speed up the verification of a transaction — hiding details from prying eyes at the same time.</p>
<div>Zero knowledge means one party wants to prove some statement is true without revealing why it is true.</div>
<p>When interacting in a blockchain, a user may have to prove that some conditions are met before they can complete a transaction. For example, they need to prove they have sufficient funds to complete a transaction, but without giving away information on how much they have in their wallet.</p>
<div>Zk-SNARKs also come useful when proving one’s identity in a blockchain. For example, if B wants to verify A’s identity, they can send a secret message to A without telling them what it is, and ask A to decode the message using their private key. A can then send the message back to B, proving their identity.</div>
<p>Succinct means that the zero-knowledge proof can be validated within a few milliseconds, even in the case of statements related to large-scale programs.</p>
<p>Non-interactive refers to a zero-knowledge protocol where the prover and verifier have little to no interaction. This means they can only exchange one proof.</p>
<p>Argument shows it’s secure only for provers that have limited computational resources, which means that provers with enough computational power can convince the verifier of a wrong statement.</p>
<p>Of Knowledge indicates that it is impossible for the prover to create a proof/argument without having knowledge.</p>
<p>Zk-SNARKs records only the proof of the transaction on the blockchain node, safeguarding the identity of the sender, receiver and other details associated with the transaction.</p>
